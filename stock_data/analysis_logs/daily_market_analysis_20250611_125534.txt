Expect increased volatility and a downward trend in the short term. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, assuming corrective measures are taken.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to GDP decline. Volatility is high due to inflation. Market sentiment is low, reflecting poor confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to low unemployment, but overall weak. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect current economic concerns."

    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces cost pressures and regulatory uncertainty.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Decreased consumer spending and business investment will negatively impact manufacturing.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Inflation and economic uncertainty will reduce consumer spending, especially on non-essential items.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies face slowing growth and increased competition. High interest rates impact growth stock valuations.",
