    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a challenging environment: high inflation, negative GDP growth, low market confidence, and unemployment slightly above the natural rate. This suggests a stagflationary scenario, warranting a cautious market outlook.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic climate, a bearish short-term outlook is appropriate. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely pressure corporate earnings and investor sentiment. Expect increased volatility and a downward trend. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, assuming eventual policy adjustments.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to GDP decline. Volatility is high due to inflation. Market sentiment reflects low confidence. Momentum is weak due to slow growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to account for current economic headwinds."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decrease with high inflation. DIS and NFLX face headwinds.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face uncertainty due to potential recession and interest rate hikes. JPM, BAC, V, and GS are vulnerable.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces regulatory pressures. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Industrial activity slows down during recessions. CAT, GE, and LMT face challenges.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending declines during economic downturns. WMT and COST may see reduced growth.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies are sensitive to economic cycles. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA face mixed prospects.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Reduced economic activity impacts transportation demand. BA faces headwinds."
