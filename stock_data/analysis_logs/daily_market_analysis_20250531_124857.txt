  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of political and social commentary, with limited direct discussion of market-moving events. The high volume in Public Square suggests a general level of engagement, but the lack of specific financial focus means a limited impact on market parameters. The Congress channel shows some policy discussion, but the overall sentiment is neutral.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target (2.0%), necessitating a high volatility parameter. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates a recessionary environment, justifying a negative trend direction. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic concerns. Market confidence is low at 35%, reflecting the overall economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to the combination of high inflation, negative GDP growth, and low market confidence. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to consumer spending (e.g., Retail, Entertainment) are likely to underperform. Energy may see some support due to inflation, but overall, a defensive strategy is warranted.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic downturn. Volatility is set to 1.10 to account for the high inflation rate. Market sentiment is aligned with the low market confidence at 0.35. Momentum is reduced to 0.10 to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.35, reflecting the increased uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector may see some support due to inflationary pressures, but overall economic slowdown will limit gains. Focus on established players with strong balance sheets.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector faces headwinds due to reduced consumer spending in a recessionary environment. Streaming services may fare better than traditional entertainment venues.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector is vulnerable to rising interest rates and potential loan defaults. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on bank stocks.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector is relatively defensive but faces pressure from rising costs and potential policy changes. Focus on companies with stable revenue streams.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is impacted by slowing global demand and supply chain disruptions. Expect mixed performance depending on specific industry and geographic exposure.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector is highly sensitive to consumer spending and faces significant challenges in a recessionary environment. Discount retailers may outperform.",
    "TECH": "Technology sector faces mixed prospects. Software and cloud services may remain resilient, but hardware and consumer electronics are vulnerable to reduced spending.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transport sector is impacted by slowing economic activity and rising fuel costs. Expect reduced demand for freight and passenger transportation."
