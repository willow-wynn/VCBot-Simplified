SECTION I. Short Title
I. This actmaybe cited inpublic worksas the“Research andDevelopmentEnhancement
Act”,or the‘RDE’ Act.
SECTION II.Findings
Congress findsthat-

I. TheU.S. governmentsupportsa broadrangeof scientificand engineeringR&D. Its
purposes includeaddressingnationaldefense, health,safety,the environment,and energy
security;advancingknowledge generally;developingthescientific andengineering
workforce; and strengtheningU.S. innovationandcompetitiveness inthe global
economy.Most of theR&D funded bythefederalgovernment isperformedin supportof
theuniquemissions ofindividualfunding agencies.
II. Congress playsa central roleindefiningthe nation’sR&Dpriorities asit makesdecisions
aboutthelevelandallocation of R&Dfunding—overall,within agencies,and for specific
programs. In recent years,some Members ofCongress haveexpressed concerns aboutthe
levelof federalspending(for R&Dand for otherpurposes)in lightof thefederaldeficit
and debt.OtherMembersof Congress haveexpressed supportfor increasedfederal
spending for R&Das aninvestment inthe nation’sfuturecompetitiveness. AsCongress
actsto completetheFY2022 appropriationsprocess, itfaces twooverarchingissues:the
amount of thefederal budgetto bespent onfederalR&Dandthe prioritization and
allocation of theavailable funding.
III. Currentappropriations proposalsshowadecreaseof $13.8billion (8.8%)below the
FY2021 levelof $156.0billion of FederalR&Dfunding. Adjusted for inflation to
FY2022 dollars,the currentFY2022 R&Drequest representsa constant-dollardecrease
of 10.6% from the FY2020actual level.
IV. Underthecurrent appropriations,eight federalagencies wouldreceivenearly 98%of
totalfederalR&Dfundingin FY2021:the Department ofDefense(DOD), 42.1%;
Department of HealthandHuman Services(HHS),primarily theNationalInstitutesof
Health (NIH), 26.6%; Departmentof Energy(DOE),11.3%; NationalAeronautics and
SpaceAdministration (NASA), 9.4%; NationalScienceFoundation(NSF),4.5%;
Department of Agriculture(USDA), 1.9%; Department ofCommerce (DOC),1.1%;and
Department of VeteransAffairs (VA),1.0%.
V. Theagencieswith thelargest R&Dfunding declines (measuredindollars)inthe FY2021
requestcomparedtoFY2020 enactedlevelareDOD(down $4.713billion),DOE(down

$3.168billion), HHS (down$2.943billion), NASA(down$723million), andDOT
(down $540million).
VI.Theagencieswith thelargest percentagedeclinesin R&Dfunding inthe FY2021request
comparedto FY2020enacted levelareDOT(down47.6%), EPA(down 35.4%), DOI
(down 25.5%), DOC(down 22.7%), andDOE(down16.5%).
SECTION III.Definitions Associatedwith FederalResearch andDevelopmentFunding
I. Two keysourcesof definitionsassociatedwithfederalresearch anddevelopmentfunding
aretheWhiteHouse Officeof Managementand BudgetandtheNationalScience
Foundation.
II. Office of Management andBudget.TheOfficeof Managementand Budgetprovidesthe
following definitionsof R&D-relatedterms inOMB CircularNo. A-11,“Preparation,
Submission,and Executionof theBudget.”1This documentprovidesguidanceto
agenciesin thepreparation ofthe President’sannualbudget andinstructionsonbudget
execution. In 2017, OMBadopted arefinement tothe categoriesofR&D, replacing
“development”with“experimental development,” whichmorenarrowlydefines theset
of activities tobe included.Thenewdefinition has resultedin lowerreported R&D by
some agencies,includingthe Department ofDefenseand theNationalAeronautics and
SpaceAdministration. Thisdefinition isused inthe President’sFY2022budget.
a. Conductof R&D.Researchand experimentaldevelopment (R&D)activitiesare
defined ascreative andsystematicwork undertakeninorder toincreasethestock
of knowledge—includingknowledge ofpeople, culture,and society—andto
devisenewapplicationsusing availableknowledge.
b. BasicResearch. Basicresearch isdefinedas experimentalor theoreticalwork
undertaken primarilytoacquire newknowledgeof theunderlyingfoundations of
phenomenaandobservable facts. Basicresearchmay includeactivitieswithbroad
or generalapplicationsinmind, suchas thestudy ofhow plant genomeschange,
but excludes researchdirected towardsaspecificapplication orrequirement, such
astheoptimizationof thegenome ofa specificcropspecies.
c. AppliedResearch. Appliedresearch isdefinedas originalinvestigation
undertaken inordertoacquire newknowledge.Applied researchis, however,
directed primarilytowardsaspecificpractical aimor objective.
d. Experimental Development.Experimentaldevelopment isdefined ascreativeand
systematic work, drawingonknowledge gained fromresearchandpractical
experience,whichis directed atproducingnewproductsor processesor

improving existing productsorprocesses.Like research,experimental
development willresult ingaining additionalknowledge.
e. R&DEquipment.R&D equipmentincludesamountsfor major equipmentfor
research and development.It includesacquisition, design, orproductionof major
movableequipment,such asmassspectrometers, researchvessels,DNA
sequencers,andothermajor movableinstrumentsfor usein R&Dactivities.It
includes programsof $1millionormorethat aredevoted tothe purchaseor
constructionof majorR&Dequipment.
f. R&DFacilities. R&Dfacilities includeamountsfor theconstructionof facilities
that arenecessary for theexecution ofanR&D program.This mayincludeland,
major fixedequipment, andsupportinginfrastructure suchas asewerline or
housingataremote location.
III. NationalScienceBoard/National ScienceFoundation.TheNationalScience
Board/NationalScience Foundationprovidesthe following definitions ofR&D-related
termsin itsreport ScienceandEngineering Indicators:2022.
a. Research and Development(R&D): Researchandexperimental development
comprise creative andsystematicwork undertakentoincreasethe stock of
knowledge—including knowledgeof humankind,culture, andsociety—and its
useto devise newapplicationsofavailable knowledge.
b. BasicResearch:Experimentalor theoreticalworkundertaken primarilytoacquire
newknowledge ofthe underlyingfoundationsof phenomenaandobservable
facts,without anyparticular application oruse inview.
c. AppliedResearch:Originalinvestigationundertaken toacquire newknowledge;
directed primarily, however,toward aspecific,practicalaim or objective.
d. Development(or ExperimentalDevelopment):Systematic work,drawing on
knowledge gainedfrom researchandpracticalexperienceand producing
additionalknowledge,whichis directed toproducingnewproductsor processes
or to improvingexistingproducts orprocesses.
