SECTION 3. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
(a) The DoD shall establish a Headquarters Efficiency Task Force
(HETF), composed of representatives from key DoD offices and
components, to oversee and coordinate the headquarters
consolidation and size reduction efforts. Each DoD component
shall conduct a comprehensive review of its respective
headquarters organizations. This review shall include an
assessment of the functions, personnel, facilities, and costs
associated with each headquarters. Based on the comprehensive
reviews, each DoD component shall identify specific
opportunities for consolidation or size reduction within its
headquarters. These opportunities should be categorized as
short-term and long-term initiatives. The HETF shall prioritize
the identified opportunities and submit them for approval to the

3
Secretary of Defense and other relevant authorities within the
DoD. Implementation Approved consolidation and size reduction
initiatives shall undergo detailed implementation planning. This
planning should address timelines, resource allocation, potential
impacts on personnel, and strategies for achieving efficiency
gains. DoD components shall execute the approved initiatives
under the guidance and oversight of the HETF. Regular progress
reports and updates shall be provided to the HETF. The HETF
shall continuously monitor and evaluate the progress and
outcomes of the consolidation and size reduction initiatives.
Adjustments and refinements shall be made as necessary to
achieve the desired cost saving efficiency goals.
(b) The United States Navy shall be required to (1) report
sustainment cost estimate growth information to Congress and
(2) reassess shipbuilding programs that are experiencing a high
level of sustainment cost estimate growth.
(i) The Secretary of Defense shall
(1) change its definition for setting operational
availability for ships in its Joint Capabilities
Integration and Development System policy by
adding information that defines the operational
availability requirement by mission area in
addition to the ship level and includes all
equipment failures that affect the ability of a ship
to perform primary missions.
(2) change the definition for setting materiel
availability for ships in its Joint Capabilities
Integration and Development System requirements
policy to include all factors that could result in a
ship being unavailable for operations, such as

4
unplanned maintenance, unplanned losses, and

failures that affect the ability of a ship to perform
primary missions and (2) are set at the mission
level instead of ship level.
(4) direct the ASN (RD&A) and the CNO, once DOD
requirements setting policy is revised, to update
the materiel availability requirements for ongoing
shipbuilding programs. When developing or
revising these requirements, the Navy shall set
material availability requirements that fully
capture all factors that could preclude a ship from
being ready when needed.
(5) direct the Commander of Naval Sea Systems
Command to ensure that cost estimators follow
current guidance and GAO-identified best practices

analyses to improve their assessment of cost risk in
the O&S costs in shipbuilding programs' life-cycle
cost estimates.
(6) Institute a process for vigilant monitoring of orders
and expeditious resolution of lingering
reimbursements, with an objective to recover

overdue repayments owed by foreign partners for
