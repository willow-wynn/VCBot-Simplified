-# By Rachel K. Langford

*PORTERVILLE, Calif., PC (AP) ‚Äî A massive forest fire in Tulare County that has scorched over 18,000 acres and triggered mass evacuations in the Sierra Nevada foothills was sparked by an industrial battery fire linked to deteriorating power infrastructure, according to federal authorities now leading the investigation.*

The fire began early Saturday when a lithium-ion battery array near a PG&E substation in Porterville caught fire and exploded. The battery system, managed by EnerVault Systems through a grid reliability contract with Pacific Gas and Electric Company, was intended to store excess energy and help offset peak power demand.

Emergency response teams reported a ‚Äúcatastrophic failure‚Äù at the site, with flames spreading rapidly into nearby vegetation after a high-voltage transformer arced and collapsed, according to the U.S. Forest Service and Cal Fire.

Mandatory evacuations have been ordered in East Porterville, Poplar, and parts of Springville. The blaze‚Äînow named the Rabbit Ridge Fire‚Äîis burning through extremely dry forested terrain and is just 8% contained. One firefighter has been hospitalized with serious burns. Four EnerVault employees are being treated for smoke exposure.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a joint investigation with the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs Criminal Investigation Division and the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Eastern District of California. The agencies are reviewing potential federal violations, including environmental negligence, hazardous waste mismanagement, and false reporting of infrastructure readiness.

Internal records obtained by federal officials suggest PG&E had postponed scheduled upgrades to the Porterville substation for over five years. The company cited ‚Äúregulatory approval delays, jurisdictional constraints between state and federal agencies, and prolonged permitting processes‚Äù as reasons for deferral‚Äînot lack of funding.

‚ÄúWe are cooperating fully with federal authorities and remain committed to transparency,‚Äù PG&E said in a statement Tuesday evening. ‚ÄúThis site‚Äôs maintenance schedule was impacted by an unresolved overlap between state and federal environmental review requirements.‚Äù

EnerVault has declined to comment, citing the active investigation.

State Sen. Elena Rivas (D-Fresno), whose district includes Tulare County, called the situation ‚Äúa dangerous product of regulatory gridlock.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis fire may have started with a spark, but it was fueled by years of bureaucratic stalemate,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs lives and homes cannot remain secondary to interagency finger-pointing.‚Äù

Federal prosecutors have not yet filed charges, but a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office confirmed that a grand jury has been briefed.

Firefighters are bracing for worsening conditions later this week, as wind gusts up to 30 mph threaten containment lines.## Battery Fire Sparked by Failing Substation Ignites Forest Blaze, Triggers Federal Criminal Probe

-# By Rachel K. Langford

*PORTERVILLE, Calif., PC (AP) ‚Äî Wildfires ignited by a battery facility explosion in Tulare County continue to rage across the Sierra Nevada foothills as federal officials expand a criminal investigation and the Governor of Pacifica declares a formal state of emergency.*

The Rabbit Ridge Fire has now consumed more than 25,000 acres and remains just 12% contained as of Thursday morning, according to Cal Fire. Strong winds and dry terrain are fueling rapid expansion toward residential areas east of Porterville and north toward Sequoia National Forest.

The initial explosion occurred Saturday morning at a lithium-ion battery array operated by EnerVault Systems near a PG&E substation. Federal investigators from the Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency have since confirmed the fire was sparked by infrastructure failures exacerbated by ‚Äúlong-term deferrals in safety-critical maintenance.‚Äù

PG&E has acknowledged the substation had not undergone planned upgrades for over five years. In a statement, the utility blamed regulatory overlap and permit delays: ‚ÄúGrid modernization efforts in Porterville were stalled by protracted interagency review processes and jurisdictional inconsistencies between state and federal environmental bodies.‚Äù

The U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Eastern District of California confirmed Wednesday evening that a federal grand jury has been empaneled to review potential charges against PG&E and EnerVault Systems, including violations of the Clean Air Act, negligent endangerment, and misrepresentation of infrastructure status to regulators.

The fire‚Äôs rapid escalation prompted a sweeping executive order Wednesday from Jack Francis, Governor of Pacifica, declaring a statewide emergency. The order mobilizes the Pacifica National Guard, waives regulatory restrictions on emergency transport and procurement, and unlocks mutual aid funding for affected counties.

‚ÄúAll residents in evacuation zones must comply with public safety orders. The fire is expanding faster than models anticipated,‚Äù Governor Francis said in a televised statement. ‚ÄúWe are leveraging every available state and federal resource to protect lives.‚Äù

At least 3,000 residents have been displaced, and shelters have been established in Visalia, Lindsay, and Fresno. The Red Cross is reporting capacity strain as more residents flee advancing fire lines.

A senior investigator familiar with the case, speaking on background, said the evidence points to ‚Äúsystemic neglect masked by paperwork.‚Äù Investigators are also reviewing EnerVault‚Äôs safety protocols, fire suppression systems, and emergency training records.

PG&E previously faced felony convictions for its role in the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed 85 people. This case, according to legal analysts, could mark the first federal environmental prosecution of a utility for a battery storage-related incident.

The National Weather Service warns that fire conditions will likely worsen over the weekend, with gusts up to 40 mph and humidity levels dropping below 15%.

# One Year After Inspector Expulsion, Experts Warn Iran‚Äôs Nuclear Program Is ‚ÄòEffectively Unmonitored‚Äô

A year after Iran expelled all international nuclear inspectors and disabled monitoring equipment at its key nuclear sites, experts are warning that the country‚Äôs nuclear program is operating in what amounts to a complete verification vacuum.

In a new technical assessment released Tuesday, the Global Verification Initiative (GVI), a Vienna-based arms control research group, said Iran‚Äôs nuclear activities are now ‚Äúeffectively unmonitored,‚Äù with no access, data continuity, or reliable safeguards in place since March 2024. The group warned that this lack of transparency poses long-term risks to global nuclear stability and weakens the authority of the international nonproliferation regime.

The crisis began when Iran revoked access to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors and deactivated surveillance equipment at multiple nuclear facilities, including Natanz and Fordow. While Iran had long stepped back from commitments under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), it had continued cooperation under its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (CSA) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)‚Äîuntil the sudden expulsion of inspectors in March last year.

Since then, there has been no independent verification of Iran‚Äôs uranium enrichment activities or stockpile levels, and no sign of diplomatic progress toward restoring oversight.

**A Year of Drift**

Despite the severity of the breach, efforts to resolve the standoff have largely stalled. Early 2025 marked one year without inspectors on the ground‚Äîand no active mechanism for restoring access.

The last major diplomatic effort relating to the standoff came under the Diana Allar administration in September 2024, when the U.S. participated in Russia-led JCPOA talks in Geneva. While the United States did send a delegation, the decision for Moscow to lead the process‚Äîan unusual departure from past diplomatic norms‚Äîwas widely viewed as a sign of waning U.S. leadership and a lack of strategic investment in the outcome.

The talks produced no tangible results. No joint communiqu√© was issued, no verification path was restored, and no follow-up track emerged. Since then, there has been no visible effort by the U.S. or its allies to re-engage on the Iran file in any serious way.

GVI‚Äôs report is sharply critical of the lack of sustained engagement, warning that the international community‚Äôs passive response has effectively allowed the crisis to be ‚Äúswept under the rug.‚Äù

**Verification Vacuum Deepens**

Since inspectors were expelled, there has been no reliable data from within Iran's key nuclear sites. Without access to facilities, logs, or live surveillance, independent assessment of uranium enrichment levels, centrifuge use, or material diversion is impossible.

While satellite imagery can confirm construction and movement, it cannot determine Iran‚Äôs breakout potential‚Äîa measure of how quickly it could develop weapons-grade material if it chose to.

The IAEA‚Äôs own Director General, Rafael Grossi, warned early in 2024 that Iran's program was "galloping ahead" and that the agency had "very limited visibility." However, in the months since, diplomatic engagement has stalled and international focus has shifted elsewhere.

There are currently no public plans for high-level talks, no formal UN response, and no signs that Iran intends to reverse course. The IAEA Board of Governors has not convened a special session on the matter in over ten months, and Security Council attention has waned amid competing priorities.

GVI urges a coordinated international response before the issue becomes permanently sidelined. Its recommendations include restoring political pressure through the IAEA Board, expanding regional dialogue, and reasserting the central role of verification as a non-negotiable component of any future nuclear agreement.

# Shifting US commitments on the "One China Policy" Creates Uncertainty for the Status of Taiwan 

Washington D.C. - At a press conference, Secretary of State Hull stated that the President reaffirmed the US‚Äôs commitment to the 1979 Joint Communique, specifically citing that ‚ÄúThe United States of America recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China. ... The Government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.‚Äù IR analysts have argued that although the communique appears to conflict with the US‚Äôs recognition of Taiwan, the document's precise wording leaves a significant amount of ambiguity. 

In an interview with Michael J. Green, a senior advisor at CSIS, he said ‚ÄúThe operative word to focus on is ‚Äòacknowledge‚Äô. The US only acknowledges the one-China policy and that Taiwan is part of China. Before the conflict, this ambiguity formed the basis of the US policy of informal relations with Taiwan and formal recognition of China. With that in mind, a plain text reading of the agreement would indicate that a commitment to the communique is compatible with the US‚Äôs recognition of Taiwan, promulgated by President DiCarlo in 2022.‚Äù 

At the same time, other analysts point out that a reaffirmation of the communique creates implicit political commitments to adhere to the One China Policy. ‚ÄúThe US's intent behind the 1979 Joint Communique was to balance respect for the One China Policy and Taiwanese autonomy. On the former, this point was clarified in the 1982 Communique, where the US committed itself to not ‚Äúpursuing a policy of 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan.‚Äù This created an implicit political commitment that the US wouldn‚Äôt recognize a separate Chinese and Taiwanese state. Therefore, although the 1979 communique isn‚Äôt necessarily incompatible with recognition of Taiwan, it signals respect for the One China Policy and therefore the notion that formal relations should be pursued with China while informal relations are maintained with Taiwan‚Äù.  ‚ÄîBonnie S.

*May 23, 2025 - Boston, Massachusetts, OL*

Just hours after reports emerged of widespread food poisoning incidents affecting schools across the State of Jackson, health authorities have now confirmed a similar outbreak in the neighboring Commonwealth of Olympia. At least 5 schools across five counties in Olympia have reported clusters of students and staff experiencing symptoms consistent with foodborne illness, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

The Olympia Department of Public Health issued a statement early afternoon indicating that preliminary investigations suggest a potential link between the two outbreaks. Both states reportedly use the same regional food distribution vendor, raising concerns about a possible contamination at the source.

"We are taking this matter extremely seriously," said Dr. Lena Corwin, Olympia‚Äôs Chief Public Health Officer. "Our teams are working closely with school administrators, food safety inspectors, and the supplier to determine the root cause of the contamination. As a precaution, we have cautioned all schools to suspend the use of school provided meals pending further testing."
In Jackson, over 150 students were affected earlier today, prompting a temporary suspension of school provided meals and plans to launch of a joint investigation with the CDC. 

Parents in both states are expressing growing concern and frustration. "It‚Äôs alarming that something like this can happen in two states at once," said Naomi Fielding, a parent in Olympia. "We just want to know our kids are safe."

Health officials are urging anyone experiencing symptoms to seek medical attention and report their case to local health departments. More updates are expected as laboratory testing continues.

-# By Helena Madsen and Arjun Bell

PORTERVILLE, Calif. ‚Äî Cal Fire declared full containment of the Rabbit Ridge Fire Thursday, ending a nearly two-week emergency that burned over **38,000 acres**, destroyed **117 structures**, and forced evacuations across Tulare County.

No deaths were reported, but five firefighters were injured, and damages are estimated at **$1.2 billion**, including environmental cleanup tied to battery chemicals and transformer oil.

The fire was traced to a thermal failure in **EnerVault‚Äôs battery system**, with **PG&E‚Äôs adjacent substation** contributing a secondary arc flash. A federal investigation remains open.

### Internal Moves, External Pressure

EnerVault and PG&E have begun firing or reassigning key staff. PG&E announced a ‚Äúcompliance audit‚Äù while EnerVault replaced its VP of Operations. DOJ sources call it "damage control," as a federal grand jury considers charges.

Prosecutors are reviewing possible violations under **CERCLA**, **RCRA**, and the **Clean Air Act**, including claims of falsified safety filings.

PORTERVILLE, Calif. ‚Äî Cal Fire declared full containment of the Rabbit Ridge Fire Thursday, ending a nearly two-week emergency that burned over **38,000 acres**, destroyed **117 structures**, and forced evacuations across Tulare County.

No deaths were reported, but five firefighters were injured, and damages are estimated at **$1.2 billion**, including environmental cleanup tied to battery chemicals and transformer oil.

The fire was traced to a thermal failure in **EnerVault‚Äôs battery system**, with **PG&E‚Äôs adjacent substation** contributing a secondary arc flash. A federal investigation remains open.

### Internal Moves, External Pressure

EnerVault and PG&E have begun firing or reassigning key staff. PG&E announced a ‚Äúcompliance audit‚Äù while EnerVault replaced its VP of Operations. DOJ sources call it "damage control," as a federal grand jury considers charges.

Prosecutors are reviewing possible violations under **CERCLA**, **RCRA**, and the **Clean Air Act**, including claims of falsified safety filings.
