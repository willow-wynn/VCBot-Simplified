    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on legislative action and some political instability (resignation). This suggests some uncertainty in the market, but the high message volume in Congress and Public Square indicates engagement. The low activity in Executive and States suggests less immediate impact from those branches.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a mixed picture. High inflation and negative GDP growth point to stagflation. Low unemployment is a positive, but it's close to the natural rate, limiting further gains. Market confidence is low, reflecting the economic concerns.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment, the market is expected to be bearish in the short term. High volatility is anticipated due to inflation concerns. Sectors like energy and healthcare may outperform, while consumer discretionary and financials may struggle. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, assuming eventual policy adjustments.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to GDP decline. Volatility is high due to inflation. Market sentiment aligns with low confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to low unemployment. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect current economic concerns."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive: High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative: Consumer spending may decline due to inflation, impacting entertainment. DIS and NFLX face challenges.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative: Rising interest rates and economic uncertainty may hurt financial institutions. JPM, BAC, V, and GS are vulnerable.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive: Healthcare is generally recession-resistant. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are expected to maintain stable performance.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral: Manufacturing faces mixed signals. CAT and GE are influenced by infrastructure spending and global demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative: Consumer spending is likely to decrease due to inflation. WMT, COST, and HD may see reduced sales growth.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative: Tech faces valuation concerns and potential regulatory headwinds. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are sensitive to market sentiment.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral: Transportation is affected by economic activity. BA is influenced by airline industry performance and geopolitical factors."
