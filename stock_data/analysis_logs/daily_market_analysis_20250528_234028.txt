Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, further indicating economic weakness. Market confidence is low, reflecting the overall economic anxiety.",

Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence. Momentum is reduced due to the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the increased economic uncertainty."

    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative: Inflation impacts consumer spending. WMT, COST, HD face mixed prospects.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative: High-growth tech stocks are sensitive to interest rates and economic slowdown. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA face pressure.",
