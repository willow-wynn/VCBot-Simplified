  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in political discussions (Public Square and Congress), suggesting potential volatility related to policy changes. The Executive branch's veto of the American Symbols Act indicates potential gridlock, further contributing to uncertainty. This translates to a slightly negative sentiment overall.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) necessitates a high volatility parameter. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) and an unemployment rate slightly above the natural rate (4.2% vs. 3.5-4.0%) contribute to a negative trend direction and reduced momentum. Market confidence is low (35%), directly impacting market sentiment.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to the combination of high inflation, negative GDP growth, and low market confidence. Energy sector may see some gains due to inflation. Defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples may outperform. Growth stocks and cyclical sectors are expected to underperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic slowdown. Volatility is set to 1.15 to account for the high inflation rate and uncertainty. Market sentiment is aligned with the low market confidence at 0.35. Momentum is reduced to 0.20 due to the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly adjusted to 0.35, reflecting a cautious but not entirely pessimistic view."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive: High inflation and potential supply constraints may drive energy prices higher. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to benefit.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative: Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty. DIS and NFLX may face challenges.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative: Banks may face headwinds from a slowing economy and potential interest rate hikes. JPM, BAC, GS, and BRK.B are expected to be moderately impacted.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive: Healthcare is a defensive sector and may outperform during economic downturns. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are expected to be relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral to Negative: Manufacturing may be affected by slowing global demand. CAT and GE are expected to face moderate challenges.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral: Consumer staples may hold up better than discretionary retail. WMT and COST are expected to be relatively stable, while HD may face some headwinds.",
    "TECH": "Negative: Tech stocks are generally more sensitive to economic cycles and may underperform during downturns. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are expected to face challenges.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative: The transportation sector is closely tied to economic activity and may suffer during a slowdown. BA is expected to be negatively impacted."
