    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation, negative GDP growth, and elevated unemployment create a stagflationary environment. Market confidence is low, reflecting the economic uncertainty. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major concern.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to the weak economic indicators and low market confidence. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic growth, such as consumer discretionary and financials, are likely to underperform. Defensive sectors, such as healthcare and energy, may offer some protection.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, aligning with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting some underlying economic activity. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to high oil prices and inflation. Demand remains strong, supporting profitability.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook due to concerns about consumer spending and potential recession. Streaming services face increased competition.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to negative outlook due to rising interest rates and potential for loan losses. Regulatory scrutiny remains a concern.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive outlook as a defensive sector. Demand for healthcare services remains stable regardless of economic conditions.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook due to slowing economic growth and supply chain disruptions. Capital spending is likely to decline.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative outlook due to concerns about consumer spending and inflation. Discount retailers may outperform.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to negative outlook due to high valuations and potential for slowing growth. Cybersecurity remains a key area of investment.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral outlook due to mixed signals. Increased travel demand is offset by high fuel costs and supply chain issues."
