SECTION 104. FINDINGS
(a) ISS FINDINGS — Congress finds that —
(i) The ISS is a valuable, recognisable, beloved by the
public, international collaboration, that should be
maintained to train astronauts, perform
psychological and physical experiments, and
additionally test space systems in orbit.
(ii) As such, the ISS should remain operational until
2025 to protect it.
(b) SLS FINDINGS — Congress finds that —
(i) The SLS Lander program needs to be enhanced to
have deadlines to ensure that all components of the
SLS are ready for EM-2 and EM-3.
(ii) The SLS Lander program needs to have
requirements for general launch and procedure, as
well as reusing tried and tested technologies.
(iii) Orion and SLS also need to have their deadlines
pushed back in construction.
(iv) Orion and SLS additionally do not need to dock to
the ISS anymore.
(c) JWST FINDINGS — Congress finds that —
(i) The JWST costs between $300,000,000 and
$500,000,000 mil yearly.
(ii) The cuts to the JWST will be equivalent to the
funding for Space Debris Cleanup Technologies, and
as such, will provide no change in appropriations.
(d) SPACE DEBRIS FINDINGS — Congress finds that —
(i) Space debris are highly dangerous and can, and has
caused, problems on spacecraft, manned or
unmanned, including the ISS.
(ii) The butterfly effect method of multiplication of space
debris increases the threat of space debris.
