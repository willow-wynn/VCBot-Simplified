(53C) The term "swap participant" means an entity that, at any time before the filing of the
petition, has an outstanding swap agreement with the debtor.
(56A) 4 The term "term overriding royalty" means an interest in liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons

use agreement, or by any other means, whereby a purchaser, in exchange for consideration,
receives a right to use accommodations, facilities, or recreational sites, whether improved or
unimproved, for a specific period of time less than a full year during any given year, but not
necessarily for consecutive years, and which extends for a period of more than three years. A
"timeshare interest" is that interest purchased in a timeshare plan which grants the purchaser the
right to use and occupy accommodations, facilities, or recreational sites, whether improved or
unimproved, pursuant to a timeshare plan.
(54) The term "transfer" means—
(A) the creation of a lien;
(B) the retention of title as a security interest;

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 101(2) defines "affiliate." The House amendment contains a provision that is a compromise
between the definition in the House-passed version of H.R. 8200 and the Senate amendment in the nature of a
substitute to H.R. 8200. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) are derived from the Senate amendment and subparagraph
(D) is taken from the House bill, while subparagraph (C) represents a compromise, taking the House position
with respect to a person whose business is operated under a lease or an operating agreement by the debtor and
with respect to a person substantially all of whose property is operated under an operating agreement by the
debtor and with respect to a person substantially all of whose property is operated under an operating
agreement by the debtor and the Senate position on leased property. Thus, the definition of "affiliate" excludes
persons substantially all of whose property is operated under a lease agreement by a debtor, such as a small
company which owns equipment all of which is leased to a larger nonrelated company.
Section 101(4)(B) represents a modification of the House-passed bill to include the definition of "claim" a
right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment. This is
intended to cause the liquidation or estimation of contingent rights of payment for which there may be an
alternative equitable remedy with the result that the equitable remedy will be susceptible to being discharged
in bankruptcy. For example, in some States, a judgment for specific performance may be satisfied by an
alternative right to payment, in the event performance is refused; in that event, the creditor entitled to specific
performance would have a "claim" for purposes of a proceeding under title 11.
On the other hand, rights to an equitable remedy for a breach of performance with respect to which such
breach does not give rise to a right to payment are not "claims" and would therefore not be susceptible to
discharge in bankruptcy.
In a case under chapter 9 to title 11, "claim" does not include a right to payment under an industrial
development bond issued by a municipality as a matter of convenience for a third party.
Municipalities are authorized, under section 103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended [title
26], to issue tax-exempt industrial development revenue bonds to provide for the financing of certain projects
for privately owned companies. The bonds are sold on the basis of the credit of the company on whose behalf
they are issued, and the principal, interest, and premium, if any, are payable solely from payments made by
the company to the trustee under the bond indenture and do not constitute claims on the tax revenues or other
funds of the issuing municipalities. The municipality merely acts as the vehicle to enable the bonds to be
issued on a tax-exempt basis. Claims that arise by virtue of these bonds are not among the claims defined by
this paragraph and amounts owed by private companies to the holders of industrial development revenue
bonds are not to be included among the assets of the municipality that would be affected by the plan.
Section 101(6) defines "community claim" as provided by the Senate amendment in order to indicate that a
community claim exists whether or not there is community property in the estate as of the commencement of
[Release Point 118-106]
the case.
Section 101(7) of the House amendment contains a definition of consumer debt identical to the definition in
the House bill and Senate amendment. A consumer debt does not include a debt to any extent the debt is
secured by real property.
Section 101(9) of the Senate amendment contained a definition of "court." The House amendment deletes
the provision as unnecessary in light of the pervasive jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court under all chapters of
title 11 as indicated in title II of the House amendment to H.R. 8200.
Section 101(11) defines "debt" to mean liability on a claim, as was contained in the House-passed version
of H.R. 8200. The Senate amendment contained language indicating that "debt" does not include a policy loan
made by a life insurance company to the debtor. That language is deleted in the House amendment as
unnecessary since a life insurance company clearly has no right to have a policy loan repaid by the debtor,
although such company does have a right of offset with respect to such policy loan. Clearly, then, a "debt"
does not include a policy loan made by a life insurance company. Inclusion of the language contained in the
Senate amendment would have required elaboration of other legal relationships not arising by a liability on a
claim. Further the language would have required clarification that interest on a policy loan made by a life
insurance company is a debt, and that the insurance company does have right to payment to that interest.
Section 101(14) adopts the definition of "entity" contained in the Senate-passed version of H.R. 8200. Since
the Senate amendment to H.R. 8200 deleted the U.S. trustee, a corresponding definitional change is made in
chapter 15 of the House amendment for U.S. trustees under the pilot program. Adoption by the House
amendment of a pilot program for U.S. trustees under chapter 15 requires insertion of "United States trustee"
in many sections. Several provisions in chapter 15 of the House amendment that relate to the U.S. trustee were
not contained in the Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute.
Section 101(17) defines "farmer," as in the Senate amendment with an income limitation percentage of 80
percent instead of 75 percent.
Section 101(18) contains a new definition of "farming operation" derived from present law and the
definition of "farmer" in the Senate amendment. This definition gives a broad construction to the term
"farming operation".
Section 101(20) contains a definition of "foreign representative". It clarifies the House bill and Senate
amendment by indicating that a foreign representative must be duly selected in a foreign proceeding.
Section 101(35) defines "security" as contained in the Senate amendment. H.R. 8200 as adopted by the
House excluded certain commercial notes from the definition of "security", and that exclusion is deleted.
Section 101(40) defines "transfer" as in the Senate amendment. The definition contained in H.R. 8200 as
passed by the House included "setoff" in the definition of "transfer". Inclusion of "setoff" is deleted. The
effect is that a "setoff" is not subject to being set aside as a preferential "transfer" but will be subject to special
rules.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 101 of title 11 contains 40 definitions:
Paragraph (1) defines "accountant" as an accountant authorized under applicable law to practice accounting.
The term includes a professional accounting association, corporation, or partnership if applicable law
authorizes such a unit to practice accounting.
Paragraph (2) defines "affiliate." An affiliate is an entity with a close relationship to the debtor. It includes a
20 percent parent or subsidiary of the debtor, whether a corporate, partnership, individual, or estate parent.
The use of "directly or indirectly" in subparagraphs (A) and (B) is intended to cover situations in which
there is an opportunity to control, and where the existence of that opportunity operates as indirect control.
"Affiliate" is defined primarily for use in the definition of insider, infra, and for use in the chapter 11
reorganization cases. The definition of "affiliate" does not include an entity acting in a fiduciary or agency
capacity if the entity does not have the sole discretionary power to vote 20 percent of the voting securities but
hold them solely as security and have not exercised the power to vote. This restriction applies to a corporate
affiliate under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2).
Subsections (C) and (D) of paragraph (2) define affiliate also as those persons and entities whose business
or substantially all of whose property is operated under a lease or operating agreement by a debtor and whose
business or property is more than 50 percent under the control of the debtor.
The definition of "attorney" in paragraph (3) is similar to the definition of accountant.
Paragraph (4) defines "claim." The effect of the definition is a significant departure from present law. Under
present law, "claim" is not defined in straight bankruptcy. Instead it is simply used, along with the concept of
provability in section 63 of the Bankruptcy Act [section 103 of former title 11], to limit the kinds of
obligations that are payable in a bankruptcy case. The term is defined in the debtor rehabilitation chapters of
[Release Point 118-106]
present law far more broadly. The definition in paragraph (4) adopts an even broader definition of claim than
is found in the present debtor rehabilitation chapters. The definition is any right to payment, whether or not
reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured. The definition also includes as a claim an equitable right to
performance that does not give rise to a right to payment. By this broadest possible definition and by the use
of the term throughout the title 11, especially in subchapter I of chapter 5, the bill contemplates that all legal
obligations of the debtor, no matter how remote or contingent, will be able to be dealt with in the bankruptcy
case. It permits the broadest possible relief in the bankruptcy court.
Paragraph (5) defines "commodity broker" by reference to various terms used and defined in subchapter IV
of chapter 7, Commodity Broker Liquidation. The terms are described in connection with section 761, infra.
Paragraph (6) defines "community claim" for those eight States that have community property laws. The
definition is keyed to the liability of the debtor's property for a claim against either the debtor or the debtor's
spouse. If the debtor's property is liable for a claim against either, that claim is a community claim.
Paragraph (7) defines "consumer debt". The definition is adapted from the definition used in various
consumer protection laws. It encompasses only a debt incurred by an individual primarily for a personal,
family, or household purpose.
The definition of "corporation" in paragraph (8) is similar to the definition in current law, section 1(8)
[section 1(8) of former title 11]. The term encompasses any association having the power or privilege that a
private corporation, but not an individual or partnership, has; partnership associations organized under a law
that makes only the capital subscribed responsible for the debts of the partnership; joint-stock company;
unincorporated company or association; and business trust. "Unincorporated association" is intended
specifically to include a labor union, as well as other bodies that come under that phrase as used under current
law. The exclusion of limited partnerships is explicit, and not left to the case law.
Paragraph (9) defines "court" as the bankruptcy judge in the district in which the case is pending except in
municipal adjustment and railroad reorganization cases, where "court" means the Federal district judge.
Paragraph (10) [enacted as (9)] defines "creditor" to include holders of prepetition claims against the debtor.
However, it also encompasses certain holders of claims that are deemed to arise before the date of the filing of
the petition, such as those injured by the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease, certain
investment tax credit recapture claim holders, "involuntary gap" creditors, and certain holders of the right of
setoff. The term also includes the holder of a prepetition community claim. A guarantor of or surety for a
claim against the debtor is also a creditor, because he holds a contingent claim against the debtor that becomes
fixed when he pays the creditor whose claim he has guaranteed or insured.
Paragraph (11) [enacted as (10)] defines "custodian." There is no similar definition in current law. It is
defined to facilitate drafting, and means a prepetition liquidator of the debtor's property, such as an assignee
for the benefit of creditors, a receiver of the debtor's property, or administrator of the debtor's property. The
definition of custodian to include a receiver or trustee is descriptive, and not meant to be limited to court
officers with those titles. The definition is intended to include other officers of the court if their functions are
substantially similar to those of a receiver or trustee.
"Debt" is defined in paragraph (12) [enacted as (11)] as a liability on a claim. The terms "debt" and "claim"
are coextensive: a creditor has a "claim" against the debtor; the debtor owes a "debt" to the creditor. This
definition of "debt" and the definition of "claim" on which it is based, proposed 11 U.S.C. 101(4), does not
include a transaction such as a policy loan on an insurance policy. Under that kind of transaction, the debtor is
not liable to the insurance company for repayment; the amount owed is merely available to the company for
setoff against any benefits that become payable under the policy. As such, the loan is not a claim (it is not a
right to payment) that the company can assert against the estate; nor is the debtor's obligation a debt (a liability
on a claim) that will be discharged under proposed 11 U.S.C. 523 or 524.
Paragraph (13) [enacted as (12)] defines "debtor." Debtor means person or municipality concerning which a
case under title II has been commenced. This is a change in terminology from present law, which identifies the
person by or against whom a petition is filed in a straight bankruptcy liquidation case as the "bankrupt", and a
person or municipality that is proceeding under a debtor rehabilitation chapter (chapters VIII through XIII of
the Bankruptcy Act) [chapters 8 through 13 of former title 11] as a "debtor." The term "debtor" is used for
both kinds of cases in this bill, for ease of reference in chapters 1, 3, and 5 (which apply to straight bankruptcy
and reorganization cases).
Paragraph (14) [enacted as (13)] defines "disinterested person." The definition is adapted from section 158
of chapter X of current law [section 558 of former title 11], though it is expanded and modified in some
respects. A person is a disinterested person if the person is not a creditor, equity security holder, or insider; is
not and was not an investment banker of the debtor for any outstanding security of the debtor (the change
from underwriter in current law to investment banker is to make the term more descriptive and to avoid
[Release Point 118-106]
conflict with the definition of underwriter in section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77b(11));
has not been an investment banker for a security of the debtor within 3 years before the date of the filing of the
petition (the change from five years to three years here conforms the definition with the statute of limitations
in the Securities Act of 1933) [15 U.S.C. 77m], or an attorney for such an investment banker; is not an insider
of the debtor or of such an investment banker; and does not have an interest materially adverse to the estate.
"Entity" is defined, for convenience, in paragraph (15) [enacted as (14)], to include person, estate, trust, and
governmental unit. It is the most inclusive of the various defined terms relating to bodies or units.
Paragraph (16) defines "equity security." The term includes a share or stock in a corporation, a limited
partner's interest in a limited partnership, and a warrant or right to subscribe to an equity security. The term
does not include a security, such as a convertible debenture, that is convertible into equity security, but has not
been converted.
Paragraph (17) [enacted as (15)] defines "equity security holder" for convenience as the holder of an equity
securing of the debtor.
Paragraph (18) [enacted as (17)] defines "farmer". It encompasses only those persons for whom farming
operations contribute 75 percent or more of their total income.
Paragraphs (19) and (20) define "foreign proceeding" and "foreign representative". A foreign proceeding is
a proceeding in another country in which the debtor has some substantial connection for the purpose of
liquidating the estate of the debtor or the purpose of financial rehabilitation of the debtor. A foreign
representative is the representative of the estate in a foreign proceeding, such as a trustee or administrator.
Paragraph (21) defines "governmental unit" in the broadest sense. The definition encompasses the United
States, a State, Commonwealth, District, Territory, municipality, or foreign state, and a department, agency, or
instrumentality of any of those entities. "Department, agency, or instrumentality" does not include an entity
that owes its existence to State action, such as the granting of a charter or a license but that has no other
connection with a State or local government or the Federal Government. The relationship must be an active
one in which the department, agency, or instrumentality is actually carrying out some governmental function.
Paragraph (22) defines "indenture." It is similar to the definition of indenture in the Trust Indenture Act of
1939 [15 U.S.C. 77ccc(7)]. An indenture is the instrument under which securities, either debt or equity, of the
debtor are outstanding.
Paragraph (23) defines "indenture trustee" as the trustee under an indenture.
Paragraph (24) defines "individual with regular income." The effect of this definition, and of its use in
section 109(e), is to expand substantially the kinds of individuals that are eligible for relief under chapter 13,
Adjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular Income. Chapter XIII [chapter 13 of former title 11] is
now available only for wage earners. The definition encompasses all individuals with incomes that are
sufficiently stable and regular to enable them to make payments under a chapter 13 plan. Thus, individuals on
welfare, social security, fixed pension incomes, or who live on investment incomes, will be able to work out
repayment plans with their creditors rather than being forced into straight bankruptcy. Also, self-employed
individuals will be eligible to use chapter 13 if they have regular incomes.
However, the definition excludes certain stockbrokers and commodity brokers, in order to prohibit them
from proceeding under chapter 13 and avoiding the customer protection provisions of chapter 7.
"Insider", defined in paragraph (25), is a new term. An insider is one who has a sufficiently close
relationship with the debtor that his conduct is made subject to closer scrutiny than those dealing at arms
length with the debtor. If the debtor is an individual, then a relative of the debtor, a partnership in which the
debtor is a general partner, a general partner of the debtor, and a corporation controlled by the debtor are all
insiders. If the debtor is a corporation, then a controlling person, a relative of a controlling person, a
partnership in which the debtor is a general partner, and a general partner of the debtor are all insiders. If the
debtor is a partnership, then a general partner of or in the debtor, a relative of a general partner in the debtor,
and a person in control are all insiders. If the debtor is a municipality, then an elected official of the debtor is
an insider. In addition, affiliates of the debtor and managing agents are insiders.
The definition of "insolvent" in paragraph (26) is adopted from section 1(19) of current law [section 1(19)
of former title 11]. An entity is insolvent if its debts are greater than its assets, at a fair valuation, exclusive of
property exempted or fraudulently transferred. It is the traditional bankruptcy balance sheet test of insolvency.
For a partnership, the definition is modified to account for the liability of a general partner for the
partnership's debts. The difference in this definition from that in current law is in the exclusion of exempt
property for all purposes in the definition of insolvent.
Paragraph (27) defines "judicial lien." It is one of three kinds of liens defined in this section. A judicial lien
is a lien obtained by judgment, levy, sequestration, or other legal or equitable process or proceeding.
Paragraph (28) defines "lien." The definition is new and is very broad. A lien is defined as a charge against
or interest in property to secure payment of a debt or performance of an obligation. It includes inchoate liens.
[Release Point 118-106]
In general, the concept of lien is divided into three kinds of liens: judicial liens, security interests, and
statutory liens. Those three categories are mutually exclusive and are exhaustive except for certain common
law liens.
Paragraph (29) defines "municipality." The definition is adapted from the terms used in the chapter IX
(municipal bankruptcy) [chapter 9 of former title 11] amendment to the Bankruptcy Act enacted in 1976 (Pub.
L. 94–260). That amendment spoke in terms of "political subdivision or public agency or instrumentality of a
State". Bankruptcy Act Sec. 84 [section 404 of former title 11]. The term municipality is defined by those
three terms for convenience. It does not include the District of Columbia or any territories of the United
States.
"Person" is defined in paragraph (30). The definition is a change in wording, but not in substance, from the
definition in section 1(23) of the Bankruptcy Act [section 1(23) of former title 11]. The definition is also
similar to the one contained in 1 U.S.C. sec. 1, but is repeated here for convenience and ease of reference.
Person includes individual partnership, and corporation. The exclusion of governmental units is made explicit
in order to avoid any confusion that may arise if, for example, a municipality is incorporated and thus is
legally a corporation as well as governmental unit. The definition does not include an estate or a trust, which
are included only in the definition of "entity" in proposed 11 U.S.C. 101(14).
"Petition" is defined for convenience in paragraph (31). Petition is a petition under section 301, 302, 303, or
304 of the bankruptcy code—that is, a petition that commences a case under title 11.
Paragraph (32) defines purchaser as a transferee of a voluntary transfer, such as a sale or gift, and includes
an immediate or mediate transferee of a purchaser.
The definition of "railroad" in paragraph (33) is derived from section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act [section 205
of former title 11]. A railroad is a common carrier by railroad engaged in the transportation of individuals or
property, or an owner of trackage facilities leased by such a common carrier. The effect of the definition and
the use of the term in section 109(d) is to eliminate the limitation now found in section 77 of the Bankruptcy
Act that only railroads engaged in interstate commerce may proceed under the railroad reorganization
provisions. The limitation may have been inserted because of a doubt that the commerce power could not
reach intrastate railroads. Be that as it may, this bill is enacted under the bankruptcy power.
Paragraph (34) defines "relative" as an individual related by affinity or consanguinity within the third
degree as determined by the common law, and includes individuals in a step or adoptive relationship. The
definition is similar to current law, but adds the latter phrase. This definition should be applied as of the time
when the transaction that it concerns took place. Thus, a former spouse is not a relative, but if, for example,
for purposes of the preference section, proposed 11 U.S.C. 547(b)(4)(B), the transferee was a spouse of the
debtor at the time of the transfer sought to be avoided, then the transferee would be relative and subject to the
insider rules, even if the transferee was no longer married to the debtor at the time of the commencement of
the case or at the time of the commencement of the preference recovery proceeding.
Paragraph (35) defines "security." The definition is new and is modeled on the most recent draft of the
American Law Institute's proposed securities code, with some exceptions. The interest of a limited partner in a
limited partnership is included in order to make sure that everything that is defined as an equity security is
also a "security." The definition, as with the definition of "entity", "insider", and "person", is open-ended
because the term is not susceptible of precise specification. Thus the courts will be able to use the
characterization provided in this definition to treat with new kinds of documents on a flexible basis.
Paragraphs (36) and (37) defined "security agreement" and "security interest." A security interest is one of
the kinds of liens. It is a lien created by an agreement. Security agreement is defined as the agreement creating
the security interest. Though these terms are similar to the same terms in the Uniform Commercial Code,
article IX, they are broader. For example, the U.C.C. does not cover real property mortgages. Under this
definition, such a mortgage is included, as are all other liens created by agreement, even though not covered
by the U.C.C. All U.C.C. security interests and security agreements are, however, security interests and
security agreements under this definition. Whether a consignment or a lease constitutes a security interest
under the bankruptcy code will depend on whether it constitutes a security interest under applicable State or
local law.
Paragraph (38) defines another kind of lien, "statutory lien." The definition, derived from current law, states
that a statutory lien is a lien arising solely by force of statute on specified circumstances or conditions and
includes a lien of distress for rent (whether statutory, common law, or otherwise). The definition excludes
judicial liens and security interests, whether or not they are provided for or are dependent on a statute, and
whether or not they are made fully effective by statute. A statutory lien is only one that arises automatically,
and is not based on an agreement to give a lien or on judicial action. Mechanics', materialmen's, and
warehousemen's liens are examples. Tax liens are also included in the definition of statutory lien.
"Stockbroker" is defined in paragraph (39) as a person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in
[Release Point 118-106]
securities for the account of others or with members of the general public from or for such person's own
account, if the person has a customer, as defined. Thus, the definition, derived from a combination of the
definitions of "broker" and "dealer" in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c], encompasses
both brokers and dealers. The definition is used in section 109 and in subchapter III of chapter 7, Stockholder
Liquidation. The term does not encompass an employee who acts for a principal that "effects" transaction or
deals with the public, because such an employee will not have a "customer".
Paragraph (40) defines "transfer." It is derived and adapted, with stylistic changes, from section 1(30) of the
Bankruptcy Act [section 1(30) of former title 11]. A transfer is a disposition of an interest in property. The
definition of transfer is as broad as possible. Many of the potentially limiting words in current law are deleted,
and the language is simplified. Under this definition, any transfer of an interest in property is a transfer,
including a transfer of possession, custody, or control even if there is no transfer of title, because possession,
custody, and control are interests in property. A deposit in a bank account or similar account is a transfer.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 102 specifies various rules of construction but is not exclusive. Other rules of construction that are
not set out in title 11 are nevertheless intended to be followed in construing the bankruptcy code. For example,
the phrase "on request of a party in interest" or a similar phrase, is used in connection with an action that the
court may take in various sections of the Code. The phrase is intended to restrict the court from acting sua
sponte. Rules of bankruptcy procedure or court decisions will determine who is a party in interest for the
particular purposes of the provision in question, but the court will not be permitted to act on its own.
Although "property" is not construed in this section, it is used consistently throughout the code in its
broadest sense, including cash, all interests in property, such as liens, and every kind of consideration
including promises to act or forbear to act as in section 548(d).
Section 102(1) expands on a rule of construction contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and in the
Senate amendment. The phrase "after notice and a hearing", or a similar phrase, is intended to be construed
according to the particular proceeding to mean after such notice as is appropriate in the particular
circumstances, and such opportunity, if any, for a hearing as is appropriate in the particular circumstances. If a
provision of title 11 authorizes an act to be taken "after notice and a hearing" this means that if appropriate
[Release Point 118-106]
notice is given and no party to whom such notice is sent timely requests a hearing, then the act sought to be
taken may be taken without an actual hearing.
In very limited emergency circumstances, there will be insufficient time for a hearing to be commenced
before an action must be taken. The action sought to be taken may be taken if authorized by the court at an ex
parte hearing of which a record is made in open court. A full hearing after the fact will be available in such an
instance.
In some circumstances, such as under section 1128, the bill requires a hearing and the court may act only
after a hearing is held. In those circumstances the judge will receive evidence before ruling. In other
circumstances, the court may take action "after notice and a hearing," if no party in interest requests a hearing.
In that event a court order authorizing the action to be taken is not necessary as the ultimate action taken by
the court implies such an authorization.
Section 102(8) is new. It contains a rule of construction indicating that a definition contained in a section in
title 11 that refers to another section of title 11 does not, for the purposes of such reference, take the meaning
of a term used in the other section. For example, section 522(a)(2) defines "value" for the purposes of section
522. Section 548(d)(2) defines "value" for purposes of section 548. When section 548 is incorporated by
reference in section 522, this rule of construction makes clear that the definition of "value" in section 548
governs its meaning in section 522 notwithstanding a different definition of "value" in section 522(a)(2).
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 102 provides seven rules of construction. Some are derived from current law; others are derived
from 1 U.S.C. 1; a few are new. They apply generally throughout proposed title 11. These are terms that are
not appropriate for definition, but that require an explanation.
Paragraph (1) defines the concept of "after notice and a hearing." The concept is central to the bill and to
the separation of the administrative and judicial functions of bankruptcy judges. The phrase means after such
notice as is appropriate in the particular circumstances (to be prescribed by either the Rules of Bankruptcy
Procedure or by the court in individual circumstances that the Rules do not cover. In many cases, the Rules
will provide for combined notice of several proceedings), and such opportunity for a hearing as is appropriate
in the particular circumstances. Thus, a hearing will not be necessary in every instance. If there is no objection
to the proposed action, the action may go ahead without court action. This is a significant change from present
law, which requires the affirmative approval of the bankruptcy judge for almost every action. The change will
permit the bankruptcy judge to stay removed from the administration of the bankruptcy or reorganization case,
and to become involved only when there is a dispute about a proposed action, that is, only when there is an
objection. The phrase "such opportunity for a hearing as is appropriate in the particular circumstances" is
designed to permit the Rules and the courts to expedite or dispense with hearings when speed is essential. The
language "or similar phrase" is intended to cover the few instances in the bill where "after notice and a
hearing" is interrupted by another phrase, such as "after notice to the debtor and a hearing."
Paragraph (2) specifies that "claim against the debtor" includes claim against property of the debtor. This
paragraph is intended to cover nonrecourse loan agreements where the creditor's only rights are against
property of the debtor, and not against the debtor personally. Thus, such an agreement would give rise to a
claim that would be treated as a claim against the debtor personally, for the purposes of the bankruptcy code.
Paragraph (3) is a codification of American Surety Co. v. Marotta, 287 U.S. 513 (1933). It specifies that
"includes" and "including" are not limiting.
Paragraph (4) specifies that "may not" is prohibitive and not permissive (such as in "might not").
Paragraph (5) specifies that "or" is not exclusive. Thus, if a party "may do (a) or (b)", then the party may do
either or both. The party is not limited to a mutually exclusive choice between the two alternatives.
Paragraph (6) makes clear that "order for relief" means entry of an order for relief. If the court orally orders
relief, but the order is not entered until a later time, then any time measurements in the bill are from entry, not
from the oral order. In a voluntary case, the entry of the order for relief is the filing of the petition
commencing the voluntary case.
Paragraph (7) specifies that the singular includes the plural. The plural, however, generally does not include
the singular. The bill uses only the singular, even when the item in question most often is found in plural
quantities, in order to avoid the confusion possible if both rules of construction applied. When an item is
specified in the plural, the plural is intended.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 104 represents a compromise between the House bill and the Senate amendment with respect to the
adjustment of dollar amounts in title 11. The House amendment authorizes the Judicial Conference of the
United States to transmit a recommendation for the uniform percentage of adjustment for each dollar amount
in title 11 and in 28 U.S.C. 1930 to the Congress and to the President before May 1, 1985, and before May 1
of every sixth year thereafter. The requirement in the House bill that each such recommendation be based only
on any change in the cost-of-living increase during the period immediately preceding the recommendation is
deleted.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section requires that the Director of the Administrative Office of the U. S. Courts report to Congress
and the President before Oct. 1, 1985, and before May 1 every 6 years thereafter a recommendation for
adjustment in dollar amounts found in this title. The Committee feels that regular adjustment of the dollar
amounts by the Director will conserve congressional time and yet assure that the relative dollar amounts used
in the bill are maintained. Changes in the cost of living should be a significant, but not necessarily the only,
factor considered by the Director. The fact that there has been an increase in the cost of living does not
necessarily mean that an adjustment of dollar amounts would be needed or warranted.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
This section requires the Judicial Conference to report to the Congress every four years after the effective
date of the bankruptcy code any changes that have occurred in the cost of living during the preceding four
years, and the appropriate adjustments to the dollar amounts in the bill. The dollar amounts are found
primarily in the exemption section (11 U.S.C. 522), the wage priority (11 U.S.C. 507), and the eligibility for
chapter 13 (11 U.S.C. 109). This section requires that the Conference recommend uniform percentage changes
in these amounts based solely on cost of living changes. The dollar amounts in the bill would not change on
that recommendation, absent Congressional veto. Instead, Congress is required to take affirmative action, by
passing a law amending the appropriate section, if it wishes to accomplish the change.
If the Judicial Conference has policy recommendations concerning the appropriate dollar amounts in the
bankruptcy code based other than on cost of living considerations there are adequate channels through which
it may communicate its views. This section is solely for the housekeeping function of maintaining the dollar
amounts in the code at fairly constant real dollar levels.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 105 is derived from section 2a (15) of present law [section 11(a)(15) of former title 11], with two
changes. First, the limitation on the power of a bankruptcy judge (the power to enjoin a court being reserved
to the district judge) is removed as inconsistent with the increased powers and jurisdiction of the new
[Release Point 118-106]
bankruptcy court. Second, the bankruptcy judge is prohibited from appointing a receiver in a case under title
11 under any circumstances. The bankruptcy code has ample provision for the appointment of a trustee when
needed. Appointment of a receiver would simply circumvent the established procedures.
This section is also an authorization, as required under 28 U.S.C. 2283, for a court of the United States to
stay the action of a State court. As such, Toucey v. New York Life Insurance Company, 314 U.S. 118 (1941), is
overruled.

(1) Sections 105, 106, 107, 108, 303, 346, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 502, 503, 505, 506, 510,

(2) The court may hear and determine any issue arising with respect to the application of such
sections to governmental units.
(3) The court may issue against a governmental unit an order, process, or judgment under such
sections or the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, including an order or judgment awarding a
money recovery, but not including an award of punitive damages. Such order or judgment for
costs or fees under this title or the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure against any
governmental unit shall be consistent with the provisions and limitations of section 2412(d)(2)(A)
of title 28.
(4) The enforcement of any such order, process, or judgment against any governmental unit
shall be consistent with appropriate nonbankruptcy law applicable to such governmental unit and,
in the case of a money judgment against the United States, shall be paid as if it is a judgment
rendered by a district court of the United States.
(5) Nothing in this section shall create any substantive claim for relief or cause of action not
otherwise existing under this title, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, or nonbankruptcy
law.
(b) A governmental unit that has filed a proof of claim in the case is deemed to have waived
sovereign immunity with respect to a claim against such governmental unit that is property of the
estate and that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence out of which the claim of such
governmental unit arose.
(c) Notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity by a governmental unit, there shall be
offset against a claim or interest of a governmental unit any claim against such governmental unit
that is property of the estate.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 106(c) relating to sovereign immunity is new. The provision indicates that the use of the term
"creditor," "entity," or "governmental unit" in title 11 applies to governmental units notwithstanding any
assertion of sovereign immunity and that an order of the court binds governmental units. The provision is
included to comply with the requirement in case law that an express waiver of sovereign immunity is required
in order to be effective. Section 106(c) codifies In re Gwilliam, 519 F.2d 407 (9th Cir., 1975), and In re
Dolard, 519 F.2d 282 (9th Cir., 1975), permitting the bankruptcy court to determine the amount and
dischargeability of tax liabilities owing by the debtor or the estate prior to or during a bankruptcy case whether
or not the governmental unit to which such taxes are owed files a proof of claim. Except as provided in
sections 106(a) and (b), subsection (c) is not limited to those issues, but permits the bankruptcy court to bind
governmental units on other matters as well. For example, section 106(c) permits a trustee or debtor in
possession to assert avoiding powers under title 11 against a governmental unit; contrary language in the
House report to H.R. 8200 is thereby overruled.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 106 provides for a limited waiver of sovereign immunity in bankruptcy cases. Though Congress has
the power to waive sovereign immunity for the Federal government completely in bankruptcy cases, the
policy followed here is designed to achieve approximately the same result that would prevail outside of
bankruptcy. Congress does not, however, have the power to waive sovereign immunity completely with
respect to claims of a bankrupt estate against a State, though it may exercise its bankruptcy power through the
supremacy clause to prevent or prohibit State action that is contrary to bankruptcy policy.
There is, however, a limited change from the result that would prevail in the absence of bankruptcy; the
change is two-fold and is within Congress' power vis-a-vis both the Federal Government and the States. First,
the filing of a proof of claim against the estate by a governmental unit is a waiver by that governmental unit of
sovereign immunity with respect to compulsory counterclaims, as defined in the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure [title 28, appendix], that is, counterclaims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence. The
governmental unit cannot receive a distribution from the estate without subjecting itself to any liability it has
[Release Point 118-106]
to the estate within the confines of a compulsory counterclaim rule. Any other result would be one-sided. The
counterclaim by the estate against the governmental unit is without limit.
Second, the estate may offset against the allowed claim of a governmental unit, up to the amount of the
governmental unit's claim, any claim that the debtor, and thus the estate, has against the governmental unit,
without regard to whether the estate's claim arose out of the same transaction or occurrence as the
government's claim. Under this provision, the setoff permitted is only to the extent of the governmental unit's
claim. No affirmative recovery is permitted. Subsection (a) governs affirmative recovery.
Though this subsection creates a partial waiver of immunity when the governmental unit files a proof of
claim, it does not waive immunity if the debtor or trustee, and not the governmental unit, files proof of a
governmental unit's claim under proposed 11 U.S.C. 501(c).
This section does not confer sovereign immunity on any governmental unit that does not already have
immunity. It simply recognizes any immunity that exists and prescribes the proper treatment of claims by and
against that sovereign.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Extension of time: The House amendment adopts section 108(c)(1) of the Senate amendment which
expressly includes any special suspensions of statutes of limitation periods on collection outside bankruptcy
when assets are under the authority of a court. For example, section 6503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code
[title 26] suspends collection of tax liabilities while the debtor's assets are in the control or custody of a court,
and for 6 months thereafter. By adopting the language of the Senate amendment, the House amendment
insures not only that the period for collection of the taxes outside bankruptcy will not expire during the title 11
proceedings, but also that such period will not expire until at least 6 months thereafter, which is the minimum
suspension period provided by the Internal Revenue Code [title 26].
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsections (a) and (b), derived from Bankruptcy Act section 11 [section 29 of former title 11], permit the
trustee, when he steps into the shoes of the debtor, an extension of time for filing an action or doing some
other act that is required to preserve the debtor's rights. Subsection (a) extends any statute of limitation for
commencing or continuing an action by the debtor for two years after the date of the order for relief, unless it
would expire later. Subsection (b) gives the trustee 60 days to take other actions not covered under subsection
(a), such as filing a pleading, demand, notice, or proof of claim or loss (such as an insurance claim), unless the
period for doing the relevant act expires later than 60 days after the date of the order for relief.
Subsection (c) extends the statute of limitations for creditors. Thus, if a creditor is stayed from commencing
or continuing an action against the debtor because of the bankruptcy case, then the creditor is permitted an
additional 30 days after notice of the event by which the stay is terminated, whether that event be relief from
the automatic stay under proposed 11 U.S.C. 362 or 1301, the closing of the bankruptcy case (which
terminates the stay), or the exception from discharge of the debts on which the creditor claims.
In the case of Federal tax liabilities, the Internal Revenue Code [title 26] suspends the statute of limitations
on a tax liability of a taxpayer from running while his assets are in the control or custody of a court and for 6
months thereafter (sec. 6503(b) of the Code [title 26]). The amendment applies this rule in a title 11
proceeding. Accordingly, the statute of limitations on collection of a nondischargeable Federal tax liability of
a debtor will resume running after 6 months following the end of the period during which the debtor's assets
are in the control or custody of the bankruptcy court. This rule will provide the Internal Revenue Service
adequate time to collect nondischargeable taxes following the end of the title 11 proceedings.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 109(b) of the House amendment adopts a provision contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House.
Railroad liquidations will occur under chapter 11, not chapter 7.
Section 109(c) contains a provision which tracks the Senate amendment as to when a municipality may be a
debtor under chapter 11 of title 11. As under the Bankruptcy Act [former title 11], State law authorization and
prepetition negotiation efforts are required.
Section 109(e) represents a compromise between H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate
amendment relating to the dollar amounts restricting eligibility to be a debtor under chapter 13 of title 11. The
House amendment adheres to the limit of $100,000 placed on unsecured debts in H.R. 8200 as passed by the
House. It adopts a midpoint of $350,000 as a limit on secured claims, a compromise between the level of
$500,000 in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and $200,000 as contained in the Senate amendment.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section specifies eligibility to be a debtor under the bankruptcy laws. The first criterion, found in the
current Bankruptcy Act section 2a(1) [section 11(a)(1) of former title 11] requires that the debtor reside or
have a domicile, a place of business, or property in the United States.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subsection (b) defines eligibility for liquidation under chapter 7. All persons are eligible except insurance
companies, and certain banking institutions. These exclusions are contained in current law. However, the
banking institution exception is expanded in light of changes in various banking laws since the current law
was last amended on this point. A change is also made to clarify that the bankruptcy laws cover foreign banks
and insurance companies not engaged in the banking or insurance business in the United States but having
assets in the United States. Banking institutions and insurance companies engaged in business in this country
are excluded from liquidation under the bankruptcy laws because they are bodies for which alternate provision
is made for their liquidation under various State or Federal regulatory laws. Conversely, when a foreign bank
or insurance company is not engaged in the banking or insurance business in the United States, then those
regulatory laws do not apply, and the bankruptcy laws are the only ones available for administration of any
assets found in United States.
The first clause of subsection (b) provides that a railroad is not a debtor except where the requirements of
section 1174 are met.
Subsection (c) [enacted as (d)] provides that only a person who may be a debtor under chapter 7 and a
railroad may also be a debtor under chapter 11, but a stockbroker or commodity broker is eligible for relief
only under chapter 7. Subsection (d) [enacted as (e)] establishes dollar limitations on the amount of
indebtedness that an individual with regular income can incur and yet file under chapter 13.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (c) defines eligibility for chapter 9. Only a municipality that is unable to pay its debts as they
mature, and that is not prohibited by State law from proceeding under chapter 9, is permitted to be a chapter 9
debtor. The subsection is derived from Bankruptcy Act §84 [section 404 of former title 11], with two changes.
First, section 84 requires that the municipality be "generally authorized to file a petition under this chapter by
the legislature, or by a governmental officer or organization empowered by State law to authorize the filing of
a petition." The "generally authorized" language is unclear, and has generated a problem for a Colorado
Metropolitan District that attempted to use chapter IX [chapter 9 of former title 11] in 1976. The "not
prohibited" language provides flexibility for both the States and the municipalities involved, while protecting
State sovereignty as required by Ashton v. Cameron County Water District No. 1, 298 U.S. 513 (1936) [56
S.Ct. 892, 80 L.Ed. 1309, 31 Am.Bankr.Rep.N.S. 96, rehearing denied 57 S.Ct. 5, 299 U.S. 619, 81 L.Ed. 457]
and Bekins v. United States, 304 U.S. 27 (1938) [58 S.Ct. 811, 82 L.Ed. 1137, 36 Am.Bankr.Rep.N.S. 187,
rehearing denied 58 S.Ct. 1043, 1044, 304 U.S. 589, 82 L.Ed. 1549].
The second change deletes the four prerequisites to filing found in section 84 [section 404 of former title
11]. The prerequisites require the municipality to have worked out a plan in advance, to have attempted to
work out a plan without success, to fear that a creditor will attempt to obtain a preference, or to allege that
prior negotiation is impracticable. The loopholes in those prerequisites are larger than the requirement itself. It
was a compromise from pre-1976 chapter IX [chapter 9 of former title 11] under which a municipality could
file only if it had worked out an adjustment plan in advance. In the meantime, chapter IX protection was
unavailable. There was some controversy at the time of the enactment of current chapter IX concerning
deletion of the pre-negotiation requirement. It was argued that deletion would lead to a rash of municipal
bankruptcies. The prerequisites now contained in section 84 were inserted to assuage that fear. They are
largely cosmetic and precatory, however, and do not offer any significant deterrent to use of chapter IX.
Instead, other factors, such as a general reluctance on the part of any debtor, especially a municipality, to use
the bankruptcy laws, operates as a much more effective deterrent against capricious use.
Subsection (d) permits a person that may proceed under chapter 7 to be a debtor under chapter 11,
Reorganization, with two exceptions. Railroads, which are excluded from chapter 7, are permitted to proceed
under chapter 11. Stockbrokers and commodity brokers, which are permitted to be debtors under chapter 7,
are excluded from chapter 11. The special rules for treatment of customer accounts that are the essence of
stockbroker and commodity broker liquidations are available only in chapter 7. Customers would be
unprotected under chapter 11. The special protective rules are unavailable in chapter 11 because their
complexity would make reorganization very difficult at best, and unintelligible at worst. The variety of
options available in reorganization cases make it extremely difficult to reorganize and continue to provide the
special customer protection necessary in these cases.
Subsection (e) specifies eligibility for chapter 13, Adjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular
Income. An individual with regular income, or an individual with regular income and the individual's spouse,
may proceed under chapter 13. As noted in connection with the definition of the term "individual with regular
income", this represents a significant departure from current law. The change might have been too great,
however, without some limitation. Thus, the debtor (or the debtor and spouse) must have unsecured debts that
aggregate less than $100,000, and secured debts that aggregate less than $500,000. These figures will permit
[Release Point 118-106]
the small sole proprietor, for whom a chapter 11 reorganization is too cumbersome a procedure, to proceed
under chapter 13. It does not create a presumption that any sole proprietor within that range is better off in
chapter 13 than chapter 11. The conversion rules found in section 1307 will govern the appropriateness of the
two chapters for any particular individual. The figures merely set maximum limits.
Whether a small business operated by a husband and wife, the so-called "mom and pop grocery store," will
be a partnership and thus excluded from chapter 13, or a business owned by an individual, will have to be
determined on the facts of each case. Even if partnership papers have not been filed, for example, the issue
will be whether the assets of the grocery store are for the benefit of all creditors of the debtor or only for
business creditors, and whether such assets may be the subject of a chapter 13 proceeding. The intent of the
section is to follow current law that a partnership by estoppel may be adjudicated in bankruptcy and therefore
would not prevent a chapter 13 debtor from subjecting assets in such a partnership to the reach of all creditors
in a chapter 13 case. However, if the partnership is found to be a partnership by agreement, even informal
agreement, than a separate entity exists and the assets of that entity would be exempt from a case under
chapter 13.

LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Sections 301, 302, 303, and 304 are all modified in the House amendment to adopt an idea contained in
sections 301 and 303 of the Senate amendment requiring a petition commencing a case to be filed with the
bankruptcy court. The exception contained in section 301 of the Senate bill relating to cases filed under
chapter 9 is deleted. Chapter 9 cases will be handled by a bankruptcy court as are other title 11 cases.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 301 specifies the manner in which a voluntary bankruptcy case is commenced. The debtor files a
petition under this section under the particular operative chapter of the bankruptcy code under which he
wishes to proceed. The filing of the petition constitutes an order for relief in the case under that chapter. The
section contains no change from current law, except for the use of the phrase "order for relief" instead of
"adjudication." The term adjudication is replaced by a less pejorative phrase in light of the clear power of
Congress to permit voluntary bankruptcy without the necessity for an adjudication, as under the 1898 act
[former title 11], which was adopted when voluntary bankruptcy was a concept not thoroughly tested.

§302. Joint cases
(a) A joint case under a chapter of this title is commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court
of a single petition under such chapter by an individual that may be a debtor under such chapter and
such individual's spouse. The commencement of a joint case under a chapter of this title constitutes
an order for relief under such chapter.
(b) After the commencement of a joint case, the court shall determine the extent, if any, to which
the debtors' estates shall be consolidated.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2558.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
A joint case is a voluntary bankruptcy case concerning a wife and husband. Under current law, there is no
explicit provision for joint cases. Very often, however, in the consumer debtor context, a husband and wife are
jointly liable on their debts, and jointly hold most of their property. A joint case will facilitate consolidation of
their estates, to the benefit of both the debtors and their creditors, because the cost of administration will be
reduced, and there will be only one filing fee.
Section 302 specifies that a joint case is commenced by the filing of a petition under an appropriate chapter
by an individual and that individual's spouse. Thus, one spouse cannot take the other into bankruptcy without
the other's knowledge or consent. The filing of the petition constitutes an order for relief under the chapter
selected.
Subsection (b) requires the court to determine the extent, if any, to which the estates of the two debtors will
be consolidated; that is, assets and liabilities combined in a single pool to pay creditors. Factors that will be
relevant in the court's determination include the extent of jointly held property and the amount of
[Release Point 118-106]
jointly-owned debts. The section, of course, is not license to consolidate in order to avoid other provisions of
the title to the detriment of either the debtors or their creditors. It is designed mainly for ease of
administration.
§303. Involuntary cases
(a) An involuntary case may be commenced only under chapter 7 or 11 of this title, and only
against a person, except a farmer, family farmer, or a corporation that is not a moneyed, business, or
commercial corporation, that may be a debtor under the chapter under which such case is
commenced.
(b) An involuntary case against a person is commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court of
a petition under chapter 7 or 11 of this title—
(1) by three or more entities, each of which is either a holder of a claim against such person that
is not contingent as to liability or the subject of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount, or an
indenture trustee representing such a holder, if such noncontingent, undisputed claims aggregate at
least $10,000 1 more than the value of any lien on property of the debtor securing such claims held
by the holders of such claims;
(2) if there are fewer than 12 such holders, excluding any employee or insider of such person
and any transferee of a transfer that is voidable under section 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, or 724(a) of
this title, by one or more of such holders that hold in the aggregate at least $10,000 1 of such
claims;
(3) if such person is a partnership—
(A) by fewer than all of the general partners in such partnership; or
(B) if relief has been ordered under this title with respect to all of the general partners in such
partnership, by a general partner in such partnership, the trustee of such a general partner, or a
holder of a claim against such partnership; or
(4) by a foreign representative of the estate in a foreign proceeding concerning such person.
(c) After the filing of a petition under this section but before the case is dismissed or relief is
ordered, a creditor holding an unsecured claim that is not contingent, other than a creditor filing
under subsection (b) of this section, may join in the petition with the same effect as if such joining
creditor were a petitioning creditor under subsection (b) of this section.
(d) The debtor, or a general partner in a partnership debtor that did not join in the petition, may file
an answer to a petition under this section.
(e) After notice and a hearing, and for cause, the court may require the petitioners under this
section to file a bond to indemnify the debtor for such amounts as the court may later allow under
subsection (i) of this section.
(f) Notwithstanding section 363 of this title, except to the extent that the court orders otherwise,
and until an order for relief in the case, any business of the debtor may continue to operate, and the
debtor may continue to use, acquire, or dispose of property as if an involuntary case concerning the
debtor had not been commenced.
(g) At any time after the commencement of an involuntary case under chapter 7 of this title but
before an order for relief in the case, the court, on request of a party in interest, after notice to the
debtor and a hearing, and if necessary to preserve the property of the estate or to prevent loss to the
estate, may order the United States trustee to appoint an interim trustee under section 701 of this title
to take possession of the property of the estate and to operate any business of the debtor. Before an
order for relief, the debtor may regain possession of property in the possession of a trustee ordered
appointed under this subsection if the debtor files such bond as the court requires, conditioned on the
debtor's accounting for and delivering to the trustee, if there is an order for relief in the case, such
property, or the value, as of the date the debtor regains possession, of such property.
(h) If the petition is not timely controverted, the court shall order relief against the debtor in an
involuntary case under the chapter under which the petition was filed. Otherwise, after trial, the court
[Release Point 118-106]
shall order relief against the debtor in an involuntary case under the chapter under which the petition
was filed, only if—
(1) the debtor is generally not paying such debtor's debts as such debts become due unless such
debts are the subject of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount; or
(2) within 120 days before the date of the filing of the petition, a custodian, other than a trustee,
receiver, or agent appointed or authorized to take charge of less than substantially all of the
property of the debtor for the purpose of enforcing a lien against such property, was appointed or
took possession.
(i) If the court dismisses a petition under this section other than on consent of all petitioners and
the debtor, and if the debtor does not waive the right to judgment under this subsection, the court
may grant judgment—
(1) against the petitioners and in favor of the debtor for—
(A) costs; or
(B) a reasonable attorney's fee; or
(2) against any petitioner that filed the petition in bad faith, for—
(A) any damages proximately caused by such filing; or
(B) punitive damages.
(j) Only after notice to all creditors and a hearing may the court dismiss a petition filed under this
section—
(1) on the motion of a petitioner;
(2) on consent of all petitioners and the debtor; or
(3) for want of prosecution.
(k)(1) If—
(A) the petition under this section is false or contains any materially false, fictitious, or
fraudulent statement;
(B) the debtor is an individual; and
(C) the court dismisses such petition,
the court, upon the motion of the debtor, shall seal all the records of the court relating to such
petition, and all references to such petition.
(2) If the debtor is an individual and the court dismisses a petition under this section, the court
may enter an order prohibiting all consumer reporting agencies (as defined in section 603(f) of the
Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f))) from making any consumer report (as defined in
section 603(d) of that Act) that contains any information relating to such petition or to the case
commenced by the filing of such petition.
(3) Upon the expiration of the statute of limitations described in section 3282 of title 18, for a
violation of section 152 or 157 of such title, the court, upon the motion of the debtor and for good
cause, may expunge any records relating to a petition filed under this section.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 303(b)(1) is modified to make clear that unsecured claims against the debtor must be determined by
taking into account liens securing property held by third parties.
Section 303(b)(3) adopts a provision contained in the Senate amendment indicating that an involuntary
[Release Point 118-106]
petition may be commenced against a partnership by fewer than all of the general partners in such partnership.
Such action may be taken by fewer than all of the general partners notwithstanding a contrary agreement
between the partners or State or local law.
Section 303(h)(1) in the House amendment is a compromise of standards found in H.R. 8200 as passed by
the House and the Senate amendment pertaining to the standards that must be met in order to obtain an order
for relief in an involuntary case under title 11. The language specifies that the court will order such relief only
if the debtor is generally not paying debtor's debts as they become due.
Section 303(h)(2) reflects a compromise pertaining to section 543 of title 11 relating to turnover of property
by a custodian. It provides an alternative test to support an order for relief in an involuntary case. If a
custodian, other than a trustee, receiver, or agent appointed or authorized to take charge of less than
substantially all of the property of the debtor for the purpose of enforcing a lien against such property, was
appointed or took possession within 120 days before the date of the filing of the petition, then the court may
order relief in the involuntary case. The test under section 303(h)(2) differs from section 3a(5) of the
Bankruptcy Act [section 21(a)(5) of former title 11], which requires an involuntary case to be commenced
before the earlier of time such custodian was appointed or took possession. The test in section 303(h)(2)
authorizes an order for relief to be entered in an involuntary case from the later date on which the custodian
was appointed or took possession.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 303 governs the commencement of involuntary cases under title 11. An involuntary case may be
commenced only under chapter 7, Liquidation, or chapter 11, Reorganization. Involuntary cases are not
permitted for municipalities, because to do so may constitute an invasion of State sovereignty contrary to the
10th amendment, and would constitute bad policy, by permitting the fate of a municipality, governed by
officials elected by the people of the municipality, to be determined by a small number of creditors of the
municipality. Involuntary chapter 13 cases are not permitted either. To do so would constitute bad policy,
because chapter 13 only works when there is a willing debtor that wants to repay his creditors. Short of
involuntary servitude, it is difficult to keep a debtor working for his creditors when he does not want to pay
them back. See chapter 3, supra.
The exceptions contained in current law that prohibit involuntary cases against farmers, ranchers and
eleemosynary institutions are continued. Farmers and ranchers are excepted because of the cyclical nature of
their business. One drought year or one year of low prices, as a result of which a farmer is temporarily unable
to pay his creditors, should not subject him to involuntary bankruptcy. Eleemosynary institutions, such as
churches, schools, and charitable organizations and foundations, likewise are exempt from involuntary
bankruptcy.
The provisions for involuntary chapter 11 cases is a slight change from present law, based on the proposed
consolidation of the reorganization chapters. Currently, involuntary cases are permitted under chapters X and
XII [chapters 10 and 12 of former title 11] but not under chapter XI [chapter 11 of former title 11]. The
consolidation requires a single rule for all kinds of reorganization proceedings. Because the assets of an
insolvent debtor belong equitably to his creditors, the bill permits involuntary cases in order that creditors may
realize on their assets through reorganization as well as through liquidation.
Subsection (b) of the section specifies who may file an involuntary petition. As under current law, if the
debtor has more than 12 creditors, three creditors must join in the involuntary petition. The dollar amount
limitation is changed from current law to $5,000. The new amount applies both to liquidation and
reorganization cases in order that there not be an artificial difference between the two chapters that would
provide an incentive for one or the other. Subsection (b)(1) makes explicit the right of an indenture trustee to
be one of the three petitioning creditors on behalf of the creditors the trustee represents under the indenture. If
all of the general partners in a partnership are in bankruptcy, then the trustee of a single general partner may
file an involuntary petition against the partnership. Finally, a foreign representative may file an involuntary
case concerning the debtor in the foreign proceeding, in order to administer assets in this country. This
subsection is not intended to overrule Bankruptcy Rule 104(d), which places certain restrictions on the transfer
of claims for the purpose of commencing an involuntary case. That Rule will be continued under section
405(d) of this bill.
Subsection (c) permits creditors other than the original petitioning creditors to join in the petition with the
same effect as if the joining creditor had been one of the original petitioning creditors. Thus, if the claim of
one of the original petitioning creditors is disallowed, the case will not be dismissed for want of three creditors
or want of $5,000 in petitioning claims if the joining creditor suffices to fulfill the statutory requirements.
Subsection (d) permits the debtor to file an answer to an involuntary petition. The subsection also permits a
general partner in a partnership debtor to answer an involuntary petition against the partnership if he did not
[Release Point 118-106]
join in the petition. Thus, a partnership petition by less than all of the general partners is treated as an
involuntary, not a voluntary, petition.
The court may, under subsection (e), require the petitioners to file a bond to indemnify the debtor for such
amounts as the court may later allow under subsection (i). Subsection (i) provides for costs, attorneys fees, and
damages in certain circumstances. The bonding requirement will discourage frivolous petitions as well as
spiteful petitions based on a desire to embarrass the debtor (who may be a competitor of a petitioning creditor)
or to put the debtor out of business without good cause. An involuntary petition may put a debtor out of
business even if it is without foundation and is later dismissed.
Subsection (f) is both a clarification and a change from existing law. It permits the debtor to continue to
operate any business of the debtor and to dispose of property as if the case had not been commenced. The
court is permitted, however, to control the debtor's powers under this subsection by appropriate orders, such as
where there is a fear that the debtor may attempt to abscond with assets, dispose of them at less than their fair
value, or dismantle his business, all to the detriment of the debtor's creditors.
The court may also, under subsection (g), appoint an interim trustee to take possession of the debtor's
property and to operate any business of the debtor, pending trial on the involuntary petition. The court may
make such an order only on the request of a party in interest, and after notice to the debtor and a hearing.
There must be a showing that a trustee is necessary to preserve the property of the estate or to prevent loss to
the estate. The debtor may regain possession by posting a sufficient bond.
Subsection (h) provides the standard for an order for relief on an involuntary petition. If the petition is not
timely controverted (the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure will fix time limits), the court orders relief after a
trial, only if the debtor is generally unable to pay its debts as they mature, or if the debtor has failed to pay a
major portion of his debts as they become due, or if a custodian was appointed during the 90-day period
preceding the filing of the petition. The first two tests are variations of the equity insolvency test. They
represent the most significant departure from present law concerning the grounds for involuntary bankruptcy,
which requires an act of bankruptcy. Proof of the commission of an act of bankruptcy has frequently required
a showing that the debtor was insolvent on a "balance-sheet" test when the act was committed. This bill
abolishes the concept of acts of bankruptcy.
The equity insolvency test has been in equity jurisprudence for hundreds of years, and though it is new in
the bankruptcy context (except in chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11]), the bankruptcy courts should have
no difficulty in applying it. The third test, appointment of a custodian within ninety days before the petition, is
provided for simplicity. It is not a partial re-enactment of acts of bankruptcy. If a custodian of all or
substantially all of the property of the debtor has been appointed, this paragraph creates an irrebuttable
presumption that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as they mature. Moreover, once a proceeding to liquidate
assets has been commenced, the debtor's creditors have an absolute right to have the liquidation (or
reorganization) proceed in the bankruptcy court and under the bankruptcy laws with all of the appropriate
creditor and debtor protections that those laws provide. Ninety days gives creditors ample time in which to
seek bankruptcy liquidation after the appointment of a custodian. If they wait beyond the ninety day period,
they are not precluded from filing an involuntary petition. They are simply required to prove equity
insolvency rather than the more easily provable custodian test.
Subsection (i) permits the court to award costs, reasonable attorney's fees, or damages if an involuntary
petition is dismissed other than by consent of all petitioning creditors and the debtor. The damages that the
court may award are those that may be caused by the taking of possession of the debtor's property under
subsection (g) or section 1104 of the bankruptcy code. In addition, if a petitioning creditor filed the petition in
bad faith, the court may award the debtor any damages proximately caused by the filing of the petition. These
damages may include such items as loss of business during and after the pendency of the case, and so on. "Or"
is not exclusive in this paragraph. The court may grant any or all of the damages provided for under the
provision. Dismissal in the best interests of credits under section 305(a)(1) would not give rise to a damages
claim.
Under subsection (j), the court may dismiss the petition by consent only after giving notice to all creditors.
The purpose of the subsection is to prevent collusive settlements among the debtor and the petitioning
creditors while other creditors, that wish to see relief ordered with respect to the debtor but that did not
participate in the case, are left without sufficient protection.
Subsection (k) governs involuntary cases against foreign banks that are not engaged in business in the
United States but that have assets located here. The subsection prevents a foreign bank from being placed into
bankruptcy in this country unless a foreign proceeding against the bank is pending. The special protection
afforded by this section is needed to prevent creditors from effectively closing down a foreign bank by the
[Release Point 118-106]
commencement of an involuntary bankruptcy case in this country unless that bank is involved in a proceeding
under foreign law. An involuntary case commenced under this subsection gives the foreign representative an
alternative to commencing a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding under section 304.

SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
A principle of the common law requires a court with jurisdiction over a particular matter to take
jurisdiction. This section recognizes that there are cases in which it would be appropriate for the court to
decline jurisdiction. Abstention under this section, however, is of jurisdiction over the entire case. Abstention
from jurisdiction over a particular proceeding in a case is governed by proposed 28 U.S.C. 1471(c). Thus, the
court is permitted, if the interests of creditors and the debtor would be better served by dismissal of the case or
suspension of all proceedings in the case, to so order. The court may dismiss or suspend under the first
paragraph, for example, if an arrangement is being worked out by creditors and the debtor out of court, there is
no prejudice to the results of creditors in that arrangement, and an involuntary case has been commenced by a
few recalcitrant creditors to provide a basis for future threats to extract full payment. The less expensive
out-of-court workout may better serve the interests in the case. Likewise, if there is pending a foreign
proceeding concerning the debtor and the factors specified in proposed 11 U.S.C. 304(c) warrant dismissal or
suspension, the court may so act.
Subsection (b) gives a foreign representative authority to appear in the bankruptcy court to request
dismissal or suspension. Subsection (c) makes the dismissal or suspension order nonreviewable by appeal or
otherwise. The bankruptcy court, based on its experience and discretion is vested with the power of decision.

ancillary case or that is appearing in connection with a petition under section 303 or 304 to appear without
subjecting himself to the jurisdiction of any other court in the United States, including State courts. The
protection is necessary to allow the foreign representative to present his case and the case of the foreign estate,
without waiving the normal jurisdictional rules of the foreign country. That is, creditors in this country will
still have to seek redress against the foreign estate according to the host country's jurisdictional rules. Any
other result would permit local creditors to obtain unfair advantage by filing an involuntary case, thus
requiring the foreign representative to appear, and then obtaining local jurisdiction over the representative in
connection with his appearance in this country. That kind of bankruptcy law would legalize an ambush
technique that has frequently been rejected by the common law in other contexts.
However, the bankruptcy court is permitted under section 306 to condition any relief under section 303,
304, or 305 on the compliance by the foreign representative with the orders of the bankruptcy court. The last
provision is not carte blanche to the bankruptcy court to require the foreign representative to submit to
jurisdiction in other courts contrary to the general policy of the section. It is designed to enable the bankruptcy
court to enforce its own orders that are necessary to the appropriate relief granted under section 303, 304, or
305.

A trustee qualifies in a case by filing, within five days after selection, a bond in favor of the United States,
conditioned on the faithful performance of his official duties. This section is derived from the Bankruptcy Act
section 50b [section 78(b) of former title 11]. The court is required to determine the amount of the bond and
the sufficiency of the surety on the bond. Subsection (c), derived from Bankruptcy Act section 50i [section
78(i) of former title 11], relieves the trustee from personal liability and from liability on his bond for any
penalty or forfeiture incurred by the debtor. Subsection (d), derived from section 50m [section 78(m) of
former title 11], fixes a two-year statute of limitations on any action on a trustee's bond. Finally, subsection (e)
dispenses with the bonding requirement for the United States trustee.

may allow reasonable compensation under section 330 of this title of the trustee for the trustee's
services, payable after the trustee renders such services, not to exceed 25 percent on the first $5,000
or less, 10 percent on any amount in excess of $5,000 but not in excess of $50,000, 5 percent on any
amount in excess of $50,000 but not in excess of $1,000,000, and reasonable compensation not to
exceed 3 percent of such moneys in excess of $1,000,000, upon all moneys disbursed or turned over
in the case by the trustee to parties in interest, excluding the debtor, but including holders of secured
claims.
(b) In a case under subchapter V of chapter 11 or chapter 12 or 13 of this title, the court may not
allow compensation for services or reimbursement of expenses of the United States trustee or of a

under section 330 of this title of a trustee appointed under section 1202(a) or 1302(a) of this title for
the trustee's services, payable after the trustee renders such services, not to exceed five percent upon
all payments under the plan.
(c) If more than one person serves as trustee in the case, the aggregate compensation of such
persons for such service may not exceed the maximum compensation prescribed for a single trustee
by subsection (a) or (b) of this section, as the case may be.
(d) The court may deny allowance of compensation for services or reimbursement of expenses of
the trustee if the trustee failed to make diligent inquiry into facts that would permit denial of

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 326(a) of the House amendment modifies a provision as contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the
House. The percentage limitation on the fees of a trustee contained in the House bill is retained, but no
additional percentage is specified for cases in which a trustee operates the business of the debtor. Section
326(b) of the Senate amendment is deleted as an unnecessary restatement of the limitation contained in section
326(a) as modified. The provision contained in section 326(a) of the Senate amendment authorizing a trustee
to receive a maximum fee of $150 regardless of the availability of assets in the estate is deleted. It will not be
necessary in view of the increase in section 326(a) and the doubling of the minimum fee as provided in section
330(b).
Section 326(b) of the House amendment derives from section 326(c) of H.R. 8200 as passed by the House.
It is a conforming amendment to indicate a change with respect to the selection of a trustee in a chapter 13
case under section 1302(a) of title 11.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section is derived in part from section 48c of the Bankruptcy Act [section 76(c) of former title 11]. It
must be emphasized that this section does not authorize compensation of trustees. This section simply fixes
the maximum compensation of a trustee. Proposed 11 U.S.C. 330 authorizes and fixes the standard of
[Release Point 118-106]
compensation. Under section 48c of current law, the maximum limits have tended to become minimums in
many cases. This section is not intended to be so interpreted. The limits in this section, together with the
limitations found in section 330, are to be applied as outer limits, and not as grants or entitlements to the
maximum fees specified.
The maximum fee schedule is derived from section 48c(1) of the present act [section 76(c)(1) of former title
11], but with a change relating to the bases on which the percentage maxima are computed. The maximum fee
schedule is based on decreasing percentages of increasing amounts. The amounts are the amounts of money
distributed by the trustee to parties in interest, excluding the debtor, but including secured creditors. These
amounts were last amended in 1952. Since then, the cost of living has approximately doubled. Thus, the bases
were doubled.
It should be noted that the bases on which the maximum fee is computed includes moneys turned over to
secured creditors, to cover the situation where the trustee liquidates property subject to a lien and distributes
the proceeds. It does not cover cases in which the trustee simply turns over the property to the secured
creditor, nor where the trustee abandons the property and the secured creditor is permitted to foreclose. The
provision is also subject to the rights of the secured creditor generally under proposed section 506, especially
506(c). The $150 discretionary fee provision of current law is retained.
Subsection (b) of this section entitles an operating trustee to a reasonable fee, without any limitation based
on the maximum provided for a liquidating trustee as in current law, Bankruptcy Act §48c(2) [section 76(c)(2)
of former title 11].
Subsection (c) [enacted as (b)] permits a maximum fee of five percent on all payments to creditors under a
chapter 13 plan to the trustee appointed in the case.
Subsection (d) [enacted as (c)] provides a limitation not found in current law. Even if more than one trustee
serves in the case, the maximum fee payable to all trustees does not change. For example, if an interim trustee
is appointed and an elected trustee replaces him, the combined total of the fees payable to the interim trustee
and the permanent trustee may not exceed the amount specified in this section. Under current law, very often a
receiver receives a full fee and a subsequent trustee also receives a full fee. The resultant "double-dipping",
especially in cases in which the receiver and the trustee are the same individual, is detrimental to the interests
of creditors, by needlessly increasing the cost of administering bankruptcy estates.
Subsection (e) [enacted as (d)] permits the court to deny compensation to a trustee if the trustee has been
derelict in his duty by employing counsel, who is not disinterested.

LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 327(a) of the House amendment contains a technical amendment indicating that attorneys, and
perhaps other officers enumerated therein, represent, rather than assist, the trustee in carrying out the trustee's
duties.
Section 327(c) represents a compromise between H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate
amendment. The provision states that former representation of a creditor, whether secured or unsecured, will
not automatically disqualify a person from being employed by a trustee, but if such person is employed by the
trustee, the person may no longer represent the creditor in connection with the case.
Section 327(f) prevents an examiner from being employed by the trustee.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section authorizes the trustee, subject to the court's approval, to employ professional persons, such as
attorneys, accountants, appraisers, and auctioneers, to represent or perform services for the estate. The trustee
may employ only disinterested persons that do not hold or represent an interest adverse to the estate.
Subsection (b) is an exception, and authorizes the trustee to retain or replace professional persons that the
debtor has employed if necessary in the operation of the debtor's business.
Subsection (c) provides a professional person is not disqualified for employment solely because of the
person's prior employment by or representation of a secured or unsecured creditor.
Subsection (d) permits the court to authorize the trustee, if qualified to act as his own counsel or accountant.
Subsection (e) permits the trustee, subject to the court's approval, to employ for a specified special purpose
an attorney that has represented the debtor, if such employment is in the best interest of the estate and if the
attorney does not hold or represent an interest adverse to the debtor of the estate with respect to the matter on
which he is to be employed. This subsection does not authorize the employment of the debtor's attorney to
represent the estate generally or to represent the trustee in the conduct of the bankruptcy case. The subsection
will most likely be used when the debtor is involved in complex litigation, and changing attorneys in the
middle of the case after the bankruptcy case has commenced would be detrimental to the progress of that other
litigation.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (c) is an additional exception. The trustee may employ as his counsel a nondisinterested person
if the only reason that the attorney is not disinterested is because of his representation of an unsecured
creditor.

§328. Limitation on compensation of professional persons
(a) The trustee, or a committee appointed under section 1102 of this title, with the court's approval,
may employ or authorize the employment of a professional person under section 327 or 1103 of this
title, as the case may be, on any reasonable terms and conditions of employment, including on a
retainer, on an hourly basis, on a fixed or percentage fee basis, or on a contingent fee basis.
Notwithstanding such terms and conditions, the court may allow compensation different from the
compensation provided under such terms and conditions after the conclusion of such employment, if
such terms and conditions prove to have been improvident in light of developments not capable of
being anticipated at the time of the fixing of such terms and conditions.
(b) If the court has authorized a trustee to serve as an attorney or accountant for the estate under
section 327(d) of this title, the court may allow compensation for the trustee's services as such
attorney or accountant only to the extent that the trustee performed services as attorney or accountant
for the estate and not for performance of any of the trustee's duties that are generally performed by a
trustee without the assistance of an attorney or accountant for the estate.
(c) Except as provided in section 327(c), 327(e), or 1107(b) of this title, the court may deny
allowance of compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses of a professional person
employed under section 327 or 1103 of this title if, at any time during such professional person's
employment under section 327 or 1103 of this title, such professional person is not a disinterested
person, or represents or holds an interest adverse to the interest of the estate with respect to the
matter on which such professional person is employed.

LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 328(c) adopts a technical amendment contained in the Senate amendment indicating that an
attorney for the debtor in possession is not disqualified for compensation for services and reimbursement of
expenses simply because of prior representation of the debtor.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section, which is parallel to section 326, fixes the maximum compensation allowable to a professional
person employed under section 327. It authorizes the trustee, with the court's approval, to employ professional
persons on any reasonable terms, including on a retainer, on an hourly or on a contingent fee basis. Subsection
(a) further permits the court to allow compensation different from the compensation provided under the
trustee's agreement if the prior agreement proves to have been improvident in light of development
unanticipatable at the time of the agreement. The court's power includes the power to increase as well as
decrease the agreed upon compensation. This provision is permissive, not mandatory, and should not be used
by the court if to do so would violate the code of ethics of the professional involved.
Subsection (b) limits a trustee that has been authorized to serve as his own counsel to only one fee for each
service. The purpose of permitting the trustee to serve as his own counsel is to reduce costs. It is not included
to provide the trustee with a bonus by permitting him to receive two fees for the same service or to avoid the
maxima fixed in section 326. Thus, this subsection requires the court to differentiate between the trustee's
services as trustee, and his services as trustee's counsel, and to fix compensation accordingly. Services that a
trustee normally performs for an estate without assistance of counsel are to be compensated under the limits
fixed in section 326. Only services that he performs that are normally performed by trustee's counsel may be
compensated under the maxima imposed by this section.
Subsection (c) permits the court to deny compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses if the
professional person is not disinterested or if he represents or holds an interest adverse to the estate on the
matter on which he is employed. The subsection provides a penalty for conflicts of interest.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section, derived in large part from current Bankruptcy Act section 60d [section 96(d) of former title
11], requires the debtor's attorney to file with the court a statement of the compensation paid or agreed to be
paid to the attorney for services in contemplation of and in connection with the case, and the source of the
compensation. Payments to a debtor's attorney provide serious potential for evasion of creditor protection
provisions of the bankruptcy laws, and serious potential for overreaching by the debtor's attorney, and should
be subject to careful scrutiny.
Subsection (b) permits the court to deny compensation to the attorney, to cancel an agreement to pay
compensation, or to order the return of compensation paid, if the compensation exceeds the reasonable value
of the services provided. The return of payments already made are generally to the trustee for the benefit of
the estate. However, if the property would not have come into the estate in any event, the court will order it
returned to the entity that made the payment.
The Bankruptcy Commission recommended a provision similar to this that would have also permitted an
examination of the debtor's transactions with insiders. S. 236, 94th Cong., 1st sess., sec. 4–311(b) (1975). Its
exclusion here is to permit it to be dealt with by the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. It is not intended that the
provision be deleted entirely, only that the flexibility of the rules is more appropriate for such evidentiary
matters.

(2) The court may, on its own motion or on the motion of the United States Trustee, the United

(3) In determining the amount of reasonable compensation to be awarded to an examiner, trustee
under chapter 11, or professional person, the court shall consider the nature, the extent, and the value
of such services, taking into account all relevant factors, including—
(A) the time spent on such services;
(B) the rates charged for such services;
(C) whether the services were necessary to the administration of, or beneficial at the time at

(6) Any compensation awarded for the preparation of a fee application shall be based on the level
and skill reasonably required to prepare the application.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 330(a) contains the standard of compensation adopted in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House rather
than the contrary standard contained in the Senate amendment. Attorneys' fees in bankruptcy cases can be
quite large and should be closely examined by the court. However bankruptcy legal services are entitled to
command the same competency of counsel as other cases. In that light, the policy of this section is to
compensate attorneys and other professionals serving in a case under title 11 at the same rate as the attorney or
other professional would be compensated for performing comparable services other than in a case under title
11. Contrary language in the Senate report accompanying S. 2266 is rejected, and Massachusetts Mutual Life
Insurance Company v. Brock, 405 F.2d 429, 432 (5th Cir. 1968) is overruled. Notions of economy of the
estate in fixing fees are outdated and have no place in a bankruptcy code.
Section 330(a)(2) of the Senate amendment is deleted although the Securities and Exchange Commission
retains a right to file an advisory report under section 1109.
Section 330(b) of the Senate amendment is deleted as unnecessary, as the limitations contained therein are
covered by section 328(c) of H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and contained in the House amendment.
Section 330(c) of the Senate amendment providing for a trustee to receive a fee of $20 for each estate from
the filing fee paid to the clerk is retained as section 330(b) of the House amendment. The section will
encourage private trustees to serve in cases under title 11 and in pilot districts will place less of a burden on
the U.S. trustee to serve in no-asset cases.
Section 330(b) of H.R. 8200 as passed by the House is retained by the House amendment as section 330(c)
[section 15330].
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 330 authorizes the court to award compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses of
officers of the estate, and other professionals. The compensation is to be reasonable, for economy in
administration is the basic objective. Compensation is to be for actual necessary services, based on the time
spent, the nature, the extent and the value of the services rendered, and the cost of comparable services in
nonbankruptcy cases. There are the criteria that have been applied by the courts as analytic aids in defining
"reasonable" compensation.
The reference to "the cost of comparable services" in a nonbankruptcy case is not intended as a change of
existing law. In a bankruptcy case fees are not a matter for private agreement. There is inherent a "public
interest" that "must be considered in awarding fees," Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Brock, 405
F.2d 429, 432 (C.A.5, 1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 906 (1969). An allowance is the result of a balance struck
between moderation in the interest of the estate and its security holders and the need to be "generous enough
to encourage" lawyers and others to render the necessary and exacting services that bankruptcy cases often
require. In re Yale Express System, Inc., 366 F.Supp. 1376, 1381 (S.D.N.Y. 1973). The rates for similar kinds
of services in private employment is one element, among others, in that balance. Compensation in private
employment noted in subsection (a) is a point of reference, not a controlling determinant of what shall be
allowed in bankruptcy cases.
One of the major reforms in 1938, especially for reorganization cases, was centralized control over fees in
the bankruptcy courts. See Brown v. Gerdes, 321 U.S. 178, 182–184 (1944); Leiman v. Guttman, 336 U.S. 1,
4–9 (1949). It was intended to guard against a recurrence of "the many sordid chapters" in "the history of fees
in corporate reorganizations." Dickinson Industrial Site, Inc. v. Cowan, 309 U.S. 382, 388 (1940). In the years
since then the bankruptcy bar has flourished and prospered, and persons of merit and quality have not
eschewed public service in bankruptcy cases merely because bankruptcy courts, in the interest of economy in
administration, have not allowed them compensation that may be earned in the private economy of business or
the professions. There is no reason to believe that, in generations to come, their successors will be less
persuaded by the need to serve in the public interest because of stronger allures of private gain elsewhere.
Subsection (a) provides for compensation of paraprofessionals in order to reduce the cost of administering
bankruptcy cases. Paraprofessionals can be employed to perform duties which do not require the full range of
skills of a qualified professional. Some courts have not hesitated to recognize paraprofessional services as
compensable under existing law. An explicit provision to that effect is useful and constructive.
The last sentence of subsection (a) provides that in the case of a public company—defined in section
1101(3)—the court shall refer, after a hearing, all applications to the Securities and Exchange Commission for
[Release Point 118-106]
a report, which shall be advisory only. In Chapter X cases in which the Commission has appeared, it generally
filed reports on fee applications. Usually, courts have accorded the SEC's views substantial weight, as
representing the opinion of a disinterested agency skilled and experienced in reorganization affairs. The last
sentence intends for the advisory assistance of the Commission to be sought only in case of a public company
in reorganization under chapter 11.
Subsection (b) reenacts section 249 of Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act ([former] 11 U.S.C. 649). It is a
codification of equitable principles designed to prevent fiduciaries in the case from engaging in the specified
transactions since they are in a position to gain inside information or to shape or influence the course of the
reorganization. Wolf v. Weinstein, 372 U.S. 633 (1963). The statutory bar of compensation and reimbursement
is based on the principle that such transactions involve conflicts of interest. Private gain undoubtedly prompts
the purchase or sale of claims or stock interests, while the fiduciary's obligation is to render loyal and
disinterested service which his position of trust has imposed upon him. Subsection (b) extends to a trustee, his
attorney, committees and their attorneys, or any other persons "acting in the case in a representative or
fiduciary capacity." It bars compensation to any of the foregoing, who after assuming to act in such capacity
has purchased or sold, directly or indirectly, claims against, or stock in the debtor. The bar is absolute. It
makes no difference whether the transaction brought a gain or loss, or neither, and the court is not authorized
to approve a purchase or sale, before or after the transaction. The exception is for an acquisition or transfer
"otherwise" than by a voluntary purchase or sale, such as an acquisition by bequest. See Otis & Co. v.
Insurance Bldg. Corp., 110 F.2d 333, 335 (C.A.1, 1940).
Subsection (c) [enacted as (b)] is intended for no asset liquidation cases where minimal compensation for
trustees is needed. The sum of $20 will be allowed in each case, which is double the amount provided under
current law.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Section 330 authorizes compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses of officers of the estate. It
also prescribes the standards on which the amount of compensation is to be determined. As noted above, the
compensation allowable under this section is subject to the maxima set out in sections 326, 328, and 329. The
compensation is to be reasonable, for actual necessary services rendered, based on the time, the nature, the
extent, and the value of the services rendered, and on the cost of comparable services other than in a case
under the bankruptcy code. The effect of the last provision is to overrule In re Beverly Crest Convalescent
Hospital, Inc., 548 F.2d 817 (9th Cir. 1976, as amended 1977), which set an arbitrary limit on fees payable
based on the amount of a district judge's salary, and other, similar cases that require fees to be determined
based on notions of conservation of the estate and economy of administration. If that case were allowed to
stand, attorneys that could earn much higher incomes in other fields would leave the bankruptcy arena.
Bankruptcy specialists, who enable the system to operate smoothly, efficiently, and expeditiously, would be
driven elsewhere, and the bankruptcy field would be occupied by those who could not find other work and
those who practice bankruptcy law only occasionally almost as a public service. Bankruptcy fees that are
lower than fees in other areas of the legal profession may operate properly when the attorneys appearing in
bankruptcy cases do so intermittently, because a low fee in a small segment of a practice can be absorbed by
other work. Bankruptcy specialists, however, if required to accept fees in all of their cases that are consistently
lower than fees they could receive elsewhere, will not remain in the bankruptcy field.
This subsection provides for reimbursement of actual, necessary expenses. It further provides for
compensation of paraprofessionals employed by professional persons employed by the estate of the debtor.
The provision is included to reduce the cost of administering bankruptcy cases. In nonbankruptcy areas,
attorneys are able to charge for a paraprofessional's time on an hourly basis, and not include it in overhead. If
a similar practice does not pertain in bankruptcy cases then the attorney will be less inclined to use
paraprofessionals even where the work involved could easily be handled by an attorney's assistant, at much
lower cost to the estate. This provision is designed to encourage attorneys to use paraprofessional assistance
where possible, and to insure that the estate, not the attorney, will bear the cost, to the benefit of both the
estate and the attorneys involved.

in a case under this title, or more often if the court permits, for such compensation for services
rendered before the date of such an application or reimbursement for expenses incurred before such
date as is provided under section 330 of this title. After notice and a hearing, the court may allow and
disburse to such applicant such compensation or reimbursement.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2564.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 331 permits trustees and professional persons to apply to the court not more than once every 120
days for interim compensation and reimbursement payments. The court may permit more frequent
applications if the circumstances warrant, such as in very large cases where the legal work is extensive and
merits more frequent payments. The court is authorized to allow and order disbursement to the applicant of
compensation and reimbursement that is otherwise allowable under section 330. The only effect of this section
is to remove any doubt that officers of the estate may apply for, and the court may approve, compensation and
reimbursement during the case, instead of being required to wait until the end of the case, which in some
instances, may be years. The practice of interim compensation is followed in some courts today, but has been
subject to some question. This section explicitly authorizes it.
This section will apply to professionals such as auctioneers and appraisers only if they are not paid on a per
job basis.
§332. Consumer privacy ombudsman
(a) If a hearing is required under section 363(b)(1)(B), the court shall order the United States
trustee to appoint, not later than 7 days before the commencement of the hearing, 1 disinterested
person (other than the United States trustee) to serve as the consumer privacy ombudsman in the case
and shall require that notice of such hearing be timely given to such ombudsman.
(b) The consumer privacy ombudsman may appear and be heard at such hearing and shall provide
to the court information to assist the court in its consideration of the facts, circumstances, and
conditions of the proposed sale or lease of personally identifiable information under section
363(b)(1)(B). Such information may include presentation of—
(1) the debtor's privacy policy;
(2) the potential losses or gains of privacy to consumers if such sale or such lease is approved
by the court;
[Release Point 118-106]
(3) the potential costs or benefits to consumers if such sale or such lease is approved by the
court; and
(4) the potential alternatives that would mitigate potential privacy losses or potential costs to
consumers.
(c) A consumer privacy ombudsman shall not disclose any personally identifiable information
obtained by the ombudsman under this title.

§333. Appointment of patient care ombudsman
(a)(1) If the debtor in a case under chapter 7, 9, or 11 is a health care business, the court shall
order, not later than 30 days after the commencement of the case, the appointment of an ombudsman
to monitor the quality of patient care and to represent the interests of the patients of the health care
business unless the court finds that the appointment of such ombudsman is not necessary for the
protection of patients under the specific facts of the case.
(2)(A) If the court orders the appointment of an ombudsman under paragraph (1), the United
States trustee shall appoint 1 disinterested person (other than the United States trustee) to serve as
such ombudsman.
(B) If the debtor is a health care business that provides long-term care, then the United States
trustee may appoint the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman appointed under the Older Americans
Act of 1965 for the State in which the case is pending to serve as the ombudsman required by
paragraph (1).
(C) If the United States trustee does not appoint a State Long-Term Care Ombudsman under
subparagraph (B), the court shall notify the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman appointed under the
Older Americans Act of 1965 for the State in which the case is pending, of the name and address of
the person who is appointed under subparagraph (A).
(b) An ombudsman appointed under subsection (a) shall—
(1) monitor the quality of patient care provided to patients of the debtor, to the extent necessary
under the circumstances, including interviewing patients and physicians;
(2) not later than 60 days after the date of appointment, and not less frequently than at 60-day
intervals thereafter, report to the court after notice to the parties in interest, at a hearing or in
writing, regarding the quality of patient care provided to patients of the debtor; and
(3) if such ombudsman determines that the quality of patient care provided to patients of the
debtor is declining significantly or is otherwise being materially compromised, file with the court
a motion or a written report, with notice to the parties in interest immediately upon making such
[Release Point 118-106]
determination.
(c)(1) An ombudsman appointed under subsection (a) shall maintain any information obtained by
such ombudsman under this section that relates to patients (including information relating to patient
records) as confidential information. Such ombudsman may not review confidential patient records
unless the court approves such review in advance and imposes restrictions on such ombudsman to
protect the confidentiality of such records.
(2) An ombudsman appointed under subsection (a)(2)(B) shall have access to patient records
consistent with authority of such ombudsman under the Older Americans Act of 1965 and under
non-Federal laws governing the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman program.

(b) The United States trustee may convene a meeting of any equity security holders.
(c) The court may not preside at, and may not attend, any meeting under this section including any

otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law, or any other requirement that representation at the meeting
of creditors under subsection (a) be by an attorney, a creditor holding a consumer debt or any
representative of the creditor (which may include an entity or an employee of an entity and may be a
representative for more than 1 creditor) shall be permitted to appear at and participate in the meeting
of creditors in a case under chapter 7 or 13, either alone or in conjunction with an attorney for the
creditor. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require any creditor to be represented by an
attorney at any meeting of creditors.
(d) Prior to the conclusion of the meeting of creditors or equity security holders, the trustee shall
orally examine the debtor to ensure that the debtor in a case under chapter 7 of this title is aware of—
(1) the potential consequences of seeking a discharge in bankruptcy, including the effects on
credit history;
(2) the debtor's ability to file a petition under a different chapter of this title;
(3) the effect of receiving a discharge of debts under this title; and

LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 341(c) of the Senate amendment is deleted and a contrary provision is added indicating that the
bankruptcy judge will not preside at or attend the first meeting of creditors or equity security holders but a
discharge hearing for all individuals will be held at which the judge will preside.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section [Subsection] (a) of this section requires that there be a meeting of creditors within a reasonable time
after the order for relief in the case. The Bankruptcy Act [former title 11] and the current Rules of Bankruptcy
Procedure provide for a meeting of creditors, and specify the time and manner of the meeting, and the
business to be conducted. This bill leaves those matters to the rules. Under section 405(d) of the bill, the
present rules will continue to govern until new rules are promulgated. Thus, pending the adoption of different
rules, the present procedure for the meeting will continue.
Subsection (b) authorizes the court to order a meeting of equity security holders in cases where such a
meeting would be beneficial or useful, for example, in a chapter 11 reorganization case where it may be
necessary for the equity security holders to organize in order to be able to participate in the negotiation of a
plan of reorganization.
Subsection (c) makes clear that the bankruptcy judge is to preside at the meeting of creditors.

presumption of abuse arises under section 707(b), the clerk shall give written notice to all creditors
not later than 10 days after the date of the filing of the petition that the presumption of abuse has
arisen.
(e)(1) In a case under chapter 7 or 13 of this title of a debtor who is an individual, a creditor at any
time may both file with the court and serve on the debtor a notice of address to be used to provide
notice in such case to such creditor.
(2) Any notice in such case required to be provided to such creditor by the debtor or the court later
than 7 days after the court and the debtor receive such creditor's notice of address, shall be provided
to such address.
(f)(1) An entity may file with any bankruptcy court a notice of address to be used by all the
bankruptcy courts or by particular bankruptcy courts, as so specified by such entity at the time such
notice is filed, to provide notice to such entity in all cases under chapters 7 and 13 pending in the
courts with respect to which such notice is filed, in which such entity is a creditor.
(2) In any case filed under chapter 7 or 13, any notice required to be provided by a court with
respect to which a notice is filed under paragraph (1), to such entity later than 30 days after the filing
of such notice under paragraph (1) shall be provided to such address unless with respect to a
particular case a different address is specified in a notice filed and served in accordance with
subsection (e).
(3) A notice filed under paragraph (1) may be withdrawn by such entity.
(g)(1) Notice provided to a creditor by the debtor or the court other than in accordance with this
section (excluding this subsection) shall not be effective notice until such notice is brought to the
attention of such creditor. If such creditor designates a person or an organizational subdivision of
such creditor to be responsible for receiving notices under this title and establishes reasonable
procedures so that such notices receivable by such creditor are to be delivered to such person or such
subdivision, then a notice provided to such creditor other than in accordance with this section
(excluding this subsection) shall not be considered to have been brought to the attention of such
creditor until such notice is received by such person or such subdivision.
(2) A monetary penalty may not be imposed on a creditor for a violation of a stay in effect under
section 362(a) (including a monetary penalty imposed under section 362(k)) or for failure to comply
with section 542 or 543 unless the conduct that is the basis of such violation or of such failure occurs
after such creditor receives notice effective under this section of the order for relief.

LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 342(b) and (c) of the Senate amendment are adopted in principle but moved to section 549(c), in
lieu of section 342(b) of H.R. 8200 as passed by the House.
Section 342(c) of H.R. 8200 as passed by the House is deleted as a matter to be left to the Rules of
Bankruptcy Procedure.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) of section 342 requires the clerk of the bankruptcy court to give notice of the order for relief.
The rules will prescribe to whom the notice should be sent and in what manner notice will be given. The rules
already prescribe such things, and they will continue to govern unless changed as provided in section 404(a)
of the bill. Due process will certainly require notice to all creditors and equity security holders. State and
Federal governmental representatives responsible for collecting taxes will also receive notice. In cases where
the debtor is subject to regulation, the regulatory agency with jurisdiction will receive notice. In order to
[Release Point 118-106]
insure maximum notice to all parties in interest, the Rules will include notice by publication in appropriate
cases and for appropriate issues. Other notices will be given as appropriate.
Subsections (b) and (c) [enacted as section 549(c)] are derived from section 21g of the Bankruptcy Act
[section 44(g) of former title 11]. They specify that the trustee may file notice of the commencement of the
case in land recording offices in order to give notice of the pendency of the case to potential transferees of the
debtor's real property. Such filing is unnecessary in the county in which the bankruptcy case is commenced. If
notice is properly filed, a subsequent purchaser of the property will not be a bona fide purchaser. Otherwise, a
purchaser, including a purchaser at a judicial sale, that has no knowledge of the case, is not prevented from
obtaining the status of a bona fide purchaser by the mere commencement of the case. "County" is defined in
title 1 of the United States Code to include other political subdivisions where counties are not used.

SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section, derived from section 21a of the Bankruptcy Act [section 44(a) of former title 11], requires the
debtor to appear at the meeting of creditors and submit to examination under oath. The purpose of the
examination is to enable creditors and the trustee to determine if assets have improperly been disposed of or
concealed or if there are grounds for objection to discharge. The scope of the examination under this section
will be governed by the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, as it is today. See rules 205(d), 10–213(c), and
11–26. It is expected that the scope prescribed by these rules for liquidation cases, that is, "only the debtor's
acts, conduct, or property, or any matter that may affect the administration of the estate, or the debtor's right to
discharge" will remain substantially unchanged. In reorganization cases, the examination would be broader,
including inquiry into the liabilities and financial condition of the debtor, the operation of his business, and the
desirability of the continuance thereof, and other matters relevant to the case and to the formulation of the
plan. Examination of other persons in connection with the bankruptcy case is left completely to the rules, just
as examination of witnesses in civil cases is governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

§344. Self-incrimination; immunity
Immunity for persons required to submit to examination, to testify, or to provide information in a
case under this title may be granted under part V of title 18.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2565.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
[Release Point 118-106]
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Part V [§6001 et seq.] of title 18 of the United States Code governs the granting of immunity to witnesses
before Federal tribunals. The immunity provided under part V is only use immunity, not transactional
immunity. Part V applies to all proceedings before Federal courts, before Federal grand juries, before
administrative agencies, and before Congressional committees. It requires the Attorney General or the U. S.
attorney to request or to approve any grant of immunity, whether before a court, grand jury, agency, or
congressional committee.
This section carries part V over into bankruptcy cases. Thus, for a witness to be ordered to testify before a
bankruptcy court in spite of a claim of privilege, the U. S. attorney for the district in which the court sits
would have to request from the district court for that district the immunity order. The rule would apply to both
debtors, creditors, and any other witnesses in a bankruptcy case. If the immunity were granted, the witness
would be required to testify. If not, he could claim the privilege against self-incrimination.
Part V is a significant departure from current law. Under section 7a(10) of the Bankruptcy Act [section
25(a)(10) of former title 11], a debtor is required to testify in all circumstances, but any testimony he gives
may not be used against him in any criminal proceeding, except testimony given in any hearing on objections
to discharge. With that exception, section 7a(10) amounts to a blanket grant of use immunity to all debtors.
Immunity for other witnesses in bankruptcy courts today is governed by part V of title 18.
The consequences of a claim of privileges by a debtor under proposed law and under current law differ as
well. Under section 14c(6) of current law [section 32(c)(6) of former title 11], any refusal to answer a material
question approved by the court will result in the denial of a discharge, even if the refusal is based on the
privilege against self incrimination. Thus, the debtor is confronted with the choice between losing his
discharge and opening himself up to possible criminal prosecution.
Under section 727(a)(6) of the proposed title 11, a debtor is only denied a discharge if he refuses to testify
after having been granted immunity. If the debtor claims the privilege and the U. S. attorney does not request
immunity from the district courts, then the debtor may refuse to testify and still retain his right to a discharge.
It removes the Scylla and Charibdis choice for debtors that exists under the Bankruptcy Act [former title 11].
§345. Money of estates
(a) A trustee in a case under this title may make such deposit or investment of the money of the
estate for which such trustee serves as will yield the maximum reasonable net return on such money,
taking into account the safety of such deposit or investment.
(b) Except with respect to a deposit or investment that is insured or guaranteed by the United
States or by a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States, the trustee shall require from an entity with which such money is
deposited or invested—
(1) a bond—
(A) in favor of the United States;
(B) secured by the undertaking of a corporate surety approved by the United States trustee for
the district in which the case is pending; and
(C) conditioned on—
(i) a proper accounting for all money so deposited or invested and for any return on such
money;
(ii) prompt repayment of such money and return; and
(iii) faithful performance of duties as a depository; or
(2) the deposit of securities of the kind specified in section 9303 of title 31;
unless the court for cause orders otherwise.
(c) An entity with which such moneys are deposited or invested is authorized to deposit or invest
such moneys as may be required under this section.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
The House amendment moves section 345(c) of the House bill to chapter 15 as part of the pilot program for
the U.S. trustees. The bond required by section 345(b) may be a blanket bond posted by the financial
depository sufficient to cover deposits by trustees in several cases, as is done under current law.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section is a significant departure from section 61 of the Bankruptcy Act [section 101 of former title
11]. It permits a trustee in a bankruptcy case to make such deposit of investment of the money of the estate for
which he serves as will yield the maximum reasonable net return on the money, taking into account the safety
of such deposit or investment. Under current law, the trustee is permitted to deposit money only with banking
institutions. Thus, the trustee is generally unable to secure a high rate of return on money of estates pending
distribution, to the detriment of creditors. Under this section, the trustee may make deposits in savings and
loans, may purchase government bonds, or make such other deposit or investment as is appropriate. Under
proposed 11 U.S.C. 541(a)(6), and except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, any interest or gain
realized on the deposit or investment of funds under this section will become property of the estate, and will
thus enhance the recovery of creditors.
In order to protect the creditors, subsection (b) requires certain precautions against loss of the money so
deposited or invested. The trustee must require from a person with which he deposits or invests money of an
estate a bond in favor of the United States secured by approved corporate surety and conditioned on a proper
accounting for all money deposited or invested and for any return on such money. Alternately, the trustee may
require the deposit of securities of the kind specified in section 15 of title 6 of the United States Code [31
U.S.C. 9303], which governs the posting of security by banks that receive public moneys on deposit. These
bonding requirements do not apply to deposits or investments that are insured or guaranteed the United States
or a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States, or that are backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States.
These provisions do not address the question of aggregation of funds by a private chapter 13 trustee and are
not to be construed as excluding such possibility. The Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure may provide for
aggregation under appropriate circumstances and adequate safeguards in cases where there is a significant
need, such as in districts in which there is a standing chapter 13 trustee. In such case, the interest or return on
the funds would help defray the cost of administering the cases in which the standing trustee serves.

§346. Special provisions related to the treatment of State and local taxes
(a) Whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides that a separate taxable estate or entity
is created in a case concerning a debtor under this title, and the income, gain, loss, deductions, and
credits of such estate shall be taxed to or claimed by the estate, a separate taxable estate is also
created for purposes of any State and local law imposing a tax on or measured by income and such
income, gain, loss, deductions, and credits shall be taxed to or claimed by the estate and may not be
taxed to or claimed by the debtor. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the case is dismissed.
The trustee shall make tax returns of income required under any such State or local law.
(b) Whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides that no separate taxable estate shall be
created in a case concerning a debtor under this title, and the income, gain, loss, deductions, and
credits of an estate shall be taxed to or claimed by the debtor, such income, gain, loss, deductions,
and credits shall be taxed to or claimed by the debtor under a State or local law imposing a tax on or
measured by income and may not be taxed to or claimed by the estate. The trustee shall make such
tax returns of income of corporations and of partnerships as are required under any State or local
law, but with respect to partnerships, shall make such returns only to the extent such returns are also
required to be made under such Code. The estate shall be liable for any tax imposed on such
corporation or partnership, but not for any tax imposed on partners or members.
(c) With respect to a partnership or any entity treated as a partnership under a State or local law
imposing a tax on or measured by income that is a debtor in a case under this title, any gain or loss
resulting from a distribution of property from such partnership, or any distributive share of any
income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partner or member that is distributed, or considered
distributed, from such partnership, after the commencement of the case, is gain, loss, income,
deduction, or credit, as the case may be, of the partner or member, and if such partner or member is a
debtor in a case under this title, shall be subject to tax in accordance with subsection (a) or (b).
(d) For purposes of any State or local law imposing a tax on or measured by income, the taxable
period of a debtor in a case under this title shall terminate only if and to the extent that the taxable
period of such debtor terminates under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
(e) The estate in any case described in subsection (a) shall use the same accounting method as the
debtor used immediately before the commencement of the case, if such method of accounting
complies with applicable nonbankruptcy tax law.
(f) For purposes of any State or local law imposing a tax on or measured by income, a transfer of
property from the debtor to the estate or from the estate to the debtor shall not be treated as a
disposition for purposes of any provision assigning tax consequences to a disposition, except to the
extent that such transfer is treated as a disposition under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
(g) Whenever a tax is imposed pursuant to a State or local law imposing a tax on or measured by
income pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), such tax shall be imposed at rates generally applicable to
the same types of entities under such State or local law.
(h) The trustee shall withhold from any payment of claims for wages, salaries, commissions,
dividends, interest, or other payments, or collect, any amount required to be withheld or collected
under applicable State or local tax law, and shall pay such withheld or collected amount to the
appropriate governmental unit at the time and in the manner required by such tax law, and with the
same priority as the claim from which such amount was withheld or collected was paid.
(i)(1) To the extent that any State or local law imposing a tax on or measured by income provides
for the carryover of any tax attribute from one taxable period to a subsequent taxable period, the
estate shall succeed to such tax attribute in any case in which such estate is subject to tax under
subsection (a).
(2) After such a case is closed or dismissed, the debtor shall succeed to any tax attribute to which
the estate succeeded under paragraph (1) to the extent consistent with the Internal Revenue Code of
1986.
(3) The estate may carry back any loss or tax attribute to a taxable period of the debtor that ended
before the date of the order for relief under this title to the extent that—
[Release Point 118-106]
(A) applicable State or local tax law provides for a carryback in the case of the debtor; and
(B) the same or a similar tax attribute may be carried back by the estate to such a taxable period
of the debtor under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
(j)(1) For purposes of any State or local law imposing a tax on or measured by income, income is
not realized by the estate, the debtor, or a successor to the debtor by reason of discharge of
indebtedness in a case under this title, except to the extent, if any, that such income is subject to tax
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
(2) Whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides that the amount excluded from gross
income in respect of the discharge of indebtedness in a case under this title shall be applied to reduce
the tax attributes of the debtor or the estate, a similar reduction shall be made under any State or
local law imposing a tax on or measured by income to the extent such State or local law recognizes
such attributes. Such State or local law may also provide for the reduction of other attributes to the
extent that the full amount of income from the discharge of indebtedness has not been applied.
(k)(1) Except as provided in this section and section 505, the time and manner of filing tax returns
and the items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit of any taxpayer shall be determined under
applicable nonbankruptcy law.
(2) For Federal tax purposes, the provisions of this section are subject to the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 and other applicable Federal nonbankruptcy law.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 346 of the House amendment, together with sections 728 and 1146, represent special tax provisions
applicable in bankruptcy. The policy contained in those sections reflects the policy that should be applied in
Federal, State, and local taxes in the view of the House Committee on the Judiciary. The House Ways and
Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee did not have time to process a bankruptcy tax bill
during the 95th Congress. It is anticipated that early in the 96th Congress, and before the effective date of the
bankruptcy code [Oct. 1, 1979], the tax committees of Congress will have an opportunity to consider action
with respect to amendments to the Internal Revenue Code [title 26] and the special tax provisions in title 11.
Since the special tax provisions are likely to be amended during the first part of the 96th Congress, it is
anticipated that the bench and bar will also study and comment on these special tax provisions prior to their
revision.
Special tax provisions: State and local rules. This section provides special tax provisions dealing with the
treatment, under State or local, but not Federal, tax law, of the method of taxing bankruptcy estates of
individuals, partnerships, and corporations; survival and allocation of tax attributes between the bankrupt and
the estate; return filing requirements; and the tax treatment of income from discharge of indebtedness. The
Senate bill removed these rules pending adoption of Federal rules on these issues in the next Congress. The
House amendment returns the State and local tax rules to section 346 so that they may be studied by the
bankruptcy and tax bars who may wish to submit comments to Congress.
Withholding rules: Both the House bill and Senate amendment provide that the trustee is required to comply
with the normal withholding rules applicable to the payment of wages and other payments. The House
amendment retains this rule for State and local taxes only. The treatment of withholding of Federal taxes will
be considered in the next Congress.
Section 726 of the Senate amendment provides that the rule requiring pro rata payment of all expenses
within a priority category does not apply to the payment of amounts withheld by a bankruptcy trustee. The
purpose of this rule was to insure that the trustee pay the full amount of the withheld taxes to the appropriate
governmental tax authority. The House amendment deletes this rule as unnecessary because the existing
practice conforms essentially to that rule. If the trustee fails to pay over in full amounts that he withheld, it is a
violation of his trustee's duties which would permit the taxing authority to sue the trustee on his bond.
When taxes considered "incurred": The Senate amendment contained rules of general application dealing
with when a tax is "incurred" for purposes of the various tax collection rules affecting the debtor and the
[Release Point 118-106]
estate. The House amendment adopts the substance of these rules and transfers them to section 507 of title 11.
Penalty for failure to pay tax: The Senate amendment contains a rule which relieves the debtor and the
trustee from certain tax penalties for failure to make timely payment of a tax to the extent that the bankruptcy
rules prevent the trustee or the debtor from paying the tax on time. Since most of these penalties relate to
Federal taxes, the House amendment deletes these rules pending consideration of Federal tax rules affecting
bankruptcy in the next Congress.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) indicates that subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), and (j) apply notwithstanding any
State or local tax law, but are subject to Federal tax law.
Subsection (b)(1) provides that in a case concerning an individual under chapter 7 or 11 of title 11, income
of the estate is taxable only to the estate and not to the debtor. The second sentence of the paragraph provides
that if such individual is a partner, the tax attributes of the partnership are distributable to the partner's estate
rather than to the partner, except to the extent that section 728 of title 11 provides otherwise.
Subsection (b)(2) states a general rule that the estate of an individual is to be taxed as an estate. The
paragraph is made subject to the remainder of section 346 and section 728 of title 11.
Subsection (b)(3) requires the accounting method, but not necessarily the accounting period, of the estate to
be the same as the method used by the individual debtor.
Subsection (c)(1) states a general rule that the estate of a partnership or a corporated debtor is not a separate
entity for tax purposes. The income of the debtor is to be taxed as if the case were not commenced, except as
provided in the remainder of section 346 and section 728.
Subsection (c)(2) requires the trustee, except as provided in section 728 of title 11, to file all tax returns on
behalf of the partnership or corporation during the case.
Subsection (d) indicates that the estate in a chapter 13 case is not a separate taxable entity and that all
income of the estate is to be taxed to the debtor.
Subsection (e) establishes a business deduction consisting of allowed expenses of administration except for
tax or capital expenses that are not otherwise deductible. The deduction may be used by the estate when it is a
separate taxable entity or by the entity to which the income of the estate is taxed when it is not.
Subsection (f) imposes a duty on the trustee to comply with any Federal, State, or local tax law requiring
withholding or collection of taxes from any payment of wages, salaries, commissions, dividends, interest, or
other payments. Any amount withheld is to be paid to the taxing authority at the same time and with the same
priority as the claim from which such amount withheld was paid.
Subsection (g)(1)(A) indicates that neither gain nor loss is recognized on the transfer by law of property
from the debtor or a creditor to the estate. Subparagraph (B) provides a similar policy if the property of the
estate is returned from the estate to the debtor other than by a sale of property to debtor. Subparagraph (C)
also provides for nonrecognition of gain or loss in a case under chapter 11 if a corporate debtor transfers
property to a successor corporation or to an affiliate under a joint plan. An exception is made to enable a
taxing authority to cause recognition of gain or loss to the extent provided in IRC [title 26] section 371 (as
amended by section 109 of this bill).
Subsection (g)(2) provides that any of the three kinds of transferees specified in paragraph (1) take the
property with the same character, holding period, and basis in the hands of the transferor at the time of such
transfer. The transferor's basis may be adjusted under section 346(j)(5) even if the discharge of indebtedness
occurs after the transfer of property. Of course, no adjustment will occur if the transfer is from the debtor to
the estate or if the transfer is from an entity that is not discharged.
Subsection (h) provides that the creation of the estate of an individual under chapter 7 or 11 of title 11 as a
separate taxable entity does not affect the number of taxable years for purposes of computing loss carryovers
or carrybacks. The section applies with respect to carryovers or carrybacks of the debtor transferred into the
estate under section 346(i)(1) of title 11 or back to the debtor under section 346(i)(2) of title 11.
Subsection (i)(1) states a general rule that an estate that is a separate taxable entity nevertheless succeeds to
all tax attributes of the debtor. The six enumerated attributes are illustrative and not exhaustive.
Subsection (i)(2) indicates that attributes passing from the debtor into an estate that is a separate taxable
entity will return to the debtor if unused by the estate. The debtor is permitted to use any such attribute as
though the case had not been commenced.
Subsection (i)(3) permits an estate that is a separate taxable entity to carryback losses of the estate to a
taxable period of the debtor that ended before the case was filed. The estate is treated as if it were the debtor
with respect to time limitations and other restrictions. The section makes clear that the debtor may not
[Release Point 118-106]
carryback any loss of his own from a tax year during the pendency of the case to such a period until the case is
closed. No tolling of any period of limitation is provided with respect to carrybacks by the debtor of
post-petition losses.
Subsection (j) sets forth seven special rules treating with the tax effects of forgiveness or discharge of
indebtedness. The terms "forgiveness" and "discharge" are redundant, but are used to clarify that "discharge"
in the context of a special tax provision in title 11 includes forgiveness of indebtedness whether or not such
indebtedness is "discharged" in the bankruptcy sense.
Paragraph (1) states the general rule that forgiveness of indebtedness is not taxable except as otherwise
provided in paragraphs (2)–(7). The paragraph is patterned after sections 268, 395, and 520 of the Bankruptcy
Act [sections 668, 795, and 920 of former title 11].
Paragraph (2) disallows deductions for liabilities of a deductible nature in any year during or after the year
of cancellation of such liabilities. For the purposes of this paragraph, "a deduction with respect to a liability"
includes a capital loss incurred on the disposition of a capital asset with respect to a liability that was incurred
in connection with the acquisition of such asset.
Paragraph (3) causes any net operating loss of a debtor that is an individual or corporation to be reduced by
any discharge of indebtedness except as provided in paragraphs (2) or (4). If a deduction is disallowed under
paragraph (2), then no double counting occurs. Thus, paragraph (3) will reflect the reduction of losses by
liabilities that have been forgiven, including deductible liabilities or nondeductible liabilities such as
repayment of principal on borrowed funds.
Paragraph (4) specifically excludes two kinds of indebtedness from reduction of net operating losses under
paragraph (3) or from reduction of basis under paragraph (5). Subparagraph (A) excludes items of a deductible
nature that were not deducted or that could not be deducted such as gambling losses or liabilities for interest
owed to a relative of the debtor. Subparagraph (B) excludes indebtedness of a debtor that is an individual or
corporation that resulted in deductions which did not offset income and that did not contribute to an unexpired
net operating loss or loss carryover. In these situations, the debtor has derived no tax benefit so there is no
need to incur an offsetting reduction.
Paragraph (5) provides a two-point test for reduction of basis. The paragraph replaces sections 270, 396,
and 522 of the Bankruptcy Act [sections 670, 796, and 922 of former title 11]. Subparagraph (A) sets out the
maximum amount by which basis may be reduced—the total indebtedness forgiven less adjustments made
under paragraphs (2) and (3). This avoids double counting. If a deduction is disallowed under paragraph (2) or
a carryover is reduced under paragraph (3) then the tax benefit is neutralized, and there is no need to reduce
basis. Subparagraph (B) reduces basis to the extent the debtor's total basis of assets before the discharge
exceeds total preexisting liabilities still remaining after discharge of indebtedness. This is a "basis solvency"
limitation which differs from the usual test of solvency because it measures against the remaining liabilities
the benefit aspect of assets, their basis, rather than their value. Paragraph (5) applies so that any transferee of
the debtor's property who is required to use the debtor's basis takes the debtor's basis reduced by the lesser of
(A) and (B). Thus, basis will be reduced, but never below a level equal to undischarged liabilities.
Paragraph (6) specifies that basis need not be reduced under paragraph (5) to the extent the debtor treats
discharged indebtedness as taxable income. This permits the debtor to elect whether to recognize income,
which may be advantageous if the debtor anticipates subsequent net operating losses, rather than to reduce
basis.
Paragraph (7) establishes two rules excluding from the category of discharged indebtedness certain
indebtedness that is exchanged for an equity security issued under a plan or that is forgiven as a contribution
to capital by an equity security holder. Subparagraph (A) creates the first exclusion to the extent indebtedness
consisting of items not of a deductible nature is exchanged for an equity security, other than the interests of a
limited partner in a limited partnership, issued by the debtor or is forgiven as a contribution to capital by an
equity security holder. Subparagraph (B) excludes indebtedness consisting of items of a deductible nature, if
the exchange of stock for debts has the same effect as a cash payment equal to the value of the equity security,
in the amount of the fair market value of the equity security or, if less, the extent to which such exchange has
such effect. The two provisions treat the debtor as if it had originally issued stock instead of debt.
Subparagraph (B) rectifies the inequity under current law between a cash basis and accrual basis debtor
concerning the issuance of stock in exchange for previous services rendered that were of a greater value than
the stock. Subparagraph (B) also changes current law by taxing forgiveness of indebtedness to the extent that
stock is exchanged for the accrued interest component of a security, because the recipient of such stock would
not be regarded as having received money under the Carman doctrine.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 347(a) of the House amendment adopts a comparable provision contained in the Senate amendment
instructing the trustee to stop payment on any check remaining unpaid more than 90 days after the final
distribution in a case under Chapter 7 or 13. Technical changes are made in section 347(b) to cover
distributions in a railroad reorganization.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 347 is derived from Bankruptcy Act §66 [section 106 of former title 11]. Subsection (a) requires the
trustee to stop payment on any distribution check that is unpaid 90 days after the final distribution in a case
under chapter 7 or 13. The unclaimed funds, and any other property of the estate are paid into the court and
disposed of under chapter 129 [§2041 et seq.] of title 28, which requires the clerk of court to hold the funds
for their owner for 5 years, after which they escheat to the Treasury.
Subsection (b) specifies that any property remaining unclaimed at the expiration of the time allowed in a
chapter 9 or 11 case for presentation (exchange) of securities or the performance of any other act as a
condition to participation in the plan reverts to the debtor or the entity acquiring the assets of the debtor under
the plan. Conditions to participation under a plan include such acts as cashing a check, surrendering securities
for cancellation, and so on. Similar provisions are found in sections 96(d) and 205 of current law [sections
416(d) and 605 of former title 11].

§348. Effect of conversion
(a) Conversion of a case from a case under one chapter of this title to a case under another chapter
of this title constitutes an order for relief under the chapter to which the case is converted, but, except
as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, does not effect a change in the date of the filing
of the petition, the commencement of the case, or the order for relief.
(b) Unless the court for cause orders otherwise, in sections 701(a), 727(a)(10), 727(b), 1102(a),
1110(a)(1), 1121(b), 1121(c), 1141(d)(4), 1201(a), 1221, 1228(a), 1301(a), and 1305(a) of this title,
"the order for relief under this chapter" in a chapter to which a case has been converted under section
706, 1112, 1208, or 1307 of this title means the conversion of such case to such chapter.
[Release Point 118-106]
(c) Sections 342 and 365(d) of this title apply in a case that has been converted under section 706,
1112, 1208, or 1307 of this title, as if the conversion order were the order for relief.
(d) A claim against the estate or the debtor that arises after the order for relief but before
conversion in a case that is converted under section 1112, 1208, or 1307 of this title, other than a
claim specified in section 503(b) of this title, shall be treated for all purposes as if such claim had
arisen immediately before the date of the filing of the petition.
(e) Conversion of a case under section 706, 1112, 1208, or 1307 of this title terminates the service
of any trustee or examiner that is serving in the case before such conversion.
(f)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), when a case under chapter 13 of this title is converted
to a case under another chapter under this title—
(A) property of the estate in the converted case shall consist of property of the estate, as of the
date of filing of the petition, that remains in the possession of or is under the control of the debtor
on the date of conversion;
(B) valuations of property and of allowed secured claims in the chapter 13 case shall apply only
in a case converted to a case under chapter 11 or 12, but not in a case converted to a case under
chapter 7, with allowed secured claims in cases under chapters 11 and 12 reduced to the extent that
they have been paid in accordance with the chapter 13 plan; and
(C) with respect to cases converted from chapter 13—
(i) the claim of any creditor holding security as of the date of the filing of the petition shall
continue to be secured by that security unless the full amount of such claim determined under
applicable nonbankruptcy law has been paid in full as of the date of conversion,
notwithstanding any valuation or determination of the amount of an allowed secured claim
made for the purposes of the case under chapter 13; and
(ii) unless a prebankruptcy default has been fully cured under the plan at the time of
conversion, in any proceeding under this title or otherwise, the default shall have the effect
given under applicable nonbankruptcy law.
(2) If the debtor converts a case under chapter 13 of this title to a case under another chapter under
this title in bad faith, the property of the estate in the converted case shall consist of the property of
the estate as of the date of conversion.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
The House amendment adopts section 348(b) of the Senate amendment with slight modifications, as more
accurately reflecting sections to which this particular effect of conversion should apply.
Section 348(e) of the House amendment is a stylistic revision of similar provisions contained in H.R. 8200
as passed by the House and in the Senate amendment. Termination of services is expanded to cover any
examiner serving in the case before conversion, as done in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section governs the effect of the conversion of a case from one chapter of the bankruptcy code to
another chapter. Subsection (a) specifies that the date of the filing of the petition, the commencement of the
case, or the order for relief are unaffected by conversion, with some exceptions specified in subsections (b)
and (c).
Subsection (b) lists certain sections in the operative chapters of the bankruptcy code in which there is a
reference to "the order for relief under this chapter." In those sections, the reference is to be read as a reference
to the conversion order if the case has been converted into the particular chapter. Subsection (c) specifies that
notice is to be given of the conversion order the same as notice was given of the order for relief, and that the
time the trustee (or debtor in possession) has for assuming or rejecting executory contracts recommences, thus
giving an opportunity for a newly appointed trustee to familiarize himself with the case.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subsection (d) provides for special treatment of claims that arise during chapter 11 or 13 cases before the
case is converted to a liquidation case. With the exception of claims specified in proposed 11 U.S.C. 503(b)
(administrative expenses), preconversion claims are treated the same as prepetition claims.
Subsection (e) provides that conversion of a case terminates the service of any trustee serving in the case
prior to conversion.

Section 349(b)(2) of the House amendment adds a cross reference to section 553 to reflect the new right of
recovery of setoffs created under that section. Corresponding changes are made throughout the House
amendment.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) specifies that unless the court for cause orders otherwise, the dismissal of a case is without
prejudice. The debtor is not barred from receiving a discharge in a later case of debts that were dischargeable
in the case dismissed. Of course, this subsection refers only to pre-discharge dismissals. If the debtor has
already received a discharge and it is not revoked, then the debtor would be barred under section 727(a) from
receiving a discharge in a subsequent liquidation case for six years. Dismissal of an involuntary on the merits
will generally not give rise to adequate cause so as to bar the debtor from further relief.
Subsection (b) specifies that the dismissal reinstates proceedings or custodianships that were superseded by
the bankruptcy case, reinstates avoided transfers, reinstates voided liens, vacates any order, judgment, or
transfer ordered as a result of the avoidance of a transfer, and revests the property of the estate in the entity in
which the property was vested at the commencement of the case. The court is permitted to order a different
result for cause. The basic purpose of the subsection is to undo the bankruptcy case, as far as practicable, and
to restore all property rights to the position in which they were found at the commencement of the case. This
does not necessarily encompass undoing sales of property from the estate to a good faith purchaser. Where
there is a question over the scope of the subsection, the court will make the appropriate orders to protect rights
acquired in reliance on the bankruptcy case.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 361 of the House amendment represents a compromise between H.R. 8200 as passed by the House
and the Senate amendment regarding the issue of "adequate protection" of a secured party. The House
amendment deletes the provision found in section 361(3) of H.R. 8200 as passed by the House. It would have
permitted adequate protection to be provided by giving the secured party an administrative expense regarding
any decrease in the value of such party's collateral. In every case there is the uncertainty that the estate will
have sufficient property to pay administrative expenses in full.
Section 361(4) of H.R. 8200 as passed by the House is modified in section 361(3) of the House amendment
to indicate that the court may grant other forms of adequate protection, other than an administrative expense,
which will result in the realization by the secured creditor of the indubitable equivalent of the creditor's
interest in property. In the special instance where there is a reserve fund maintained under the security
agreement, such as in the typical bondholder case, indubitable equivalent means that the bondholders would
be entitled to be protected as to the reserve fund, in addition to the regular payments needed to service the
debt. Adequate protection of an interest of an entity in property is intended to protect a creditor's allowed
secured claim. To the extent the protection proves to be inadequate after the fact, the creditor is entitled to a
first priority administrative expense under section 503(b).
In the special case of a creditor who has elected application of creditor making an election under section
1111(b)(2), that creditor is entitled to adequate protection of the creditor's interest in property to the extent of
the value of the collateral not to the extent of the creditor's allowed secured claim, which is inflated to cover a
deficiency as a result of such election.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
[Release Point 118-106]
Sections 362, 363, and 364 require, in certain circumstances, that the court determine in noticed hearings
whether the interest of a secured creditor or co-owner of property with the debtor is adequately protected in
connection with the sale or use of property. The interests of which the court may provide protection in the
ways described in this section include equitable as well as legal interests. For example, a right to enforce a
pledge and a right to recover property delivered to a debtor under a consignment agreement or an agreement
of sale or return are interests that may be entitled to protection. This section specifies means by which
adequate protection may be provided but, to avoid placing the court in an administrative role, does not require
the court to provide it. Instead, the trustee or debtor in possession or the creditor will provide or propose a
protection method. If the party that is affected by the proposed action objects, the court will determine
whether the protection provided is adequate. The purpose of this section is to illustrate means by which it may
be provided and to define the limits of the concept.
The concept of adequate protection is derived from the fifth amendment protection of property interests as
enunciated by the Supreme Court. See Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., 311 U.S. 273 (1940); Louisville
Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, 295 U.S. 555 (1935).
The automatic stay also provides creditor protection. Without it, certain creditors would be able to pursue
their own remedies against the debtor's property. Those who acted first would obtain payment of the claims in
preference to and to the detriment of other creditors. Bankruptcy is designed to provide an orderly liquidation
procedure under which all creditors are treated equally. A race of diligence by creditors for the debtor's assets
prevents that.
Subsection (a) defines the scope of the automatic stay, by listing the acts that are stayed by the
commencement of the case. The commencement or continuation, including the issuance of process, of a
judicial, administrative or other proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before
the commencement of the bankruptcy case is stayed under paragraph (1). The scope of this paragraph is broad.
All proceedings are stayed, including arbitration, administrative, and judicial proceedings. Proceeding in this
sense encompasses civil actions and all proceedings even if they are not before governmental tribunals.
The stay is not permanent. There is adequate provision for relief from the stay elsewhere in the section.
However, it is important that the trustee have an opportunity to inventory the debtor's position before
proceeding with the administration of the case. Undoubtedly the court will lift the stay for proceedings before
specialized or nongovernmental tribunals to allow those proceedings to come to a conclusion. Any party
desiring to enforce an order in such a proceeding would thereafter have to come before the bankruptcy court to
collect assets. Nevertheless, it will often be more appropriate to permit proceedings to continue in their place
of origin, when no great prejudice to the bankruptcy estate would result, in order to leave the parties to their
chosen forum and to relieve the bankruptcy court from many duties that may be handled elsewhere.
Paragraph (2) stays the enforcement, against the debtor or against property of the estate, of a judgment
obtained before the commencement of the bankruptcy case. Thus, execution and levy against the debtors'
prepetition property are stayed, and attempts to collect a judgment from the debtor personally are stayed.
Paragraph (3) stays any act to obtain possession of property of the estate (that is, property of the debtor as
of the date of the filing of the petition) or property from the estate (property over which the estate has control
or possession). The purpose of this provision is to prevent dismemberment of the estate. Liquidation must
proceed in an orderly fashion. Any distribution of property must be by the trustee after he has had an
opportunity to familiarize himself with the various rights and interests involved and with the property
available for distribution.
Paragraph (4) stays lien creation against property of the estate. Thus, taking possession to perfect a lien or
obtaining court process is prohibited. To permit lien creation after bankruptcy would give certain creditors
preferential treatment by making them secured instead of unsecured.
Paragraph (5) stays any act to create or enforce a lien against property of the debtor, that is, most property
that is acquired after the date of the filing of the petition, property that is exempted, or property that does not
pass to the estate, to the extent that the lien secures a prepetition claim. Again, to permit postbankruptcy lien
creation or enforcement would permit certain creditors to receive preferential treatment. It may also
circumvent the debtors' discharge.
Paragraph (6) prevents creditors from attempting in any way to collect a prepetition debt. Creditors in
consumer cases occasionally telephone debtors to encourage repayment in spite of bankruptcy. Inexperienced,
frightened, or ill-counseled debtors may succumb to suggestions to repay notwithstanding their bankruptcy.
This provision prevents evasion of the purpose of the bankruptcy laws by sophisticated creditors.
Paragraph (7) stays setoffs of mutual debts and credits between the debtor and creditors. As with all other
paragraphs of subsection (a), this paragraph does not affect the right of creditors. It simply stays its
enforcement pending an orderly examination of the debtor's and creditors' rights.
Subsection (b) lists seven exceptions to the automatic stay. The effect of an exception is not to make the
[Release Point 118-106]
action immune from injunction.
The court has ample other powers to stay actions not covered by the automatic stay. Section 105, of
proposed title 11, derived from Bankruptcy Act §2a(15) [section 11(a)(15) of former title 11], grants the
power to issue orders necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of title 11. The district court and the
bankruptcy court as its adjunct have all the traditional injunctive powers of a court of equity, 28 U.S.C. §§151
and 164 as proposed in S. 2266, §201, and 28 U.S.C. §1334, as proposed in S. 2266, §216. Stays or
injunctions issued under these other sections will not be automatic upon the commencement of the case, but
will be granted or issued under the usual rules for the issuance of injunctions. By excepting an act or action
from the automatic stay, the bill simply requires that the trustee move the court into action, rather than
requiring the stayed party to request relief from the stay. There are some actions, enumerated in the
exceptions, that generally should not be stayed automatically upon the commencement of the case, for reasons
of either policy or practicality. Thus, the court will have to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a
particular action which may be harming the estate should be stayed.
With respect to stays issued under other powers, or the application of the automatic stay, to governmental
actions, this section and the other sections mentioned are intended to be an express waiver of sovereign
immunity of the Federal Government, and an assertion of the bankruptcy power over State governments under
the supremacy clause notwithstanding a State's sovereign immunity.
The first exception is of criminal proceedings against the debtor. The bankruptcy laws are not a haven for
criminal offenders, but are designed to give relief from financial overextension. Thus, criminal actions and
proceedings may proceed in spite of bankruptcy.
Paragraph (2) excepts from the stay the collection of alimony, maintenance or support from property that is
not property of the estate. This will include property acquired after the commencement of the case, exempted
property, and property that does not pass to the estate. The automatic stay is one means of protecting the
debtor's discharge. Alimony, maintenance and support obligations are excepted from discharge. Staying
collection of them, when not to the detriment of other creditors (because the collection effort is against
property that is not property of the estate) does not further that goal. Moreover, it could lead to hardship on the
part of the protected spouse or children.
Paragraph (3) excepts any act to perfect an interest in property to the extent that the trustee's rights and
powers are limited under section 546(a) of the bankruptcy code. That section permits postpetition perfection
of certain liens to be effective against the trustee. If the act of perfection, such as filing, were stayed, the
section would be nullified.
Paragraph (4) excepts commencement or continuation of actions and proceedings by governmental units to
enforce police or regulatory powers. Thus, where a governmental unit is suing a debtor to prevent or stop
violation of fraud, environmental protection, consumer protection, safety, or similar police or regulatory laws,
or attempting to fix damages for violation of such a law, the action or proceeding is not stayed under the
automatic stay.
Paragraph (5) makes clear that the exception extends to permit an injunction and enforcement of an
injunction, and to permit the entry of a money judgment, but does not extend to permit enforcement of a
money judgment. Since the assets of the debtor are in the possession and control of the bankruptcy court, and
since they constitute a fund out of which all creditors are entitled to share, enforcement by a governmental
unit of a money judgment would give it preferential treatment to the detriment of all other creditors.
Paragraph (6) excepts the setoff of any mutual debt and claim for commodity transactions.
Paragraph (7) excepts actions by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to foreclose or take
possession in a case of a loan insured under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.]. A general
exception for such loans is found in current sections 263 and 517 [sections 663 and 917 of former title 11], the
exception allowed by this paragraph is much more limited.
Subsection (c) of section 362 specifies the duration of the automatic stay. Paragraph (1) terminates a stay of
an act against property of the estate when the property ceases to be property of the estate, such as by sale,
abandonment, or exemption. It does not terminate the stay against property of the debtor if the property leaves
the estate and goes to the debtor. Paragraph (2) terminates the stay of any other act on the earliest of the time
the case is closed, the time the case is dismissed, or the time a discharge is granted or denied (unless the
debtor is a corporation or partnership in a chapter 7 case).
Subsection (c) governs automatic termination of the stay. Subsections (d) through (g) govern termination of
the stay by the court on the request of a party in interest.
Subsection (d) requires the court, upon motion of a party in interest, to grant relief from the stay for cause,
such as by terminating, annulling, modifying, or conditioning the stay. The lack of adequate protection of an
interest in property is one cause for relief, but is not the only cause. Other causes might include the lack of any
connection with or interference with the pending bankruptcy case. Generally, proceedings in which the debtor
[Release Point 118-106]
is a fiduciary, or involving postpetition activities of the debtor, need not be stayed because they bear no
relationship to the purpose of the automatic stay, which is protection of the debtor and his estate from his
creditors.
Upon the court's finding that the debtor has no equity in the property subject to the stay and that the
property is not necessary to an effective reorganization of the debtor, the subsection requires the court grant
relief from the stay. To aid in this determination, guidelines are established where the property subject to the
stay is real property. An exception to "the necessary to an effective reorganization" requirement is made for
real property on which no business is being conducted other than operating the real property and activities
incident thereto. The intent of this exception is to reach the single-asset apartment type cases which involve
primarily tax-shelter investments and for which the bankruptcy laws have provided a too facile method to
relay conditions, but not the operating shopping center and hotel cases where attempts at reorganization
should be permitted. Property in which the debtor has equity but which is not necessary to an effective
reorganization of the debtor should be sold under section 363. Hearings under this subsection are given
calendar priority to ensure that court congestion will not unduly prejudice the rights of creditors who may be
obviously entitled to relief from the operation of the automatic stay.
Subsection (e) provides protection that is not always available under present law. The subsection sets a time
certain within which the bankruptcy court must rule on the adequacy of protection provided for the secured
creditor's interest. If the court does not rule within 30 days from a request by motion for relief from the stay,
the stay is automatically terminated with respect to the property in question. To accommodate more complex
cases, the subsection permits the court to make a preliminary ruling after a preliminary hearing. After a
preliminary hearing, the court may continue the stay only if there is a reasonable likelihood that the party
opposing relief from the stay will prevail at the final hearing. Because the stay is essentially an injunction, the
three stages of the stay may be analogized to the three stages of an injunction. The filing of the petition which
gives rise to the automatic stay is similar to a temporary restraining order. The preliminary hearing is similar
to the hearing on a preliminary injunction, and the final hearing and order are similar to the hearing and
issuance or denial of a permanent injunction. The main difference lies in which party must bring the issue
before the court. While in the injunction setting, the party seeking the injunction must prosecute the action, in
proceeding for relief from the automatic stay, the enjoined party must move. The difference does not,
however, shift the burden of proof. Subsection (g) leaves that burden on the party opposing relief from the
stay (that is, on the party seeking continuance of the injunction) on the issue of adequate protection and
existence of an equity. It is not, however, intended to be confined strictly to the constitutional requirement.
This section and the concept of adequate protection are based as much on policy grounds as on constitutional
grounds. Secured creditors should not be deprived of the benefit of their bargain. There may be situations in
bankruptcy where giving a secured creditor an absolute right to his bargain may be impossible or seriously
detrimental to the policy of the bankruptcy laws. Thus, this section recognizes the availability of alternate
means of protecting a secured creditor's interest where such steps are a necessary part of the rehabilitative
process. Though the creditor might not be able to retain his lien upon the specific collateral held at the time of
filing, the purpose of the section is to insure that the secured creditor receives the value for which he
bargained.
The section specifies two exclusive means of providing adequate protection, both of which may require an
approximate determination of the value of the protected entity's interest in the property involved. The section
does not specify how value is to be determined, nor does it specify when it is to be determined. These matters
are left to case-by-case interpretation and development. In light of the restrictive approach of the section to the
availability of means of providing adequate protection, this flexibility is important to permit the courts to
adapt to varying circumstances and changing modes of financing.
Neither is it expected that the courts will construe the term value to mean, in every case, forced sale
liquidation value or full going concern value. There is wide latitude between those two extremes although
forced sale liquidation value will be a minimum.
In any particular case, especially a reorganization case, the determination of which entity should be entitled
to the difference between the going concern value and the liquidation value must be based on equitable
considerations arising from the facts of the case. Finally, the determination of value is binding only for the
purposes of the specific hearing and is not to have a res judicata effect.
The first method of adequate protection outlined is the making of cash payments to compensate for the
expected decrease in value of the opposing entity's interest. This provision is derived from In re Bermec
Corporation, 445 F.2d 367 (2d Cir. 1971), though in that case it is not clear whether the payments offered
were adequate to compensate the secured creditors for their loss. The use of periodic payments may be
[Release Point 118-106]
appropriate where, for example, the property in question is depreciating at a relatively fixed rate. The periodic
payments would be to compensate for the depreciation and might, but need not necessarily, be in the same
amount as payments due on the secured obligation.
The second method is the fixing of an additional or replacement lien on other property of the debtor to the
extent of the decrease in value or actual consumption of the property involved. The purpose of this method is
to provide the protected entity with an alternative means of realizing the value of the original property, if it
should decline during the case, by granting an interest in additional property from whose value the entity may
realize its loss. This is consistent with the view expressed in Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., 311 U.S.
273 (1940), where the Court suggested that it was the value of the secured creditor's collateral, and not
necessarily his rights in specific collateral, that was entitled to protection.
The section makes no provision for the granting of an administrative priority as a method of providing
adequate protection to an entity as was suggested in In re Yale Express System, Inc., 384 F.2d 990 (2d Cir.
1967), because such protection is too uncertain to be meaningful.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
The section specifies four means of providing adequate protection. They are neither exclusive nor
exhaustive. They all rely, however, on the value of the protected entity's interest in the property involved. The
section does not specify how value is to be determined, nor does it specify when it is to be determined. These
matters are left to case-by-case interpretation and development. It is expected that the courts will apply the
concept in light of facts of each case and general equitable principles. It is not intended that the courts will
develop a hard and fast rule that will apply in every case. The time and method of valuation is not specified
precisely, in order to avoid that result. There are an infinite number of variations possible in dealings between
debtors and creditors, the law is continually developing, and new ideas are continually being implemented in
this field. The flexibility is important to permit the courts to adapt to varying circumstances and changing
modes of financing.
Neither is it expected that the courts will construe the term value to mean, in every case, forced sale
liquidation value or full going concern value. There is wide latitude between those two extremes. In any
particular case, especially a reorganization case, the determination of which entity should be entitled to the
difference between the going concern value and the liquidation value must be based on equitable
considerations based on the facts of the case. It will frequently be based on negotiation between the parties.
Only if they cannot agree will the court become involved.
The first method of adequate protection specified is periodic cash payments by the estate, to the extent of a
decrease in value of the opposing entity's interest in the property involved. This provision is derived from In
re Yale Express, Inc., 384 F.2d 990 (2d Cir. 1967) (though in that case it is not clear whether the payments
required were adequate to compensate the secured creditors for their loss). The use of periodic payments may
be appropriate, where for example, the property in question is depreciating at a relatively fixed rate. The
periodic payments would be to compensate for the depreciation.
The second method is the provision of an additional or replacement lien on other property to the extent of
the decrease in value of the property involved. The purpose of this method is to provide the protected entity
with a means of realizing the value of the original property, if it should decline during the case, by granting an
interest in additional property from whose value the entity may realize its loss.
The third method is the granting of an administrative expense priority to the protected entity to the extent of
his loss. This method, more than the others, requires a prediction as to whether the unencumbered assets that
will remain if the case if converted from reorganization to liquidation will be sufficient to pay the protected
entity in full. It is clearly the most risky, from the entity's perspective, and should be used only when there is
relative certainty that administrative expenses will be able to be paid in full in the event of liquidation.
The fourth [enacted as third] method gives the parties and the courts flexibility by allowing such other relief
as will result in the realization by the protected entity of the value of its interest in the property involved.
Under this provision, the courts will be able to adapt to new methods of financing and to formulate protection
that is appropriate to the circumstances of the case if none of the other methods would accomplish the desired
result. For example, another form of adequate protection might be the guarantee by a third party outside the
judicial process of compensation for any loss incurred in the case. Adequate protection might also, in some
circumstances, be provided by permitting a secured creditor to bid in his claim at the sale of the property and
to offset the claim against the price bid in.
The paragraph also defines, more clearly than the others, the general concept of adequate protection, by
requiring such relief as will result in the realization of value. It is the general category, and as such, is defined
by the concept involved rather than any particular method of adequate protection.

pending within the 1-year period;
(II) a previous case under this title in which the individual was a debtor was dismissed

petition or other documents as required by this title or the court without substantial excuse
(but mere inadvertence or negligence shall not be substantial excuse unless the dismissal was
caused by the negligence of the debtor's attorney), failed to provide adequate protection as
ordered by the court, or failed to perform the terms of a plan confirmed by the court; or
(III) there has not been a substantial change in the financial or personal affairs of the
debtor since the dismissal of the next most previous case under this title, or any other reason
to conclude that the later case will not be concluded, if a case under chapter 7, with a
discharge, and if a case under chapter 11 or 13, with a confirmed plan that will be fully
performed; or
(ii) as to any creditor that commenced an action under subsection (d) in a previous case in
which the individual was a debtor if, as of the date of dismissal of such case, such action was
still pending or had been resolved by terminating, conditioning, or limiting the stay as to such
action of such creditor.
(d) On request of a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court shall grant relief from

interest;
(2) with respect to a stay of an act against property under subsection (a) of this section, if—
(A) the debtor does not have an equity in such property; and
(B) such property is not necessary to an effective reorganization;
(3) with respect to a stay of an act against single asset real estate under subsection (a), by a
creditor whose claim is secured by an interest in such real estate, unless, not later than the date that
is 90 days after the entry of the order for relief (or such later date as the court may determine for
cause by order entered within that 90-day period) or 30 days after the court determines that the
debtor is subject to this paragraph, whichever is later—
(A) the debtor has filed a plan of reorganization that has a reasonable possibility of being
[Release Point 118-106]
confirmed within a reasonable time; or
(B) the debtor has commenced monthly payments that—
(i) may, in the debtor's sole discretion, notwithstanding section 363(c)(2), be made from
rents or other income generated before, on, or after the date of the commencement of the case
by or from the property to each creditor whose claim is secured by such real estate (other than
a claim secured by a judgment lien or by an unmatured statutory lien); and
(ii) are in an amount equal to interest at the then applicable nondefault contract rate of
interest on the value of the creditor's interest in the real estate; or
(4) with respect to a stay of an act against real property under subsection (a), by a creditor
whose claim is secured by an interest in such real property, if the court finds that the filing of the
petition was part of a scheme to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors that involved either—
(A) transfer of all or part ownership of, or other interest in, such real property without the
consent of the secured creditor or court approval; or
(B) multiple bankruptcy filings affecting such real property.
If recorded in compliance with applicable State laws governing notices of interests or liens in real
property, an order entered under paragraph (4) shall be binding in any other case under this title
purporting to affect such real property filed not later than 2 years after the date of the entry of such
order by the court, except that a debtor in a subsequent case under this title may move for relief from
such order based upon changed circumstances or for good cause shown, after notice and a hearing.
Any Federal, State, or local governmental unit that accepts notices of interests or liens in real
property shall accept any certified copy of an order described in this subsection for indexing and
recording.
(e)(1) Thirty days after a request under subsection (d) of this section for relief from the stay of any
act against property of the estate under subsection (a) of this section, such stay is terminated with
respect to the party in interest making such request, unless the court, after notice and a hearing,
orders such stay continued in effect pending the conclusion of, or as a result of, a final hearing and
determination under subsection (d) of this section. A hearing under this subsection may be a
preliminary hearing, or may be consolidated with the final hearing under subsection (d) of this
section. The court shall order such stay continued in effect pending the conclusion of the final
hearing under subsection (d) of this section if there is a reasonable likelihood that the party opposing
relief from such stay will prevail at the conclusion of such final hearing. If the hearing under this
subsection is a preliminary hearing, then such final hearing shall be concluded not later than thirty
days after the conclusion of such preliminary hearing, unless the 30-day period is extended with the
consent of the parties in interest or for a specific time which the court finds is required by compelling
circumstances.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in a case under chapter 7, 11, or 13 in which the debtor is an
individual, the stay under subsection (a) shall terminate on the date that is 60 days after a request is
made by a party in interest under subsection (d), unless—
(A) a final decision is rendered by the court during the 60-day period beginning on the date of
the request; or
(B) such 60-day period is extended—
(i) by agreement of all parties in interest; or
(ii) by the court for such specific period of time as the court finds is required for good cause,
as described in findings made by the court.
(f) Upon request of a party in interest, the court, with or without a hearing, shall grant such relief
from the stay provided under subsection (a) of this section as is necessary to prevent irreparable
damage to the interest of an entity in property, if such interest will suffer such damage before there is
an opportunity for notice and a hearing under subsection (d) or (e) of this section.
(g) In any hearing under subsection (d) or (e) of this section concerning relief from the stay of any
act under subsection (a) of this section—
[Release Point 118-106]
(1) the party requesting such relief has the burden of proof on the issue of the debtor's equity in
property; and
(2) the party opposing such relief has the burden of proof on all other issues.
(h)(1) In a case in which the debtor is an individual, the stay provided by subsection (a) is
terminated with respect to personal property of the estate or of the debtor securing in whole or in part
a claim, or subject to an unexpired lease, and such personal property shall no longer be property of
the estate if the debtor fails within the applicable time set by section 521(a)(2)—
(A) to file timely any statement of intention required under section 521(a)(2) with respect to
such personal property or to indicate in such statement that the debtor will either surrender such
personal property or retain it and, if retaining such personal property, either redeem such personal
property pursuant to section 722, enter into an agreement of the kind specified in section 524(c)
applicable to the debt secured by such personal property, or assume such unexpired lease pursuant
to section 365(p) if the trustee does not do so, as applicable; and
(B) to take timely the action specified in such statement, as it may be amended before expiration
of the period for taking action, unless such statement specifies the debtor's intention to reaffirm
such debt on the original contract terms and the creditor refuses to agree to the reaffirmation on
such terms.
(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply if the court determines, on the motion of the trustee filed before
the expiration of the applicable time set by section 521(a)(2), after notice and a hearing, that such
personal property is of consequential value or benefit to the estate, and orders appropriate adequate
protection of the creditor's interest, and orders the debtor to deliver any collateral in the debtor's
possession to the trustee. If the court does not so determine, the stay provided by subsection (a) shall
terminate upon the conclusion of the hearing on the motion.
(i) If a case commenced under chapter 7, 11, or 13 is dismissed due to the creation of a debt
repayment plan, for purposes of subsection (c)(3), any subsequent case commenced by the debtor
under any such chapter shall not be presumed to be filed not in good faith.
(j) On request of a party in interest, the court shall issue an order under subsection (c) confirming
that the automatic stay has been terminated.
(k)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an individual injured by any willful violation of a stay
provided by this section shall recover actual damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, and, in

default that gave rise to the judgment under which possession is sought by the lessor, subsection

[Release Point 118-106]
(2), and serves such objection upon the debtor, the court shall hold a hearing within 10 days after the
filing and service of such objection to determine if the certification filed by the debtor under
paragraph (1) or (2) is true.

from the stay provided under subsection (a)(3) shall not be required to enable the lessor to
complete the process to recover full possession of the property; and
(B) the clerk of the court shall immediately serve upon the lessor and the debtor a certified copy
of the docket indicating the absence of a filed certification and the applicability of the exception to
the stay under subsection (b)(22).

accordance with paragraph (1)(B) to the lessor.
(m)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, subsection (b)(23) shall apply on the date

(B) If the debtor files and serves the objection under subparagraph (A), the court shall hold a
hearing within 10 days after the filing and service of such objection to determine if the situation
giving rise to the lessor's certification under paragraph (1) existed or has been remedied.
(C) If the debtor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court that the situation giving rise to the

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 362(a)(1) of the House amendment adopts the provision contained in the Senate amendment
[Release Point 118-106]
enjoining the commencement or continuation of a judicial, administrative, or other proceeding to recover a
claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case. The provision is beneficial and
interacts with section 362(a)(6), which also covers assessment, to prevent harassment of the debtor with
respect to pre-petition claims.
Section 362(a)(7) contains a provision contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House. The differing
provision in the Senate amendment was rejected. It is not possible that a debt owing to the debtor may be
offset against an interest in the debtor.
Section 362(a)(8) is new. The provision stays the commencement or continuation of any proceeding
concerning the debtor before the U.S. Tax Court.
Section 362(b)(4) indicates that the stay under section 362(a)(1) does not apply to affect the commencement
or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce the governmental unit's police or
regulatory power. This section is intended to be given a narrow construction in order to permit governmental
units to pursue actions to protect the public health and safety and not to apply to actions by a governmental
unit to protect a pecuniary interest in property of the debtor or property of the estate.
Section 362(b)(6) of the House amendment adopts a provision contained in the Senate amendment
restricting the exception to the automatic stay with respect to setoffs to permit only the setoff of mutual debts
and claims. Traditionally, the right of setoff has been limited to mutual debts and claims and the lack of the
clarifying term "mutual" in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House created an unintentional ambiguity. Section
362(b)(7) of the House amendment permits the issuance of a notice of tax deficiency. The House amendment
rejects section 362(b)(7) in the Senate amendment. It would have permitted a particular governmental unit to
obtain a pecuniary advantage without a hearing on the merits contrary to the exceptions contained in sections
362(b)(4) and (5).
Section 362(d) of the House amendment represents a compromise between comparable provisions in the
House bill and Senate amendment. Under section 362(d)(1) of the House amendment, the court may
terminate, annul, modify, or condition the automatic stay for cause, including lack of adequate protection of an
interest in property of a secured party. It is anticipated that the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure will provide
that those hearings will receive priority on the calendar. Under section 362(d)(2) the court may alternatively
terminate, annul, modify, or condition the automatic stay for cause including inadequate protection for the
creditor. The court shall grant relief from the stay if there is no equity and it is not necessary to an effective
reorganization of the debtor.
The latter requirement is contained in section 362(d)(2). This section is intended to solve the problem of
real property mortgage foreclosures of property where the bankruptcy petition is filed on the eve of
foreclosure. The section is not intended to apply if the business of the debtor is managing or leasing real
property, such as a hotel operation, even though the debtor has no equity if the property is necessary to an
effective reorganization of the debtor. Similarly, if the debtor does have an equity in the property, there is no
requirement that the property be sold under section 363 of title 11 as would have been required by the Senate
amendment.
Section 362(e) of the House amendment represents a modification of provisions in H.R. 8200 as passed by
the House and the Senate amendment to make clear that a final hearing must be commenced within 30 days
after a preliminary hearing is held to determine whether a creditor will be entitled to relief from the automatic
stay. In order to insure that those hearings will in fact occur within such 30-day period, it is anticipated that
the rules of bankruptcy procedure provide that such final hearings receive priority on the court calendar.
Section 362(g) places the burden of proof on the issue of the debtor's equity in collateral on the party
requesting relief from the automatic stay and the burden on other issues on the debtor.
An amendment has been made to section 362(b) to permit the Secretary of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development to commence an action to foreclose a mortgage or deed of trust. The commencement of
such an action is necessary for tax purposes. The section is not intended to permit the continuation of such an
action after it is commenced nor is the section to be construed to entitle the Secretary to take possession in lieu
of foreclosure.
Automatic stay: Sections 362(b)(8) and (9) contained in the Senate amendment are largely deleted in the
House amendment. Those provisions add to the list of actions not stayed (a) jeopardy assessments, (b) other
assessments, and (c) the issuance of deficiency notices. In the House amendment, jeopardy assessments
against property which ceases to be property of the estate is already authorized by section 362(c)(1). Other
assessments are specifically stayed under section 362(a)(6), while the issuance of a deficiency notice is
specifically permitted. Stay of the assessment and the permission to issue a statutory notice of a tax deficiency
will permit the debtor to take his personal tax case to the Tax Court, if the bankruptcy judge authorizes him to
do so (as explained more fully in the discussion of section 505).
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
[Release Point 118-106]
The automatic stay is one of the fundamental debtor protections provided by the bankruptcy laws. It gives
the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors. It stops all collection efforts, all harassment, and all foreclosure
actions. It permits the debtor to attempt a repayment or reorganization plan, or simply to be relieved of the
financial pressures that drove him into bankruptcy.
The action commenced by the party seeking relief from the stay is referred to as a motion to make it clear
that at the expedited hearing under subsection (e), and at hearings on relief from the stay, the only issue will
be the lack of adequate protection, the debtor's equity in the property, and the necessity of the property to an
effective reorganization of the debtor, or the existence of other cause for relief from the stay. This hearing will
not be the appropriate time at which to bring in other issues, such as counterclaims against the creditor, which,
although relevant to the question of the amount of the debt, concern largely collateral or unrelated matters.
This approach is consistent with that taken in cases such as In re Essex Properties, Ltd., 430 F.Supp. 1112
(N.D.Cal.1977), that an action seeking relief from the stay is not the assertion of a claim which would give
rise to the right or obligation to assert counterclaims. Those counterclaims are not to be handled in the
summary fashion that the preliminary hearing under this provision will be. Rather, they will be the subject of
more complete proceedings by the trustee to recover property of the estate or to object to the allowance of a
claim. However, this would not preclude the party seeking continuance of the stay from presenting evidence
on the existence of claims which the court may consider in exercising its discretion. What is precluded is a
determination of such collateral claims on the merits at the hearing.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Paragraph (7) [of subsec. (a)] stays setoffs of mutual debts and credits between the debtor and creditors. As
with all other paragraphs of subsection (a), this paragraph does not affect the right of creditors. It simply stays
its enforcement pending an orderly examination of the debtor's and creditors' rights.
Subsection (c) governs automatic termination of the stay. Subsections (d) through (g) govern termination of
the stay by the court on the request of a party in interest. Subsection (d) requires the court, on request of a
party in interest, to grant relief from the stay, such as by terminating, annulling, modifying, or conditioning the
stay, for cause. The lack of adequate protection of an interest in property of the party requesting relief from
the stay is one cause for relief, but is not the only cause. As noted above, a desire to permit an action to
proceed to completion in another tribunal may provide another cause. Other causes might include the lack of
any connection with or interference with the pending bankruptcy case. For example, a divorce or child custody
proceeding involving the debtor may bear no relation to the bankruptcy case. In that case, it should not be
stayed. A probate proceeding in which the debtor is the executor or administrator of another's estate usually
will not be related to the bankruptcy case, and should not be stayed. Generally, proceedings in which the
debtor is a fiduciary, or involving postpetition activities of the debtor, need not be stayed because they bear no
relationship to the purpose of the automatic stay, which is debtor protection from his creditors. The facts of
each request will determine whether relief is appropriate under the circumstances.
Subsection (e) provides a protection for secured creditors that is not available under present law. The
subsection sets a time certain within which the bankruptcy court must rule on the adequacy of protection
provided of the secured creditor's interest. If the court does not rule within 30 days from a request for relief
from the stay, the stay is automatically terminated with respect to the property in question. In order to
accommodate more complex cases, the subsection permits the court to make a preliminary ruling after a
preliminary hearing. After a preliminary hearing, the court may continue the stay only if there is a reasonable
likelihood that the party opposing relief from the stay will prevail at the final hearing. Because the stay is
essentially an injunction, the three stages of the stay may be analogized to the three stages of an injunction.
The filing of the petition which gives rise to the automatic stay is similar to a temporary restraining order. The
preliminary hearing is similar to the hearing on a preliminary injunction, and the final hearing and order is
similar to a permanent injunction. The main difference lies in which party must bring the issue before the
court. While in the injunction setting, the party seeking the injunction must prosecute the action, in
proceedings for relief from the automatic stay, the enjoined party must move. The difference does not,
however, shift the burden of proof. Subsection (g) leaves that burden on the party opposing relief from the
stay (that is, on the party seeking continuance of the injunction) on the issue of adequate protection.
At the expedited hearing under subsection (e), and at all hearings on relief from the stay, the only issue will
be the claim of the creditor and the lack of adequate protection or existence of other cause for relief from the
stay. This hearing will not be the appropriate time at which to bring in other issues, such as counterclaims
against the creditor on largely unrelated matters. Those counterclaims are not to be handled in the summary
fashion that the preliminary hearing under this provision will be. Rather, they will be the subject of more
complete proceedings by the trustees to recover property of the estate or to object to the allowance of a claim.

(a) In this section, "cash collateral" means cash, negotiable instruments, documents of title,
[Release Point 118-106]
securities, deposit accounts, or other cash equivalents whenever acquired in which the estate and an
entity other than the estate have an interest and includes the proceeds, products, offspring, rents, or
profits of property and the fees, charges, accounts or other payments for the use or occupancy of
rooms and other public facilities in hotels, motels, or other lodging properties subject to a security
interest as provided in section 552(b) of this title, whether existing before or after the
commencement of a case under this title.
(b)(1) The trustee, after notice and a hearing, may use, sell, or lease, other than in the ordinary
course of business, property of the estate, except that if the debtor in connection with offering a
product or a service discloses to an individual a policy prohibiting the transfer of personally
identifiable information about individuals to persons that are not affiliated with the debtor and if such
policy is in effect on the date of the commencement of the case, then the trustee may not sell or lease
personally identifiable information to any person unless—
(A) such sale or such lease is consistent with such policy; or
(B) after appointment of a consumer privacy ombudsman in accordance with section 332, and
after notice and a hearing, the court approves such sale or such lease—
(i) giving due consideration to the facts, circumstances, and conditions of such sale or such
lease; and
(ii) finding that no showing was made that such sale or such lease would violate applicable
nonbankruptcy law.
(2) If notification is required under subsection (a) of section 7A of the Clayton Act in the case of a
transaction under this subsection, then—
(A) notwithstanding subsection (a) of such section, the notification required by such subsection
to be given by the debtor shall be given by the trustee; and
(B) notwithstanding subsection (b) of such section, the required waiting period shall end on the
15th day after the date of the receipt, by the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney
General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, of the notification
required under such subsection (a), unless such waiting period is extended—
(i) pursuant to subsection (e)(2) of such section, in the same manner as such subsection (e)(2)
applies to a cash tender offer;
(ii) pursuant to subsection (g)(2) of such section; or
(iii) by the court after notice and a hearing.
(c)(1) If the business of the debtor is authorized to be operated under section 721, 1108, 1183,
1184, 1203, 1204, or 1304 of this title and unless the court orders otherwise, the trustee may enter
into transactions, including the sale or lease of property of the estate, in the ordinary course of
business, without notice or a hearing, and may use property of the estate in the ordinary course of
business without notice or a hearing.
(2) The trustee may not use, sell, or lease cash collateral under paragraph (1) of this subsection
unless—
(A) each entity that has an interest in such cash collateral consents; or
(B) the court, after notice and a hearing, authorizes such use, sale, or lease in accordance with
the provisions of this section.
(3) Any hearing under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection may be a preliminary hearing or may be
consolidated with a hearing under subsection (e) of this section, but shall be scheduled in accordance
with the needs of the debtor. If the hearing under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection is a preliminary
hearing, the court may authorize such use, sale, or lease only if there is a reasonable likelihood that
the trustee will prevail at the final hearing under subsection (e) of this section. The court shall act
promptly on any request for authorization under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection.
(4) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the trustee shall segregate and account
for any cash collateral in the trustee's possession, custody, or control.
(d) The trustee may use, sell, or lease property under subsection (b) or (c) of this section—
[Release Point 118-106]
(1) in the case of a debtor that is a corporation or trust that is not a moneyed business,
commercial corporation, or trust, only in accordance with nonbankruptcy law applicable to the
transfer of property by a debtor that is such a corporation or trust; and
(2) only to the extent not inconsistent with any relief granted under subsection (c), (d), (e), or (f)
of section 362.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, at any time, on request of an entity that
has an interest in property used, sold, or leased, or proposed to be used, sold, or leased, by the
trustee, the court, with or without a hearing, shall prohibit or condition such use, sale, or lease as is
necessary to provide adequate protection of such interest. This subsection also applies to property
that is subject to any unexpired lease of personal property (to the exclusion of such property being
subject to an order to grant relief from the stay under section 362).
(f) The trustee may sell property under subsection (b) or (c) of this section free and clear of any
interest in such property of an entity other than the estate, only if—
(1) applicable nonbankruptcy law permits sale of such property free and clear of such interest;
(2) such entity consents;
(3) such interest is a lien and the price at which such property is to be sold is greater than the
aggregate value of all liens on such property;
(4) such interest is in bona fide dispute; or
(5) such entity could be compelled, in a legal or equitable proceeding, to accept a money
satisfaction of such interest.
(g) Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this section, the trustee may sell property under subsection
(b) or (c) of this section free and clear of any vested or contingent right in the nature of dower or
curtesy.
(h) Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this section, the trustee may sell both the estate's interest,
under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, and the interest of any co-owner in property in which the
debtor had, at the time of the commencement of the case, an undivided interest as a tenant in
common, joint tenant, or tenant by the entirety, only if—
(1) partition in kind of such property among the estate and such co-owners is impracticable;
(2) sale of the estate's undivided interest in such property would realize significantly less for the
estate than sale of such property free of the interests of such co-owners;
(3) the benefit to the estate of a sale of such property free of the interests of co-owners
outweighs the detriment, if any, to such co-owners; and
(4) such property is not used in the production, transmission, or distribution, for sale, of electric
energy or of natural or synthetic gas for heat, light, or power.
(i) Before the consummation of a sale of property to which subsection (g) or (h) of this section
applies, or of property of the estate that was community property of the debtor and the debtor's

such property, as the case may be, may purchase such property at the price at which such sale is to be
consummated.
(j) After a sale of property to which subsection (g) or (h) of this section applies, the trustee shall
distribute to the debtor's spouse or the co-owners of such property, as the case may be, and to the
estate, the proceeds of such sale, less the costs and expenses, not including any compensation of the
trustee, of such sale, according to the interests of such spouse or co-owners, and of the estate.
(k) At a sale under subsection (b) of this section of property that is subject to a lien that secures an
allowed claim, unless the court for cause orders otherwise the holder of such claim may bid at such
sale, and, if the holder of such claim purchases such property, such holder may offset such claim
against the purchase price of such property.
(l) Subject to the provisions of section 365, the trustee may use, sell, or lease property under
subsection (b) or (c) of this section, or a plan under chapter 11, 12, or 13 of this title may provide for
the use, sale, or lease of property, notwithstanding any provision in a contract, a lease, or applicable
[Release Point 118-106]
law that is conditioned on the insolvency or financial condition of the debtor, on the commencement
of a case under this title concerning the debtor, or on the appointment of or the taking possession by
a trustee in a case under this title or a custodian, and that effects, or gives an option to effect, a
forfeiture, modification, or termination of the debtor's interest in such property.
(m) The reversal or modification on appeal of an authorization under subsection (b) or (c) of this
section of a sale or lease of property does not affect the validity of a sale or lease under such
authorization to an entity that purchased or leased such property in good faith, whether or not such
entity knew of the pendency of the appeal, unless such authorization and such sale or lease were
stayed pending appeal.
(n) The trustee may avoid a sale under this section if the sale price was controlled by an agreement
among potential bidders at such sale, or may recover from a party to such agreement any amount by
which the value of the property sold exceeds the price at which such sale was consummated, and
may recover any costs, attorneys' fees, or expenses incurred in avoiding such sale or recovering such
amount. In addition to any recovery under the preceding sentence, the court may grant judgment for
punitive damages in favor of the estate and against any such party that entered into such an
agreement in willful disregard of this subsection.

transaction that is subject to the Truth in Lending Act or any interest in a consumer credit contract
(as defined in section 433.1 of title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations (January 1, 2004), as
amended from time to time), and if such interest is purchased through a sale under this section, then
such person shall remain subject to all claims and defenses that are related to such consumer credit
transaction or such consumer credit contract, to the same extent as such person would be subject to
such claims and defenses of the consumer had such interest been purchased at a sale not under this
section.
(p) In any hearing under this section—
(1) the trustee has the burden of proof on the issue of adequate protection; and
(2) the entity asserting an interest in property has the burden of proof on the issue of the

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 363(a) of the House amendment defines "cash collateral" as defined in the Senate amendment. The
broader definition of "soft collateral" contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House is deleted to remove
limitations that were placed on the use, lease, or sale of inventory, accounts, contract rights, general
intangibles, and chattel paper by the trustee or debtor in possession.
Section 363(c)(2) of the House amendment is derived from the Senate amendment. Similarly, sections
363(c)(3) and (4) are derived from comparable provisions in the Senate amendment in lieu of the contrary
procedure contained in section 363(c) as passed by the House. The policy of the House amendment will
generally require the court to schedule a preliminary hearing in accordance with the needs of the debtor to
authorize the trustee or debtor in possession to use, sell, or lease cash collateral. The trustee or debtor in
possession may use, sell, or lease cash collateral in the ordinary course of business only "after notice and a
hearing."
Section 363(f) of the House amendment adopts an identical provision contained in the House bill, as
opposed to an alternative provision contained in the Senate amendment.
Section 363(h) of the House amendment adopts a new paragraph (4) representing a compromise between
the House bill and Senate amendment. The provision adds a limitation indicating that a trustee or debtor in
possession sell jointly owned property only if the property is not used in the production, transmission, or
distribution for sale, of electric energy or of natural or synthetic gas for heat, light, or power. This limitation is
[Release Point 118-106]
intended to protect public utilities from being deprived of power sources because of the bankruptcy of a joint
owner.
Section 363(k) of the House amendment is derived from the third sentence of section 363(e) of the Senate
amendment. The provision indicates that a secured creditor may bid in the full amount of the creditor's
allowed claim, including the secured portion and any unsecured portion thereof in the event the creditor is
undersecured, with respect to property that is subject to a lien that secures the allowed claim of the sale of the
property.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section defines the right and powers of the trustee with respect to the use, sale or lease of property and
the rights of other parties that have interests in the property involved. It applies in both liquidation and
reorganization cases.
Subsection (a) defines "cash collateral" as cash, negotiable instruments, documents of title, securities,
deposit accounts, or other cash equivalents in which the estate and an entity other than the estate have an
interest, such as a lien or a co-ownership interest. The definition is not restricted to property of the estate that
is cash collateral on the date of the filing of the petition. Thus, if "non-cash" collateral is disposed of and the
proceeds come within the definition of "cash collateral" as set forth in this subsection, the proceeds would be
cash collateral as long as they remain subject to the original lien on the "non-cash" collateral under section
552(b). To illustrate, rents received from real property before or after the commencement of the case would be
cash collateral to the extent that they are subject to a lien.
Subsection (b) permits the trustees to use, sell, or lease, other than in the ordinary course of business,
property of the estate upon notice and opportunity for objections and hearing thereon.
Subsection (c) governs use, sale, or lease in the ordinary course of business. If the business of the debtor is
authorized to be operated under §721, 1108, or 1304 of the bankruptcy code, then the trustee may use, sell, or
lease property in the ordinary course of business or enter into ordinary course transactions without need for
notice and hearing. This power is subject to several limitations. First, the court may restrict the trustee's
powers in the order authorizing operation of the business. Second, with respect to cash collateral, the trustee
may not use, sell, or lease cash collateral except upon court authorization after notice and a hearing, or with
the consent of each entity that has an interest in such cash collateral. The same preliminary hearing procedure
in the automatic stay section applies to a hearing under this subsection. In addition, the trustee is required to
segregate and account for any cash collateral in the trustee's possession, custody, or control.
Under subsections (d) and (e), the use, sale, or lease of property is further limited by the concept of
adequate protection. Sale, use, or lease of property in which an entity other than the estate has an interest may
be effected only to the extent not inconsistent with any relief from the stay granted to that interest's holder.
Moreover, the court may prohibit or condition the use, sale, or lease as is necessary to provide adequate
protection of that interest. Again, the trustee has the burden of proof on the issue of adequate protection.
Subsection (e) also provides that where a sale of the property is proposed, an entity that has an interest in such
property may bid at the sale thereof and set off against the purchase price up to the amount of such entity's
claim. No prior valuation under section 506(a) would limit this bidding right, since the bid at the sale would
be determinative of value.
Subsection (f) permits sale of property free and clear of any interest in the property of an entity other than
the estate. The trustee may sell free and clear if applicable nonbankruptcy law permits it, if the other entity
consents, if the interest is a lien and the sale price of the property is greater than the amount secured by the
lien, if the interest is in bona fide dispute, or if the other entity could be compelled to accept a money
satisfaction of the interest in a legal or equitable proceeding. Sale under this subsection is subject to the
adequate protection requirement. Most often, adequate protection in connection with a sale free and clear of
other interests will be to have those interests attach to the proceeds of the sale.
At a sale free and clear of other interests, any holder of any interest in the property being sold will be
permitted to bid. If that holder is the high bidder, he will be permitted to offset the value of his interest against
the purchase price of the property. Thus, in the most common situation, a holder of a lien on property being
sold may bid at the sale and, if successful, may offset the amount owed to him that is secured by the lien on
the property (but may not offset other amounts owed to him) against the purchase price, and be liable to the
trustee for the balance of the sale price, if any.
Subsection (g) permits the trustee to sell free and clear of any vested or contingent right in the nature of
dower or curtesy.
Subsection (h) permits sale of a co-owner's interest in property in which the debtor had an undivided
ownership interest such as a joint tenancy, a tenancy in common, or a tenancy by the entirety. Such a sale is
permissible only if partition is impracticable, if sale of the estate's interest would realize significantly less for
[Release Point 118-106]
the estate that sale of the property free of the interests of the co-owners, and if the benefit to the estate of such
a sale outweighs any detriment to the co-owners. This subsection does not apply to a co-owner's interest in a
public utility when a disruption of the utilities services could result.
Subsection (i) provides protections for co-owners and spouses with dower, curtesy, or community property
rights. It gives a right of first refusal to the co-owner or spouse at the price at which the sale is to be
consummated.
Subsection (j) requires the trustee to distribute to the spouse or co-owner the appropriate portion of the
proceeds of the sale, less certain administrative expenses.
Subsection (k) [enacted as (l)] permits the trustee to use, sell, or lease property notwithstanding certain
bankruptcy or ipso facto clauses that terminate the debtor's interest in the property or that work a forfeiture or
modification of that interest. This subsection is not as broad as the anti-ipso facto provision in proposed 11
U.S.C. 541(c)(1).
Subsection (l) [enacted as (m)] protects good faith purchasers of property sold under this section from a
reversal on appeal of the sale authorization, unless the authorization for the sale and the sale itself were stayed
pending appeal. The purchaser's knowledge of the appeal is irrelevant to the issue of good faith.
Subsection (m) [enacted as (n)] is directed at collusive bidding on property sold under this section. It
permits the trustee to void a sale if the price of the sale was controlled by an agreement among potential
bidders. The trustees may also recover the excess of the value of the property over the purchase price, and
may recover any costs, attorney's fees, or expenses incurred in voiding the sale or recovering the difference. In
addition, the court is authorized to grant judgment in favor of the estate and against the collusive bidder if the
agreement controlling the sale price was entered into in willful disregard of this subsection. The subsection
does not specify the precise measure of damages, but simply provides for punitive damages, to be fixed in
light of the circumstances.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 364(f) of the House amendment is new. This provision continues the exemption found in section
[Release Point 118-106]
3(a)(7) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(7)] for certificates of indebtedness issued by a trustee
in bankruptcy. The exemption applies to any debt security issued under section 364 of title 11. The section
does not intend to change present law which exempts such securities from the Trust Indenture Act, 15 U.S.C.
77aaa, et seq. (1976).
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section is derived from provisions in current law governing certificates of indebtedness, but is much
broader. It governs all obtaining of credit and incurring of debt by the estate.
Subsection (a) authorizes the obtaining of unsecured credit and the incurring of unsecured debt in the
ordinary course of business if the business of the debtor is authorized to be operated under section 721, 1108,
or 1304. The debts so incurred are allowable as administrative expenses under section 503(b)(1). The court
may limit the estate's ability to incur debt under this subsection.
Subsection (b) permits the court to authorize the trustee to obtain unsecured credit and incur unsecured
debts other than in the ordinary course of business, such as in order to wind up a liquidation case, or to obtain
a substantial loan in an operating case. Debt incurred under this subsection is allowable as an administrative
expense under section 503(b)(1).
Subsection (c) is closer to the concept of certificates of indebtedness in current law. It authorizes the
obtaining of credit and the incurring of debt with some special priority, if the trustee is unable to obtain
unsecured credit under subsection (a) or (b). The various priorities are (1) with priority over any or all
administrative expenses: (2) secured by a lien on unencumbered property of the estate; or (3) secured by a
junior lien on encumbered property. The priorities granted under this subsection do not interfere with existing
property rights.
Subsection (d) grants the court the authority to authorize the obtaining of credit and the incurring of debt
with a superiority, that is a lien on encumbered property that is senior or equal to the existing lien on the
property. The court may authorize such a superpriority only if the trustee is otherwise unable to obtain credit,
and if there is adequate protection of the original lien holder's interest. Again, the trustee has the burden of
proof on the issue of adequate protection.
Subsection (e) provides the same protection for credit extenders pending an appeal of an authorization to
incur debt as is provided under section 363(l) for purchasers: the credit is not affected on appeal by reversal of
the authorization and the incurring of the debt were stayed pending appeal. The protection runs to a good faith
lender, whether or not he knew of the pendency of the appeal.
A claim arising as a result of lending or borrowing under this section will be a priority claim, as defined in
proposed section 507(a)(1), even if the claim is granted a super-priority over administrative expenses and is to

§365. Executory contracts and unexpired leases
(a) Except as provided in sections 765 and 766 of this title and in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of
[Release Point 118-106]
this section, the trustee, subject to the court's approval, may assume or reject any executory contract
or unexpired lease of the debtor.
(b)(1) If there has been a default in an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor, the
trustee may not assume such contract or lease unless, at the time of assumption of such contract or
lease, the trustee—
(A) cures, or provides adequate assurance that the trustee will promptly cure, such default other
than a default that is a breach of a provision relating to the satisfaction of any provision (other than
a penalty rate or penalty provision) relating to a default arising from any failure to perform
nonmonetary obligations under an unexpired lease of real property, if it is impossible for the
trustee to cure such default by performing nonmonetary acts at and after the time of assumption,
except that if such default arises from a failure to operate in accordance with a nonresidential real
property lease, then such default shall be cured by performance at and after the time of assumption
in accordance with such lease, and pecuniary losses resulting from such default shall be
compensated in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph;
(B) compensates, or provides adequate assurance that the trustee will promptly compensate, a
party other than the debtor to such contract or lease, for any actual pecuniary loss to such party
resulting from such default; and
(C) provides adequate assurance of future performance under such contract or lease.
(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not apply to a default that is a breach of a provision
relating to—
(A) the insolvency or financial condition of the debtor at any time before the closing of the case;
(B) the commencement of a case under this title;
(C) the appointment of or taking possession by a trustee in a case under this title or a custodian
before such commencement; or
(D) the satisfaction of any penalty rate or penalty provision relating to a default arising from
any failure by the debtor to perform nonmonetary obligations under the executory contract or
unexpired lease.
(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection and paragraph (2)(B) of subsection (f),
adequate assurance of future performance of a lease of real property in a shopping center includes
adequate assurance—
(A) of the source of rent and other consideration due under such lease, and in the case of an
assignment, that the financial condition and operating performance of the proposed assignee and
its guarantors, if any, shall be similar to the financial condition and operating performance of the
debtor and its guarantors, if any, as of the time the debtor became the lessee under the lease;
(B) that any percentage rent due under such lease will not decline substantially;
(C) that assumption or assignment of such lease is subject to all the provisions thereof,
including (but not limited to) provisions such as a radius, location, use, or exclusivity provision,
and will not breach any such provision contained in any other lease, financing agreement, or
master agreement relating to such shopping center; and
(D) that assumption or assignment of such lease will not disrupt any tenant mix or balance in
such shopping center.
(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if there has been a default in an unexpired
lease of the debtor, other than a default of a kind specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the
trustee may not require a lessor to provide services or supplies incidental to such lease before
assumption of such lease unless the lessor is compensated under the terms of such lease for any
services and supplies provided under such lease before assumption of such lease.
(c) The trustee may not assume or assign any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor,
whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or delegation of
duties, if—
(1)(A) applicable law excuses a party, other than the debtor, to such contract or lease from
[Release Point 118-106]
accepting performance from or rendering performance to an entity other than the debtor or the
debtor in possession, whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of
rights or delegation of duties; and
(B) such party does not consent to such assumption or assignment; or
(2) such contract is a contract to make a loan, or extend other debt financing or financial
accommodations, to or for the benefit of the debtor, or to issue a security of the debtor; or
(3) such lease is of nonresidential real property and has been terminated under applicable
nonbankruptcy law prior to the order for relief.
(d)(1) In a case under chapter 7 of this title, if the trustee does not assume or reject an executory
contract or unexpired lease of residential real property or of personal property of the debtor within 60
days after the order for relief, or within such additional time as the court, for cause, within such
60-day period, fixes, then such contract or lease is deemed rejected.
(2) In a case under chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13 of this title, the trustee may assume or reject an
executory contract or unexpired lease of residential real property or of personal property of the
debtor at any time before the confirmation of a plan but the court, on the request of any party to such
contract or lease, may order the trustee to determine within a specified period of time whether to
assume or reject such contract or lease.
(3) The trustee shall timely perform all the obligations of the debtor, except those specified in
section 365(b)(2), arising from and after the order for relief under any unexpired lease of
nonresidential real property, until such lease is assumed or rejected, notwithstanding section
503(b)(1) of this title. The court may extend, for cause, the time for performance of any such
obligation that arises within 60 days after the date of the order for relief, but the time for
performance shall not be extended beyond such 60-day period. This subsection shall not be deemed
to affect the trustee's obligations under the provisions of subsection (b) or (f) of this section.
Acceptance of any such performance does not constitute waiver or relinquishment of the lessor's
rights under such lease or under this title.
(4)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), an unexpired lease of nonresidential real property under which
the debtor is the lessee shall be deemed rejected, and the trustee shall immediately surrender that
nonresidential real property to the lessor, if the trustee does not assume or reject the unexpired lease
by the earlier of—
(i) the date that is 120 days after the date of the order for relief; or
(ii) the date of the entry of an order confirming a plan.
(B)(i) The court may extend the period determined under subparagraph (A), prior to the expiration
of the 120-day period, for 90 days on the motion of the trustee or lessor for cause.
(ii) If the court grants an extension under clause (i), the court may grant a subsequent extension
only upon prior written consent of the lessor in each instance.
(5) The trustee shall timely perform all of the obligations of the debtor, except those specified in
section 365(b)(2), first arising from or after 60 days after the order for relief in a case under chapter
11 of this title under an unexpired lease of personal property (other than personal property leased to
an individual primarily for personal, family, or household purposes), until such lease is assumed or
rejected notwithstanding section 503(b)(1) of this title, unless the court, after notice and a hearing
and based on the equities of the case, orders otherwise with respect to the obligations or timely
performance thereof. This subsection shall not be deemed to affect the trustee's obligations under the
provisions of subsection (b) or (f). Acceptance of any such performance does not constitute waiver or
relinquishment of the lessor's rights under such lease or under this title.
(e)(1) Notwithstanding a provision in an executory contract or unexpired lease, or in applicable
law, an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor may not be terminated or modified, and
any right or obligation under such contract or lease may not be terminated or modified, at any time
after the commencement of the case solely because of a provision in such contract or lease that is
conditioned on—
(A) the insolvency or financial condition of the debtor at any time before the closing of the case;
[Release Point 118-106]
(B) the commencement of a case under this title; or
(C) the appointment of or taking possession by a trustee in a case under this title or a custodian
before such commencement.
(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not apply to an executory contract or unexpired lease of
the debtor, whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or
delegation of duties, if—
(A)(i) applicable law excuses a party, other than the debtor, to such contract or lease from
accepting performance from or rendering performance to the trustee or to an assignee of such
contract or lease, whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or
delegation of duties; and
(ii) such party does not consent to such assumption or assignment; or
(B) such contract is a contract to make a loan, or extend other debt financing or financial
accommodations, to or for the benefit of the debtor, or to issue a security of the debtor.
(f)(1) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, notwithstanding a provision in
an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor, or in applicable law, that prohibits, restricts,
or conditions the assignment of such contract or lease, the trustee may assign such contract or lease
under paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(2) The trustee may assign an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor only if—
(A) the trustee assumes such contract or lease in accordance with the provisions of this section;
and
(B) adequate assurance of future performance by the assignee of such contract or lease is
provided, whether or not there has been a default in such contract or lease.
(3) Notwithstanding a provision in an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor, or in
applicable law that terminates or modifies, or permits a party other than the debtor to terminate or
modify, such contract or lease or a right or obligation under such contract or lease on account of an
assignment of such contract or lease, such contract, lease, right, or obligation may not be terminated
or modified under such provision because of the assumption or assignment of such contract or lease
by the trustee.
(g) Except as provided in subsections (h)(2) and (i)(2) of this section, the rejection of an executory
contract or unexpired lease of the debtor constitutes a breach of such contract or lease—
(1) if such contract or lease has not been assumed under this section or under a plan confirmed
under chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13 of this title, immediately before the date of the filing of the petition;
or
(2) if such contract or lease has been assumed under this section or under a plan confirmed
under chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13 of this title—
(A) if before such rejection the case has not been converted under section 1112, 1208, or
1307 of this title, at the time of such rejection; or
(B) if before such rejection the case has been converted under section 1112, 1208, or 1307 of
this title—
(i) immediately before the date of such conversion, if such contract or lease was assumed
before such conversion; or
(ii) at the time of such rejection, if such contract or lease was assumed after such
conversion.
(h)(1)(A) If the trustee rejects an unexpired lease of real property under which the debtor is the
lessor and—
(i) if the rejection by the trustee amounts to such a breach as would entitle the lessee to treat
such lease as terminated by virtue of its terms, applicable nonbankruptcy law, or any agreement
made by the lessee, then the lessee under such lease may treat such lease as terminated by the
rejection; or
[Release Point 118-106]
(ii) if the term of such lease has commenced, the lessee may retain its rights under such lease
(including rights such as those relating to the amount and timing of payment of rent and other
amounts payable by the lessee and any right of use, possession, quiet enjoyment, subletting,
assignment, or hypothecation) that are in or appurtenant to the real property for the balance of the
term of such lease and for any renewal or extension of such rights to the extent that such rights are
enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law.
(B) If the lessee retains its rights under subparagraph (A)(ii), the lessee may offset against the rent
reserved under such lease for the balance of the term after the date of the rejection of such lease and
for the term of any renewal or extension of such lease, the value of any damage caused by the
nonperformance after the date of such rejection, of any obligation of the debtor under such lease, but
the lessee shall not have any other right against the estate or the debtor on account of any damage
occurring after such date caused by such nonperformance.
(C) The rejection of a lease of real property in a shopping center with respect to which the lessee
elects to retain its rights under subparagraph (A)(ii) does not affect the enforceability under
applicable nonbankruptcy law of any provision in the lease pertaining to radius, location, use,
exclusivity, or tenant mix or balance.
(D) In this paragraph, "lessee" includes any successor, assign, or mortgagee permitted under the
terms of such lease.
(2)(A) If the trustee rejects a timeshare interest under a timeshare plan under which the debtor is
the timeshare interest seller and—
(i) if the rejection amounts to such a breach as would entitle the timeshare interest purchaser to
treat the timeshare plan as terminated under its terms, applicable nonbankruptcy law, or any
agreement made by timeshare interest purchaser, the timeshare interest purchaser under the
timeshare plan may treat the timeshare plan as terminated by such rejection; or
(ii) if the term of such timeshare interest has commenced, then the timeshare interest purchaser
may retain its rights in such timeshare interest for the balance of such term and for any term of
renewal or extension of such timeshare interest to the extent that such rights are enforceable under
applicable nonbankruptcy law.
(B) If the timeshare interest purchaser retains its rights under subparagraph (A), such timeshare
interest purchaser may offset against the moneys due for such timeshare interest for the balance of
the term after the date of the rejection of such timeshare interest, and the term of any renewal or
extension of such timeshare interest, the value of any damage caused by the nonperformance after
the date of such rejection, of any obligation of the debtor under such timeshare plan, but the
timeshare interest purchaser shall not have any right against the estate or the debtor on account of
any damage occurring after such date caused by such nonperformance.
(i)(1) If the trustee rejects an executory contract of the debtor for the sale of real property or for
the sale of a timeshare interest under a timeshare plan, under which the purchaser is in possession,
such purchaser may treat such contract as terminated, or, in the alternative, may remain in possession
of such real property or timeshare interest.
(2) If such purchaser remains in possession—
(A) such purchaser shall continue to make all payments due under such contract, but may, offset
against such payments any damages occurring after the date of the rejection of such contract
caused by the nonperformance of any obligation of the debtor after such date, but such purchaser
does not have any rights against the estate on account of any damages arising after such date from
such rejection, other than such offset; and
(B) the trustee shall deliver title to such purchaser in accordance with the provisions of such
contract, but is relieved of all other obligations to perform under such contract.
(j) A purchaser that treats an executory contract as terminated under subsection (i) of this section,
or a party whose executory contract to purchase real property from the debtor is rejected and under
which such party is not in possession, has a lien on the interest of the debtor in such property for the
[Release Point 118-106]
recovery of any portion of the purchase price that such purchaser or party has paid.
(k) Assignment by the trustee to an entity of a contract or lease assumed under this section relieves
the trustee and the estate from any liability for any breach of such contract or lease occurring after
such assignment.
(l) If an unexpired lease under which the debtor is the lessee is assigned pursuant to this section,
the lessor of the property may require a deposit or other security for the performance of the debtor's
obligations under the lease substantially the same as would have been required by the landlord upon
the initial leasing to a similar tenant.
(m) For purposes of this section 365 and sections 541(b)(2) and 362(b)(10), leases of real property
shall include any rental agreement to use real property.
(n)(1) If the trustee rejects an executory contract under which the debtor is a licensor of a right to
intellectual property, the licensee under such contract may elect—
(A) to treat such contract as terminated by such rejection if such rejection by the trustee
amounts to such a breach as would entitle the licensee to treat such contract as terminated by
virtue of its own terms, applicable nonbankruptcy law, or an agreement made by the licensee with
another entity; or
(B) to retain its rights (including a right to enforce any exclusivity provision of such contract,
but excluding any other right under applicable nonbankruptcy law to specific performance of such
contract) under such contract and under any agreement supplementary to such contract, to such
intellectual property (including any embodiment of such intellectual property to the extent
protected by applicable nonbankruptcy law), as such rights existed immediately before the case
commenced, for—
(i) the duration of such contract; and
(ii) any period for which such contract may be extended by the licensee as of right under
applicable nonbankruptcy law.
(2) If the licensee elects to retain its rights, as described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection,
under such contract—
(A) the trustee shall allow the licensee to exercise such rights;
(B) the licensee shall make all royalty payments due under such contract for the duration of
such contract and for any period described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection for which the
licensee extends such contract; and
(C) the licensee shall be deemed to waive—
(i) any right of setoff it may have with respect to such contract under this title or applicable
nonbankruptcy law; and
(ii) any claim allowable under section 503(b) of this title arising from the performance of
such contract.
(3) If the licensee elects to retain its rights, as described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection,
then on the written request of the licensee the trustee shall—
(A) to the extent provided in such contract, or any agreement supplementary to such contract,
provide to the licensee any intellectual property (including such embodiment) held by the trustee;
and
(B) not interfere with the rights of the licensee as provided in such contract, or any agreement
supplementary to such contract, to such intellectual property (including such embodiment)
including any right to obtain such intellectual property (or such embodiment) from another entity.
(4) Unless and until the trustee rejects such contract, on the written request of the licensee the
trustee shall—
(A) to the extent provided in such contract or any agreement supplementary to such contract—
(i) perform such contract; or
(ii) provide to the licensee such intellectual property (including any embodiment of such
intellectual property to the extent protected by applicable nonbankruptcy law) held by the
[Release Point 118-106]
trustee; and
(B) not interfere with the rights of the licensee as provided in such contract, or any agreement
supplementary to such contract, to such intellectual property (including such embodiment),
including any right to obtain such intellectual property (or such embodiment) from another entity.
(o) In a case under chapter 11 of this title, the trustee shall be deemed to have assumed (consistent
with the debtor's other obligations under section 507), and shall immediately cure any deficit under,
any commitment by the debtor to a Federal depository institutions regulatory agency (or predecessor
to such agency) to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution, and any claim for a
subsequent breach of the obligations thereunder shall be entitled to priority under section 507. This
subsection shall not extend any commitment that would otherwise be terminated by any act of such
an agency.
(p)(1) If a lease of personal property is rejected or not timely assumed by the trustee under
subsection (d), the leased property is no longer property of the estate and the stay under section
362(a) is automatically terminated.
(2)(A) If the debtor in a case under chapter 7 is an individual, the debtor may notify the creditor in
writing that the debtor desires to assume the lease. Upon being so notified, the creditor may, at its
option, notify the debtor that it is willing to have the lease assumed by the debtor and may condition
such assumption on cure of any outstanding default on terms set by the contract.
(B) If, not later than 30 days after notice is provided under subparagraph (A), the debtor notifies
the lessor in writing that the lease is assumed, the liability under the lease will be assumed by the
debtor and not by the estate.
(C) The stay under section 362 and the injunction under section 524(a)(2) shall not be violated by
notification of the debtor and negotiation of cure under this subsection.
(3) In a case under chapter 11 in which the debtor is an individual and in a case under chapter 13,
if the debtor is the lessee with respect to personal property and the lease is not assumed in the plan
confirmed by the court, the lease is deemed rejected as of the conclusion of the hearing on
confirmation. If the lease is rejected, the stay under section 362 and any stay under section 1301 is
automatically terminated with respect to the property subject to the lease.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 365(b)(3) represents a compromise between H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate
amendment. The provision adopts standards contained in section 365(b)(5) of the Senate amendment to define
adequate assurance of future performance of a lease of real property in a shopping center.
Section 365(b)(4) of the House amendment indicates that after default the trustee may not require a lessor to
supply services or materials without assumption unless the lessor is compensated as provided in the lease.
Section 365(c)(2) and (3) likewise represent a compromise between H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and
the Senate amendment. Section 365(c)(2) is derived from section 365(b)(4) of the Senate amendment but does
not apply to a contract to deliver equipment as provided in the Senate amendment. As contained in the House
amendment, the provision prohibits a trustee or debtor in possession from assuming or assigning an executory
contract of the debtor to make a loan, or extend other debt financing or financial accommodations, to or for
the benefit of the debtor, or the issuance of a security of the debtor.
Section 365(e) is a refinement of comparable provisions contained in the House bill and Senate amendment.
Sections 365(e)(1) and (2)(A) restate section 365(e) of H.R. 8200 as passed by the House. Sections
[Release Point 118-106]
365(e)(2)(B) expands the section to permit termination of an executory contract or unexpired lease of the
debtor if such contract is a contract to make a loan, or extend other debt financing or financial
accommodations, to or for the benefit of the debtor, or for the issuance of a security of the debtor.
Characterization of contracts to make a loan, or extend other debt financing or financial accommodations, is
limited to the extension of cash or a line of credit and is not intended to embrace ordinary leases or contracts
to provide goods or services with payments to be made over time.
Section 365(f) is derived from H.R. 8200 as passed by the House. Deletion of language in section 365(f)(3)
of the Senate amendment is done as a matter of style. Restrictions with respect to assignment of an executory
contract or unexpired lease are superfluous since the debtor may assign an executory contract or unexpired
lease of the debtor only if such contract is first assumed under section 364(f)(2)(A) of the House amendment.
Section 363(h) of the House amendment represents a modification of section 365(h) of the Senate
amendment. The House amendment makes clear that in the case of a bankrupt lessor, a lessee may remain in
possession for the balance of the term of a lease and any renewal or extension of the term only to the extent
that such renewal or extension may be obtained by the lessee without the permission of the landlord or some
third party under applicable non-bankruptcy law.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) of this section authorizes the trustee, subject to the court's approval, to assume or reject an
executory contract or unexpired lease. Though there is no precise definition of what contracts are executory, it
generally includes contracts on which performance remains due to some extent on both sides. A note is not
usually an executory contract if the only performance that remains is repayment. Performance on one side of
the contract would have been completed and the contract is no longer executory.
Because of the volatile nature of the commodities markets and the special provisions governing commodity
broker liquidations in subchapter IV of chapter 7, the provisions governing distribution in section 765(a) will
govern if any conflict between those provisions and the provisions of this section arise.
Subsections (b), (c), and (d) provide limitations on the trustee's powers. Subsection (b) requires the trustee
to cure any default in the contract or lease and to provide adequate assurance of future performance if there
has been a default, before he may assume. This provision does not apply to defaults under ipso facto or
bankruptcy clauses, which is a significant departure from present law.
Subsection (b)(3) permits termination of leases entered into prior to the effective date of this title in
liquidation cases if certain other conditions are met.
Subsection (b)(4) [enacted as (c)(2)] prohibits the trustee's assumption of an executory contract requiring
the other party to make a loan or deliver equipment to or to issue a security of the debtor. The purpose of this
subsection is to make it clear that a party to a transaction which is based upon the financial strength of a
debtor should not be required to extend new credit to the debtor whether in the form of loans, lease financing,
or the purchase or discount of notes.
Subsection (b)(5) provides that in lease situations common to shopping centers, protections must be
provided for the lessor if the trustee assumes the lease, including protection against decline in percentage
rents, breach of agreements with other tenants, and preservation of the tenant mix. Protection for tenant mix
will not be required in the office building situation.
Subsection (c) prohibits the trustee from assuming or assigning a contract or lease if applicable
nonbankruptcy law excuses the other party from performance to someone other than the debtor, unless the
other party consents. This prohibition applies only in the situation in which applicable law excuses the other
party from performance independent of any restrictive language in the contract or lease itself.
Subsection (d) places time limits on assumption and rejection. In a liquidation case, the trustee must assume
within 60 days (or within an additional 60 days, if the court, for cause, extends the time). If not assumed, the
contract or lease is deemed rejected. In a rehabilitation case, the time limit is not fixed in the bill. However, if
the other party to the contract or lease requests the court to fix a time, the court may specify a time within
which the trustee must act. This provision will prevent parties in contractual or lease relationships with the
debtor from being left in doubt concerning their status vis-a-vis the estate.
Subsection (e) invalidates ipso facto or bankruptcy clauses. These clauses, protected under present law,
automatically terminate the contract or lease, or permit the other contracting party to terminate the contract or
lease, in the event of bankruptcy. This frequently hampers rehabilitation efforts. If the trustee may assume or
assign the contract under the limitations imposed by the remainder of the section, the contract or lease may be
utilized to assist in the debtor's rehabilitation or liquidation.
The unenforcibility [sic] of ipso facto or bankruptcy clauses proposed under this section will require the
courts to be sensitive to the rights of the nondebtor party to executory contracts and unexpired leases. If the
trustee is to assume a contract or lease, the court will have to insure that the trustee's performance under the
[Release Point 118-106]
contract or lease gives the other contracting party the full benefit of his bargain.
This subsection does not limit the application of an ipso facto or bankruptcy clause if a new insolvency or
receivership occurs after the bankruptcy case is closed. That is, the clause is not invalidated in toto, but merely
made inapplicable during the case for the purposes of disposition of the executory contract or unexpired lease.
Subsection (f) partially invalidates restrictions on assignment of contracts or leases by the trustee to a third
party. The subsection imposes two restrictions on the trustee: he must first assume the contract or lease,
subject to all the restrictions on assumption found in the section, and adequate assurance of future
performance must be provided to the other contracting party. Paragraph (3) of the subsection invalidates
contractual provisions that permit termination or modification in the event of an assignment, as contrary to the
policy of this subsection.
Subsection (g) defines the time as of which a rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease
constitutes a breach of the contract or lease. Generally, the breach is as of the date immediately preceding the
date of the petition. The purpose is to treat rejection claims as prepetition claims. The remainder of the
subsection specifies different times for cases that are converted from one chapter to another. The provisions of
this subsection are not a substantive authorization to breach or reject an assumed contract. Rather, they
prescribe the rules for the allowance of claims in case an assumed contract is breached, or if a case under
chapter 11 in which a contract has been assumed is converted to a case under chapter 7 in which the contract
is rejected.
Subsection (h) protects real property lessees of the debtor if the trustee rejects an unexpired lease under
which the debtor is the lessor (or sublessor). The subsection permits the lessee to remain in possession of the
leased property or to treat the lease as terminated by the rejection. The balance of the term of the lease referred
to in paragraph (1) will include any renewal terms that are enforceable by the tenant, but not renewal terms if
the landlord had an option to terminate. Thus, the tenant will not be deprived of his estate for the term for
which he bargained. If the lessee remains in possession, he may offset the rent reserved under the lease against
damages caused by the rejection, but does not have any affirmative rights against the estate for any damages
after the rejection that result from the rejection.
Subsection (i) gives a purchaser of real property under a land installment sales contract similar protection.
The purchaser, if the contract is rejected, may remain in possession or may treat the contract as terminated. If
the purchaser remains in possession, he is required to continue to make the payments due, but may offset
damages that occur after rejection. The trustee is required to deliver title, but is relieved of all other
obligations to perform.
A purchaser that treats the contract as terminated is granted a lien on the property to the extent of the
purchase price paid. A party with a contract to purchase land from the debtor has a lien on the property to
secure the price already paid, if the contract is rejected and the purchaser is not yet in possession.
Subsection (k) relieves the trustee and the estate of liability for a breach of an assigned contract or lease that
occurs after the assignment.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (c) prohibits the trustee from assuming or assigning a contract or lease if applicable
nonbankruptcy law excuses the other party from performance to someone other than the debtor, unless the
other party consents. This prohibition applies only in the situation in which applicable law excuses the other
party from performance independent of any restrictive language in the contract or lease itself. The purpose of
this subsection, at least in part, is to prevent the trustee from requiring new advances of money or other
property. The section permits the trustee to continue to use and pay for property already advanced, but is not
designed to permit the trustee to demand new loans or additional transfers of property under lease
commitments.
Thus, under this provision, contracts such as loan commitments and letters of credit are nonassignable, and
may not be assumed by the trustee.
Subsection (e) invalidates ipso facto or bankruptcy clauses. These clauses, protected under present law,
automatically terminate the contract or lease, or permit the other contracting party to terminate the contract or
lease, in the event of bankruptcy. This frequently hampers rehabilitation efforts. If the trustee may assume or
assign the contract under the limitations imposed by the remainder of the section, then the contract or lease
may be utilized to assist in the debtor's rehabilitation or liquidation.
The unenforceability of ipso facto or bankruptcy clauses proposed under this section will require the courts
to be sensitive to the rights of the nondebtor party to executory contracts and unexpired leases. If the trustee is
to assume a contract or lease, the courts will have to insure that the trustee's performance under the contract or
[Release Point 118-106]
lease gives the other contracting party the full benefit of his bargain. An example of the complexity that may
arise in these situations and the need for a determination of all aspects of a particular executory contract or
unexpired lease is the shopping center lease under which the debtor is a tenant in a shopping center.
A shopping center is often a carefully planned enterprise, and though it consists of numerous individual
tenants, the center is planned as a single unit, often subject to a master lease or financing agreement. Under
these agreements, the tenant mix in a shopping center may be as important to the lessor as the actual promised
rental payments, because certain mixes will attract higher patronage of the stores in the center, and thus a
higher rental for the landlord from those stores that are subject to a percentage of gross receipts rental
agreement. Thus, in order to assure a landlord of his bargained for exchange, the court would have to consider
such factors as the nature of the business to be conducted by the trustee or his assignee, whether that business
complies with the requirements of any master agreement, whether the kind of business proposed will generate
gross sales in an amount such that the percentage rent specified in the lease is substantially the same as what
would have been provided by the debtor, and whether the business proposed to be conducted would result in a
breach of other clauses in master agreements relating, for example, to tenant mix and location.
This subsection does not limit the application of an ipso facto or bankruptcy clause to a new insolvency or
receivership after the bankruptcy case is closed. That is, the clause is not invalidated in toto, but merely made
inapplicable during the case for the purpose of disposition of the executory contract or unexpired lease.

lessor, or a timeshare interest under a timeshare plan under which the debtor is the timeshare interest seller,
the lessee or timeshare interest purchaser under such lease or timeshare plan may treat such lease or timeshare
plan as terminated by such rejection, where the disaffirmance by the trustee amounts to such a breach as
would entitle the lessee or timeshare interest purchaser to treat such lease or timeshare plan as terminated by
virtue of its own terms, applicable nonbankruptcy law, or other agreements the lessee or timeshare interest
purchaser has made with other parties; or, in the alternative, the lessee or timeshare interest purchaser may

lessor, the lessee under such lease may treat the lease as terminated by such rejection, or, in the alternative,
may remain in possession for the balance of the term of such lease and any renewal or extension of such term
that is enforceable by such lessee under applicable nonbankruptcy law."
Subsec. (h)(2). Pub. L. 98–353, §403, amended par. (2) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (2) read as

lease for the balance of the term after the date of the rejection of such lease, and any such renewal or
extension, any damages occurring after such date caused by the nonperformance of any obligation of the
debtor after such date, but such lessee does not have any rights against the estate on account of any damages
arising after such date from such rejection, other than such offset."
Subsec. (i)(1). Pub. L. 98–353, §404, amended par. (1) generally, inserting provisions relating to timeshare

"(3) it is important that such airports be empowered to continue service in the event of such a
disruption."
§366. Utility service
(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, a utility may not alter, refuse, or
discontinue service to, or discriminate against, the trustee or the debtor solely on the basis of the
commencement of a case under this title or that a debt owed by the debtor to such utility for service
rendered before the order for relief was not paid when due.
(b) Such utility may alter, refuse, or discontinue service if neither the trustee nor the debtor, within
20 days after the date of the order for relief, furnishes adequate assurance of payment, in the form of
a deposit or other security, for service after such date. On request of a party in interest and after
notice and a hearing, the court may order reasonable modification of the amount of the deposit or
other security necessary to provide adequate assurance of payment.
(c)(1)(A) For purposes of this subsection, the term "assurance of payment" means—
(i) a cash deposit;
(ii) a letter of credit;
(iii) a certificate of deposit;
(iv) a surety bond;
(v) a prepayment of utility consumption; or
(vi) another form of security that is mutually agreed on between the utility and the debtor or the
trustee.
(B) For purposes of this subsection an administrative expense priority shall not constitute an
[Release Point 118-106]
assurance of payment.
(2) Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), with respect to a case filed under chapter 11, a utility
referred to in subsection (a) may alter, refuse, or discontinue utility service, if during the 30-day
period beginning on the date of the filing of the petition, the utility does not receive from the debtor
or the trustee adequate assurance of payment for utility service that is satisfactory to the utility.
(3)(A) On request of a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court may order
modification of the amount of an assurance of payment under paragraph (2).
(B) In making a determination under this paragraph whether an assurance of payment is adequate,
the court may not consider—
(i) the absence of security before the date of the filing of the petition;
(ii) the payment by the debtor of charges for utility service in a timely manner before the date of
the filing of the petition; or
(iii) the availability of an administrative expense priority.
(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with respect to a case subject to this subsection, a
utility may recover or set off against a security deposit provided to the utility by the debtor before the
date of the filing of the petition without notice or order of the court.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 366 of the House amendment represents a compromise between comparable provisions contained in
H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate amendment. Subsection (a) is modified so that the
applicable date is the date of the order for relief rather than the date of the filing of the petition. Subsection (b)
contains a similar change but is otherwise derived from section 366(b) of the Senate amendment, with the
exception that a time period for continued service of 20 days rather than 10 days is adopted.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section gives debtors protection from a cut-off of service by a utility because of the filing of a
bankruptcy case. This section is intended to cover utilities that have some special position with respect to the
debtor, such as an electric company, gas supplier, or telephone company that is a monopoly in the area so that
the debtor cannot easily obtain comparable service from another utility. The utility may not alter, refuse, or
discontinue service because of the nonpayment of a bill that would be discharged in the bankruptcy case.
Subsection (b) protects the utility company by requiring the trustee or the debtor to provide, within ten days,
adequate assurance of payment for service provided after the date of the petition.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
The House amendment adopts section 501(b) of the Senate amendment leaving the Rules of Bankruptcy
Procedure free to determine where a proof of claim must be filed.
Section 501(c) expands language contained in section 501(c) of the House bill and Senate amendment to
permit the debtor to file a proof of claim if a creditor does not timely file a proof of the creditor's claim in a
case under title 11.
The House amendment deletes section 501(e) of the Senate amendment as a matter to be left to the rules of
bankruptcy procedure. It is anticipated that the rules will enable governmental units, like other creditors, to
have a reasonable time to file proofs of claim in bankruptcy cases.
For purposes of section 501, a proof of "interest" includes the interest of a general or limited partner in a
partnership, the interest of a proprietor in a sole proprietorship, or the interest of a common or preferred
stockholder in a corporation.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section governs the means by which creditors and equity security holders present their claims or
interests to the court. Subsection (a) permits a creditor to file a proof of claim or interest. An indenture trustee
representing creditors may file a proof of claim on behalf of the creditors he represents.
This subsection is permissive only, and does not require filing of a proof of claim by any creditor. It permits
filing where some purpose would be served, such as where a claim that appears on a list filed under proposed
11 U.S.C. 924 or 1111 was incorrectly stated or listed as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated, where a
creditor with a lien is undersecured and asserts a claim for the balance of the debt owed him (his unsecured
claim, as determined under proposed 11 U.S.C. 506(a)), or in a liquidation case where there will be a
distribution of assets to the holders of allowed claims. In other instances, such as in no-asset liquidation cases,
in situations where a secured creditor does not assert any claim against the estate and a determination of his
claim is not made under proposed 11 U.S.C. 506, or in situations where the claim asserted would be
subordinated and the creditor would not recover from the estate in any event, filing of a proof of claim may
simply not be necessary. The Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and practice under the law will guide creditors
as to when filing is necessary and when it may be dispensed with. In general, however, unless a claim is listed
in a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case and allowed as a result of the list, a proof of claim will be a prerequisite to
allowance for unsecured claims, including priority claims and the unsecured portion of a claim asserted by the
holder of a lien.
The Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure will set the time limits, the form, and the procedure for filing, which
will determine whether claims are timely or tardily filed. The rules governing time limits for filing proofs of
claims will continue to apply under section 405(d) of the bill. These provide a 6-month-bar date for the filing
of tax claims.
Subsection (b) permits a codebtor, surety, or guarantor to file a proof of claim on behalf of the creditor to
which he is liable if the creditor does not timely file a proof of claim.
In liquidation and individual repayment plan cases, the trustee or the debtor may file a proof of claim under
subsection (c) if the creditor does not timely file. The purpose of this subsection is mainly to protect the debtor
if the creditor's claim is nondischargeable. If the creditor does not file, there would be no distribution on the
claim, and the debtor would have a greater debt to repay after the case is closed than if the claim were paid in
part or in full in the case or under the plan.
Subsection (d) governs the filing of claims of the kind specified in subsections (f), (g), (h), (i), or (j) of
proposed 11 U.S.C. 502. The separation of this provision from the other claim-filing provisions in this section
is intended to indicate that claims of the kind specified, which do not become fixed or do not arise until after
the commencement of the case, must be treated differently for filing purposes such as the bar date for filing
claims. The rules will provide for later filing of claims of these kinds.
Subsection (e) gives governmental units (including tax authorities) at least six months following the date for
the first meeting of creditors in a chapter 7 or chapter 13 case within which to file proof of claims.

court that contains information detailing the child support debt, its status, and other characteristics."
§502. Allowance of claims or interests
(a) A claim or interest, proof of which is filed under section 501 of this title, is deemed allowed,
unless a party in interest, including a creditor of a general partner in a partnership that is a debtor in a
case under chapter 7 of this title, objects.
(b) Except as provided in subsections (e)(2), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of this section, if such objection to
a claim is made, the court, after notice and a hearing, shall determine the amount of such claim in
lawful currency of the United States as of the date of the filing of the petition, and shall allow such
claim in such amount, except to the extent that—
(1) such claim is unenforceable against the debtor and property of the debtor, under any
agreement or applicable law for a reason other than because such claim is contingent or
unmatured;
(2) such claim is for unmatured interest;
(3) if such claim is for a tax assessed against property of the estate, such claim exceeds the
value of the interest of the estate in such property;
(4) if such claim is for services of an insider or attorney of the debtor, such claim exceeds the
reasonable value of such services;
(5) such claim is for a debt that is unmatured on the date of the filing of the petition and that is
excepted from discharge under section 523(a)(5) of this title;
(6) if such claim is the claim of a lessor for damages resulting from the termination of a lease of
real property, such claim exceeds—
(A) the rent reserved by such lease, without acceleration, for the greater of one year, or 15
percent, not to exceed three years, of the remaining term of such lease, following the earlier
[Release Point 118-106]
of—
(i) the date of the filing of the petition; and
(ii) the date on which such lessor repossessed, or the lessee surrendered, the leased
property; plus
(B) any unpaid rent due under such lease, without acceleration, on the earlier of such dates;
(7) if such claim is the claim of an employee for damages resulting from the termination of an
employment contract, such claim exceeds—
(A) the compensation provided by such contract, without acceleration, for one year following
the earlier of—
(i) the date of the filing of the petition; or
(ii) the date on which the employer directed the employee to terminate, or such employee
terminated, performance under such contract; plus
(B) any unpaid compensation due under such contract, without acceleration, on the earlier of
such dates;
(8) such claim results from a reduction, due to late payment, in the amount of an otherwise
applicable credit available to the debtor in connection with an employment tax on wages, salaries,
or commissions earned from the debtor; or
(9) proof of such claim is not timely filed, except to the extent tardily filed as permitted under
paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of section 726(a) or under the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure,
except that—
(A) a claim of a governmental unit shall be timely filed if it is filed before 180 days after the
date of the order for relief or such later time as the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure may
provide; and
(B) in a case under chapter 13, a claim of a governmental unit for a tax with respect to a
return filed under section 1308 shall be timely if the claim is filed on or before the date that is
60 days after the date on which such return was filed as required.
(c) There shall be estimated for purpose of allowance under this section—
(1) any contingent or unliquidated claim, the fixing or liquidation of which, as the case may be,
would unduly delay the administration of the case; or
(2) any right to payment arising from a right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance.
(d) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the court shall disallow any claim of
any entity from which property is recoverable under section 542, 543, 550, or 553 of this title or that
is a transferee of a transfer avoidable under section 522(f), 522(h), 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, or 724(a)
of this title, unless such entity or transferee has paid the amount, or turned over any such property,
for which such entity or transferee is liable under section 522(i), 542, 543, 550, or 553 of this title.
(e)(1) Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section and paragraph (2) of this
subsection, the court shall disallow any claim for reimbursement or contribution of an entity that is
liable with the debtor on or has secured the claim of a creditor, to the extent that—
(A) such creditor's claim against the estate is disallowed;
(B) such claim for reimbursement or contribution is contingent as of the time of allowance or
disallowance of such claim for reimbursement or contribution; or
(C) such entity asserts a right of subrogation to the rights of such creditor under section 509 of
this title.
(2) A claim for reimbursement or contribution of such an entity that becomes fixed after the
commencement of the case shall be determined, and shall be allowed under subsection (a), (b), or (c)
of this section, or disallowed under subsection (d) of this section, the same as if such claim had
[Release Point 118-106]
become fixed before the date of the filing of the petition.
(f) In an involuntary case, a claim arising in the ordinary course of the debtor's business or
financial affairs after the commencement of the case but before the earlier of the appointment of a
trustee and the order for relief shall be determined as of the date such claim arises, and shall be
allowed under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section or disallowed under subsection (d) or (e) of
this section, the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition.
(g)(1) A claim arising from the rejection, under section 365 of this title or under a plan under
chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13 of this title, of an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor that has
not been assumed shall be determined, and shall be allowed under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this
section or disallowed under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, the same as if such claim had arisen
before the date of the filing of the petition.
(2) A claim for damages calculated in accordance with section 562 shall be allowed under
subsection (a), (b), or (c), or disallowed under subsection (d) or (e), as if such claim had arisen
before the date of the filing of the petition.
(h) A claim arising from the recovery of property under section 522, 550, or 553 of this title shall
be determined, and shall be allowed under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section, or disallowed
under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the
filing of the petition.
(i) A claim that does not arise until after the commencement of the case for a tax entitled to
priority under section 507(a)(8) of this title shall be determined, and shall be allowed under
subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section, or disallowed under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, the
same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition.
(j) A claim that has been allowed or disallowed may be reconsidered for cause. A reconsidered
claim may be allowed or disallowed according to the equities of the case. Reconsideration of a claim
under this subsection does not affect the validity of any payment or transfer from the estate made to a
holder of an allowed claim on account of such allowed claim that is not reconsidered, but if a
reconsidered claim is allowed and is of the same class as such holder's claim, such holder may not
receive any additional payment or transfer from the estate on account of such holder's allowed claim
until the holder of such reconsidered and allowed claim receives payment on account of such claim
proportionate in value to that already received by such other holder. This subsection does not alter or
modify the trustee's right to recover from a creditor any excess payment or transfer made to such

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
The House amendment adopts a compromise position in section 502(a) between H.R. 8200, as passed by
the House, and the Senate amendment. Section 502(a) has been modified to make clear that a party in interest
includes a creditor of a partner in a partnership that is a debtor under chapter 7. Since the trustee of the
partnership is given an absolute claim against the estate of each general partner under section 723(c), creditors
of the partner must have standing to object to claims against the partnership at the partnership level because no
opportunity will be afforded at the partner's level for such objection.
The House amendment contains a provision in section 502(b)(1) that requires disallowance of a claim to the
extent that such claim is unenforceable against the debtor and unenforceable against property of the debtor.
This is intended to result in the disallowance of any claim for deficiency by an undersecured creditor on a
non-recourse loan or under a State antideficiency law, special provision for which is made in section 1111,
since neither the debtor personally, nor the property of the debtor is liable for such a deficiency. Similarly
claims for usurious interest or which could be barred by an agreement between the creditor and the debtor
would be disallowed.
Section 502(b)(7)(A) represents a compromise between the House bill and the Senate amendment. The
House amendment takes the provision in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House of Representatives but increases
the percentage from 10 to 15 percent.
As used in section 502(b)(7), the phrase "lease of real property" applies only to a "true" or "bona fide" lease
and does not apply to financing leases of real property or interests therein, or to leases of such property which
are intended as security.
Historically, the limitation on allowable claims of lessors of real property was based on two considerations.
First, the amount of the lessor's damages on breach of a real estate lease was considered contingent and
difficult to prove. Partly for this reason, claims of a lessor of real estate were not provable prior to the 1934
amendments, to the Bankruptcy Act [former title 11]. Second, in a true lease of real property, the lessor retains
all risks and benefits as to the value of the real estate at the termination of the lease. Historically, it was,
therefore, considered equitable to limit the claims of real estate lessor.
However, these considerations are not present in "lease financing" transactions where, in substance, the
"lease" involves a sale of the real estate and the rental payments are in substance the payment of principal and
interest on a secured loan or sale. In a financing lease the lessor is essentially a secured or unsecured creditor
(depending upon whether his interest is perfected or not) of the debtor, and the lessor's claim should not be
subject to the 502(b)(7) limitation. Financing "leases" are in substance installment sales or loans. The "lessors"
are essentially sellers or lenders and should be treated as such for purposes of the bankruptcy law.
Whether a "lease" is true or bona fide lease or, in the alternative a financing "lease" or a lease intended as
security, depends upon the circumstances of each case. The distinction between a true lease and a financing
transaction is based upon the economic substance of the transaction and not, for example, upon the locus of
title, the form of the transaction or the fact that the transaction is denominated as a "lease." The fact that the
lessee, upon compliance with the terms of the lease, becomes or has the option to become the owner of the
leased property for no additional consideration or for nominal consideration indicates that the transaction is a
financing lease or lease intended as security. In such cases, the lessor has no substantial interest in the leased
property at the expiration of the lease term. In addition, the fact that the lessee assumes and discharges
substantially all the risks and obligations ordinarily attributed to the outright ownership of the property is more
indicative of a financing transaction than of a true lease. The rental payments in such cases are in substance
payments of principal and interest either on a loan secured by the leased real property or on the purchase of
the leased real property. See, e.g., Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 13 and SEC Reg.
S–X, 17 C.F.R. sec. 210.3–16(q) (1977); cf. First National Bank of Chicago v. Irving Trust Co., 74 F.2d 263
(2nd Cir. 1934); and Albenda and Lief, "Net Lease Financing Transactions Under the Proposed Bankruptcy
Act of 1973," 30 Business Lawyer, 713 (1975).
Section 502(c) of the House amendment presents a compromise between similar provisions contained in the
House bill and the Senate amendment. The compromise language is consistent with an amendment to the
definition of "claim" in section 104(4)(B) of the House amendment and requires estimation of any right to an
equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment. To the extent
language in the House and Senate reports indicate otherwise, such language is expressly overruled.
[Release Point 118-106]
Section 502(e) of the House amendment contains language modifying a similar section in the House bill
and Senate amendment. Section 502(e)(1) states the general rule requiring the court to disallow any claim for
reimbursement or contribution of an entity that is liable with the debtor on, or that has secured, the claim of a
creditor to any extent that the creditor's claim against the estate is disallowed. This adopts a policy that a
surety's claim for reimbursement or contribution is entitled to no better status than the claim of the creditor
assured by such surety. Section 502(e)(1)(B) alternatively disallows any claim for reimbursement or
contribution by a surety to the extent such claim is contingent as of the time of allowance. Section 502(e)(2) is
clear that to the extent a claim for reimbursement or contribution becomes fixed after the commencement of
the case that it is to be considered a prepetition claim for purposes of allowance. The combined effect of
sections 502(e)(1)(B) and 502(e)(2) is that a surety or codebtor is generally permitted a claim for
reimbursement or contribution to the extent the surety or codebtor has paid the assured party at the time of
allowance. Section 502(e)(1)(C) alternatively indicates that a claim for reimbursement or contribution of a
surety or codebtor is disallowed to the extent the surety or codebtor requests subrogation under section 509
with respect to the rights of the assured party. Thus, the surety or codebtor has a choice; to the extent a claim
for contribution or reimbursement would be advantageous, such as in the case where such a claim is secured, a
surety or codebtor may opt for reimbursement or contribution under section 502(e). On the other hand, to the
extent the claim for such surety or codebtor by way of subrogation is more advantageous, such as where such
claim is secured, the surety may elect subrogation under section 509.
The section changes current law by making the election identical in all other respects. To the extent a
creditor's claim is satisfied by a surety or codebtor, other creditors should not benefit by the surety's inability
to file a claim against the estate merely because such surety or codebtor has failed to pay such creditor's claim
in full. On the other hand, to the extent the creditor's claim against the estate is otherwise disallowed, the
surety or codebtor should not be entitled to increased rights by way of reimbursement or contribution, to the
detriment of competing claims of other unsecured creditors, than would be realized by way of subrogation.
While the foregoing scheme is equitable with respect to other unsecured creditors of the debtor, it is
desirable to preserve present law to the extent that a surety or codebtor is not permitted to compete with the
creditor he has assured until the assured party's claim has paid in full. Accordingly, section 509(c) of the
House amendment subordinates both a claim by way of subrogation or a claim for reimbursement or
contribution of a surety or codebtor to the claim of the assured party until the assured party's claim is paid in
full.
Section 502(h) of the House amendment expands similar provisions contained in the House bill and the
Senate amendment to indicate that any claim arising from the recovery of property under section 522(i), 550,
or 553 shall be determined as though it were a prepetition claim.
Section 502(i) of the House amendment adopts a provision contained in section 502(j) of H.R. 8200 as
passed by the House but that was not contained in the Senate amendment.
Section 502(i) of H.R. 8200 as passed by the House, but was not included in the Senate amendment, is
deleted as a matter to be left to the bankruptcy tax bill next year.
The House amendment deletes section 502(i) of the Senate bill but adopts the policy of that section to a
limited extent for confirmation of a plan of reorganization in section 1111(b) of the House amendment.
Section 502(j) of the House amendment is new. The provision codifies section 57k of the Bankruptcy Act
[section 93(k) of former title 11].
Allowance of Claims or Interest: The House amendment adopts section 502(b)(9) of the House bill which
disallows any tax claim resulting from a reduction of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) credit (sec.
3302 of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 3302]) on account of a tardy contribution to a State
unemployment fund if the contribution is attributable to ways or other compensation paid by the debtor before
bankruptcy. The Senate amendment allowed this reduction, but would have subordinated it to other claims in
the distribution of the estate's assets by treating it as a punitive (nonpecuniary loss) penalty. The House
amendment would also not bar reduction of the FUTA credit on account of a trustee's late payment of a
contribution to a State unemployment fund if the contribution was attributable to a trustee's payment of
compensation earned from the estate.
Section 511 of the Senate amendment is deleted. Its substance is adopted in section 502(b)(9) of the House
amendment which reflects an identical provision contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
A proof of claim or interest is prima facie evidence of the claim or interest. Thus, it is allowed under
subsection (a) unless a party in interest objects. The rules and case law will determine who is a party in
interest for purposes of objection to allowance. The case law is well developed on this subject today. As a
result of the change in the liability of a general partner's estate for the debts of this partnership, see proposed
[Release Point 118-106]
11 U.S.C. 723, the category of persons that are parties in interest in the partnership case will be expanded to
include a creditor of a partner against whose estate the trustee of the partnership estate may proceed under
proposed 11 U.S.C. 723(c).
Subsection (b) prescribes the grounds on which a claim may be disallowed. The court will apply these
standards if there is an objection to a proof of claim. The burden of proof on the issue of allowance is left to
the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. Under the current chapter XIII rules, a creditor is required to prove that
his claim is free from usury, rule 13–301. It is expected that the rules will make similar provision for both
liquidation and individual repayment plan cases. See Bankruptcy Act §656(b) [section 1056(b) of former title
11]; H.R. 31, 94th Cong., 1st sess., sec. 6–104(a) (1975).
Paragraph (1) requires disallowance if the claim is unenforceable against the debtor for any reason (such as
usury, unconscionability, or failure of consideration) other than because it is contingent or unmatured. All
such contingent or unmatured claims are to be liquidated by the bankruptcy court in order to afford the debtor
complete bankruptcy relief; these claims are generally not provable under present law.
Paragraph (2) requires disallowance to the extent that the claim is for unmatured interest as of the date of
the petition. Whether interest is matured or unmatured on the date of bankruptcy is to be determined without
reference to any ipso facto or bankruptcy clause in the agreement creating the claim. Interest disallowed under
this paragraph includes postpetition interest that is not yet due and payable, and any portion of prepaid interest
that represents an original discounting of the claim, yet that would not have been earned on the date of
bankruptcy. For example, a claim on a $1,000 note issued the day before bankruptcy would only be allowed to
the extent of the cash actually advanced. If the original discount was 10 percent so that the cash advanced was
only $900, then notwithstanding the face amount of note, only $900 would be allowed. If $900 was advanced
under the note some time before bankruptcy, the interest component of the note would have to be prorated and
disallowed to the extent it was for interest after the commencement of the case.
Section 502(b) thus contains two principles of present law. First, interest stops accruing at the date of the
filing of the petition, because any claim for unmatured interest is disallowed under this paragraph. Second,
bankruptcy operates as the acceleration of the principal amount of all claims against the debtor. One
unarticulated reason for this is that the discounting factor for claims after the commencement of the case is
equivalent to contractual interest rate on the claim. Thus, this paragraph does not cause disallowance of claims
that have not been discounted to a present value because of the irrebuttable presumption that the discounting
rate and the contractual interest rate (even a zero interest rate) are equivalent.
Paragraph (3) requires disallowance of a claim to the extent that the creditor may offset the claim against a
debt owing to the debtor. This will prevent double recovery, and permit the claim to be filed only for the
balance due. This follows section 68 of the Bankruptcy Act [section 108 of former title 11].
Paragraph (4) requires disallowance of a property tax claim to the extent that the tax due exceeds the value
of the property. This too follows current law to the extent the property tax is ad valorem.
Paragraph (5) prevents overreaching by the debtor's attorneys and concealing of assets by debtors. It permits
the court to examine the claim of a debtor's attorney independently of any other provision of this subsection,
and to disallow it to the extent that it exceeds the reasonable value of the attorneys' services.
Postpetition alimony, maintenance or support claims are disallowed under paragraph (6). They are to be
paid from the debtor's postpetition property, because the claims are nondischargeable.
Paragraph (7), derived from current law, limits the damages allowable to a landlord of the debtor. The
history of this provision is set out at length in Oldden v. Tonto Realty Co., 143 F.2d 916 (2d Cir. 1944). It is
designed to compensate the landlord for his loss while not permitting a claim so large (based on a long-term
lease) as to prevent other general unsecured creditors from recovering a dividend from the estate. The
damages a landlord may assert from termination of a lease are limited to the rent reserved for the greater of
one year or ten percent of the remaining lease term, not to exceed three years, after the earlier of the date of
the filing of the petition and the date of surrender or repossession in a chapter 7 case and 3 years lease
payments in a chapter 9, 11, or 13 case. The sliding scale formula for chapter 7 cases is new and designed to
protect the long-term lessor. This subsection does not apply to limit administrative expense claims for use of
the leased premises to which the landlord is otherwise entitled.
This paragraph will not overrule Oldden, or the proposition for which it has been read to stand: To the
extent that a landlord has a security deposit in excess of the amount of his claim allowed under this paragraph,
the excess comes into the estate. Moreover, his allowed claim is for his total damages, as limited by this
paragraph. By virtue of proposed 11 U.S.C. 506(a) and 506(d), the claim will be divided into a secured portion
and an unsecured portion in those cases in which the deposit that the landlord holds is less than his damages.
As under Oldden, he will not be permitted to offset his actual damages against his security deposit and then
claim for the balance under this paragraph. Rather, his security deposit will be applied in satisfaction of the
claim that is allowed under this paragraph.
[Release Point 118-106]
As used in section 502(b)(7), the phrase "lease of real property" applies only to a "true" or "bona fide" lease
and does not apply to financing leases of real property or interests therein, or to leases of such property which
are intended as security.
Historically, the limitation on allowable claims of lessors of real property was based on two considerations.
First, the amount of the lessors damages on breach of a real estate lease was considered contingent and
difficult to prove. Partly for this reason, claims of a lessor of real estate were not provable prior to the 1934
amendments to the Bankruptcy Act [former title 11]. Second, in a true lease of real property, the lessor retains
all risk and benefits as to the value of the real estate at the termination of the lease. Historically, it was,
therefore, considered equitable to limit the claims of a real estate lessor.
However, these considerations are not present in "lease financing" transactions where, in substance, the
"lease" involves a sale of the real estate and the rental payments are in substance the payment of principal and
interest on a secured loan or sale. In a financing lease the lessor is essentially a secured or unsecured creditor
(depending upon whether his interest is perfected or not) of the debtor, and the lessor's claim should not be
subject to the 502(b)(7) limitation. Financing "leases" are in substance installment sales or loans. The "lessors"
are essentially sellers or lenders and should be treated as such for purposes of the bankruptcy law.
Whether a "lease" is true or bona fide lease or, in the alternative, a financing "lease" or a lease intended as
security, depends upon the circumstances of each case. The distinction between a true lease and a financing
transaction is based upon the economic substance of the transaction and not, for example, upon the locus of

lessee, upon compliance with the terms of the lease, becomes or has the option to become the owner of the
leased property for no additional consideration or for nominal consideration indicates that the transaction is a
financing lease or lease intended as security. In such cases, the lessor has no substantial interest in the leased
property at the expiration of the lease term. In addition, the fact that the lessee assumes and discharges
substantially all the risks and obligations ordinarily attributed to the outright ownership of the property is more
indicative of a financing transaction than of a true lease. The rental payments in such cases are in substance
payments of principal and interest either on a loan secured by the leased real property or on the purchase of
the leased real property. See, e. g., Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 13 and SEC Reg.
S–X, 17 C.F.R. sec. 210.3–16(q) (1977); cf. First National Bank of Chicago v. Irving Trust Co., 74 F.2d 263
(2nd Cir. 1934); and Albenda and Lief, "Net Lease Financing Transactions Under the Proposed Bankruptcy
Act of 1973," 30 Business Lawyer, 713 (1975).
Paragraph (8) is new. It tracks the landlord limitation on damages provision in paragraph (7) for damages
resulting from the breach by the debtor of an employment contract, but limits the recovery to the
compensation reserved under an employment contract for the year following the earlier of the date of the
petition and the termination of employment.
Subsection (c) requires the estimation of any claim liquidation of which would unduly delay the closing of
the estate, such as a contingent claim, or any claim for which applicable law provides only an equitable
remedy, such as specific performance. This subsection requires that all claims against the debtor be converted
into dollar amounts.
Subsection (d) is derived from present law. It requires disallowance of a claim of a transferee of a voidable
transfer in toto if the transferee has not paid the amount or turned over the property received as required under
the sections under which the transferee's liability arises.
Subsection (e) also derived from present law, requires disallowance of the claim for reimbursement or
contribution of a codebtor, surety or guarantor of an obligation of the debtor, unless the claim of the creditor
on such obligation has been paid in full. The provision prevents competition between a creditor and his
guarantor for the limited proceeds in the estate.
Subsection (f) specifies that "involuntary gap" creditors receive the same treatment as prepetition creditors.
Under the allowance provisions of this subsection, knowledge of the commencement of the case will be
irrelevant. The claim is to be allowed "the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the
petition." Under voluntary petition, proposed 11 U.S.C. 303(f), creditors must be permitted to deal with the
debtor and be assured that their claims will be paid. For purposes of this subsection, "creditors" include
governmental units holding claims for tax liabilities incurred during the period after the petition is filed and
before the earlier of the order for relief or appointment of a trustee.
Subsection (g) gives entities injured by the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease, either
under section 365 or under a plan or reorganization, a prepetition claim for any resulting damages, and
requires that the injured entity be treated as a prepetition creditor with respect to that claim.
Subsection (h) gives a transferee of a setoff that is recovered by one trustee a prepetition claim for the
amount recovered.
Subsection (i) answers the nonrecourse loan problem and gives the creditor an unsecured claim for the
[Release Point 118-106]
difference between the value of the collateral and the debt in response to the decision in Great National Life
Ins. Co. v. Pine Gate Associates, Ltd., Bankruptcy Case No. B75–4345A (N.D.Ga. Sept. 16, 1977).
The bill, as reported, deletes a provision in the bill as originally introduced (former sec. 502(i)) requiring a
tax authority to file a proof of claim for recapture of an investment credit where, during title 11 proceedings,
the trustee sells or otherwise disposes of property before the title 11 case began. The tax authority should not
be required to submit a formal claim for a taxable event (a sale or other disposition of the asset) of whose
occurrence the trustee necessarily knows better than the taxing authority. For procedural purposes, the
recapture of investment credit is to be treated as an administrative expense, as to which only a request for
payment is required.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Paragraph (9) [of subsec. (b)] requires disallowance of certain employment tax claims. These relate to a
Federal tax credit for State unemployment insurance taxes which is disallowed if the State tax is paid late.
This paragraph disallows the Federal claim for the tax the same as if the credit had been allowed in full on the
Federal return.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 503(a) of the House amendment represents a compromise between similar provisions in the House
[Release Point 118-106]
bill and the Senate amendment by leaving to the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure the determination of the
location at which a request for payment of an administrative expense may be filed. The preamble to section
503(b) of the House bill makes a similar change with respect to the allowance of administrative expenses.
Section 503(b)(1) adopts the approach taken in the House bill as modified by some provisions contained in
the Senate amendment. The preamble to section 503(b) makes clear that none of the paragraphs of section
503(b) apply to claims or expenses of the kind specified in section 502(f) that arise in the ordinary course of
the debtor's business or financial affairs and that arise during the gap between the commencement of an
involuntary case and the appointment of a trustee or the order for relief, whichever first occurs. The remainder
of section 503(b) represents a compromise between H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate
amendments. Section 503(b)(3)(E) codifies present law in cases such as Randolph v. Scruggs, 190 U.S. 533,
which accords administrative expense status to services rendered by a prepetition custodian or other party to
the extent such services actually benefit the estate. Section 503(b)(4) of the House amendment conforms to the
provision contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and deletes language contained in the Senate
amendment providing a different standard of compensation under section 330 of that amendment.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) of this section permits administrative expense claimants to file with the court a request for
payment of an administrative expense. The Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure will specify the time, the form,
and the method of such a filing.
Subsection (b) specifies the kinds of administrative expenses that are allowable in a case under the
bankruptcy code. The subsection is derived mainly from section 64a(1) of the Bankruptcy Act [section
104(a)(1) of former title 11], with some changes. The actual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the
estate, including wages, salaries, or commissions for services rendered after the order for relief, and any taxes
on, measured by, or withheld from such wages, salaries, or commissions, are allowable as administrative
expenses.
In general, administrative expenses include taxes which the trustee incurs in administering the debtor's
estate, including taxes on capital gains from sales of property by the trustee and taxes on income earned by the
estate during the case. Interest on tax liabilities and certain tax penalties incurred by the trustee are also
included in this first priority.
Taxes which the Internal Revenue Service may find due after giving the trustee a so-called "quickie" tax
refund and later doing an audit of the refund are also payable as administrative expenses. The tax code [title
26] permits the trustee of an estate which suffers a net operating loss to carry back the loss against an earlier
profit year of the estate or of the debtor and to obtain a tentative refund for the earlier year, subject, however,
to a later full audit of the loss which led to the refund. The bill, in effect, requires the Internal Revenue Service
to issue a tentative refund to the trustee (whether the refund was applied for by the debtor or by the trustee),
but if the refund later proves to have been erroneous in amount, the Service can request that the tax
attributable to the erroneous refund be payable by the estate as an administrative expense.
Postpetition payments to an individual debtor for services rendered to the estate are administrative
expenses, and are not property of the estate when received by the debtor. This situation would most likely
arise when the individual was a sole proprietor and was employed by the estate to run the business after the
commencement of the case. An individual debtor in possession would be so employed, for example. See Local
Loan v. Hunt, 292 U.S. 234, 243 (1943).
Compensation and reimbursement awarded officers of the estate under section 330 are allowable as
administrative expenses. Actual, necessary expenses, other than compensation of a professional person,
incurred by a creditor that files an involuntary petition, by a creditor that recovers property for the benefit of
the estate, by a creditor that acts in connection with the prosecution of a criminal offense relating to the case,
by a creditor, indenture, trustee, equity security holder, or committee of creditors or equity security holders
(other than official committees) that makes a substantial contribution to a reorganization or municipal debt
adjustment case, or by a superseded custodian, are all allowable administrative expenses. The phrase
"substantial contribution in the case" is derived from Bankruptcy Act §§242 and 243 [sections 642 and 643 of
former title 11]. It does not require a contribution that leads to confirmation of a plan, for in many cases, it
will be a substantial contribution if the person involved uncovers facts that would lead to a denial of
confirmation, such as fraud in connection with the case.
Paragraph (4) permits reasonable compensation for professional services rendered by an attorney or an
accountant of an equity whose expense is compensable under the previous paragraph. Paragraph (5) permits
reasonable compensation for an indenture trustee in making a substantial contribution in a reorganization or
municipal debt adjustment case. Finally, paragraph (6) permits witness fees and mileage as prescribed under
chapter 119 [§2041 et seq.] of title 28.

judicial or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction.
(2) The court may not so determine—
(A) the amount or legality of a tax, fine, penalty, or addition to tax if such amount or legality
was contested before and adjudicated by a judicial or administrative tribunal of competent
jurisdiction before the commencement of the case under this title;
(B) any right of the estate to a tax refund, before the earlier of—
(i) 120 days after the trustee properly requests such refund from the governmental unit from

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 505 of the House amendment adopts a compromise position with respect to the determination of tax
liability from the position taken in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and in the Senate amendment.
[Release Point 118-106]
Determinations of tax liability: Authority of bankruptcy court to rule on merits of tax claims.—The House
amendment authorizes the bankruptcy court to rule on the merits of any tax claim involving an unpaid tax,
fine, or penalty relating to a tax, or any addition to a tax, of the debtor or the estate. This authority applies, in
general, whether or not the tax, penalty, fine, or addition to tax had been previously assessed or paid.
However, the bankruptcy court will not have jurisdiction to rule on the merits of any tax claim which has been
previously adjudicated, in a contested proceeding, before a court of competent jurisdiction. For this purpose, a
proceeding in the U.S. Tax Court is to be considered "contested" if the debtor filed a petition in the Tax Court
by the commencement of the case and the Internal Revenue Service had filed an answer to the petition.
Therefore, if a petition and answer were filed in the Tax Court before the title II petition was filed, and if the
debtor later defaults in the Tax Court, then, under res judicata principles, the bankruptcy court could not then
rule on the debtor's or the estate's liability for the same taxes.
The House amendment adopts the rule of the Senate bill that the bankruptcy court can, under certain
conditions, determine the amount of tax refund claim by the trustee. Under the House amendment, if the
refund results from an offset or counterclaim to a claim or request for payment by the Internal Revenue
Service, or other tax authority, the trustee would not first have to file an administrative claim for refund with
the tax authority.
However, if the trustee requests a refund in other situations, he would first have to submit an administrative
claim for the refund. Under the House amendment, if the Internal Revenue Service, or other tax authority does
not rule on the refund claim within 120 days, then the bankruptcy court may rule on the merits of the refund
claim.
Under the Internal Revenue Code [title 26], a suit for refund of Federal taxes cannot be filed until 6 months
after a claim for refund is filed with the Internal Revenue Service (sec. 6532(a) [title 26]). Because of the
bankruptcy aim to close the estate as expeditiously as possible, the House amendment shortens to 120 days the
period for the Internal Revenue Service to decide the refund claim.
The House amendment also adopts the substance of the Senate bill rule permitting the bankruptcy court to
determine the amount of any penalty, whether punitive or pecuniary in nature, relating to taxes over which it
has jurisdiction.
Jurisdiction of the tax court in bankruptcy cases: The Senate amendment provided a detailed series of rules
concerning the jurisdiction of the U.S. Tax Court, or similar State or local administrative tribunal to determine
personal tax liabilities of an individual debtor. The House amendment deletes these specific rules and relies on
procedures to be derived from broad general powers of the bankruptcy court.
Under the House amendment, as under present law, a corporation seeking reorganization under chapter 11
is considered to be personally before the bankruptcy court for purposes of giving that court jurisdiction over
the debtor's personal liability for a nondischargeable tax.
The rules are more complex where the debtor is an individual under chapter 7, 11, or 13. An individual
debtor or the tax authority can, as under section 17c of the present Bankruptcy Act [section 35(c) of former
title 11], file a request that the bankruptcy court determine the debtor's personal liability for the balance of any
nondischargeable tax not satisfied from assets of the estate. The House amendment intends to retain these
procedures and also adds a rule staying commencement or continuation of any proceeding in the Tax Court
after the bankruptcy petition is filed, unless and until that stay is lifted by the bankruptcy judge under section
362(a)(8). The House amendment also stays assessment as well as collection of a prepetition claim against the
debtor (sec. 362(a)(6)). A tax authority would not, however, be stayed from issuing a deficiency notice during
the bankruptcy case (sec. (b)(7)) [sec. 362(b)(8)]. The Senate amendment repealed the existing authority of the
Internal Revenue Service to make an immediate assessment of taxes upon bankruptcy (sec. 6871(a) of the
code [title 26]. See section 321 of the Senate bill. As indicated, the substance of that provision, also affecting
State and local taxes, is contained in section 362(a)(6) of the House amendment. The statute of limitations is
tolled under the House amendment while the bankruptcy case is pending.
Where no proceeding in the Tax Court is pending at the commencement of the bankruptcy case, the tax
authority can, under the House amendment, file a claim against the estate for a prepetition tax liability and
may also file a request that the bankruptcy court hear arguments and decide the merits of an individual
debtor's personal liability for the balance of any nondischargeable tax liability not satisfied from assets of the
estate. Bankruptcy terminology refers to the latter type of request as a creditor's complaint to determine the
dischargeability of a debt. Where such a complaint is filed, the bankruptcy court will have personal
jurisdiction over an individual debtor, and the debtor himself would have no access to the Tax Court, or to any
other court, to determine his personal liability for nondischargeable taxes.
If a tax authority decides not to file a claim for taxes which would typically occur where there are few, if
any, assets in the estate, normally the tax authority would also not request the bankruptcy court to rule on the
debtor's personal liability for a nondischargeable tax. Under the House amendment, the tax authority would
[Release Point 118-106]
then have to follow normal procedures in order to collect a nondischargeable tax. For example, in the case of
nondischargeable Federal income taxes, the Internal Revenue Service would be required to issue a deficiency
notice to an individual debtor, and the debtor could then file a petition in the Tax Court—or a refund suit in a
district court—as the forum in which to litigate his personal liability for a nondischargeable tax.
Under the House amendment, as under present law, an individual debtor can also file a complaint to
determine dischargeability. Consequently, where the tax authority does not file a claim or a request that the
bankruptcy court determine dischargeability of a specific tax liability, the debtor could file such a request on
his own behalf, so that the bankruptcy court would then determine both the validity of the claim against assets
in the estate and also the personal liability of the debtor for any nondischargeable tax.
Where a proceeding is pending in the Tax Court at the commencement of the bankruptcy case, the
commencement of the bankruptcy case automatically stays further action in the Tax Court case unless and
until the stay is lifted by the bankruptcy court. The Senate amendment repealed a provision of the Internal
Revenue case barring a debtor from filing a petition in the Tax Court after commencement of a bankruptcy
case (sec. 6871(b) of the code [26 U.S.C. 6871(b)]). See section 321 of the Senate bill. As indicated earlier,
the equivalent of the code amendment is embodied in section 362(a)(8) of the House amendment, which
automatically stays commencement or continuation of any proceeding in the Tax Court until the stay is lifted
or the case is terminated. The stay will permit sufficient time for the bankruptcy trustee to determine if he
desires to join the Tax Court proceeding on behalf of the estate. Where the trustee chooses to join the Tax
Court proceeding, it is expected that he will seek permission to intervene in the Tax Court case and then
request that the stay on the Tax Court proceeding be lifted. In such a case, the merits of the tax liability will be
determined by the Tax Court, and its decision will bind both the individual debtor as to any taxes which are
nondischargeable and the trustee as to the tax claim against the estate.
Where the trustee does not want to intervene in the Tax Court, but an individual debtor wants to have the
Tax Court determine the amount of his personal liability for nondischargeable taxes, the debtor can request the
bankruptcy court to lift the automatic stay on existing Tax Court proceedings. If the stay is lifted and the Tax
Court reaches its decision before the bankruptcy court's decision on the tax claim against the estate, the
decision of the Tax Court would bind the bankruptcy court under principles of res judicata because the
decision of the Tax Court affected the personal liability of the debtor. If the trustee does not wish to subject
the estate to the decision of the Tax Court if the latter court decides the issues before the bankruptcy court
rules, the trustee could resist the lifting of the stay on the existing Tax Court proceeding. If the Internal
Revenue Service had issued a deficiency notice to the debtor before the bankruptcy case began, but as of the
filing of the bankruptcy petition the 90-day period for filing in the Tax Court was still running, the debtor
would be automatically stayed from filing a petition in the Tax Court. If either the debtor or the Internal
Revenue Service then files a complaint to determine dischargeability in the bankruptcy court, the decision of
the bankruptcy court would bind both the debtor and the Internal Revenue Service.
The bankruptcy judge could, however, lift the stay on the debtor to allow him to petition the Tax Court,
while reserving the right to rule on the tax authority's claim against assets of the estate. The bankruptcy court
could also, upon request by the trustee, authorize the trustee to intervene in the Tax Court for purposes of
having the estate also governed by the decision of the Tax Court.
In essence, under the House amendment, the bankruptcy judge will have authority to determine which court
will determine the merits of the tax claim both as to claims against the estate and claims against the debtor
concerning his personal liability for nondischargeable taxes. Thus, if the Internal Revenue Service, or a State
or local tax authority, files a petition to determine dischargeability, the bankruptcy judge can either rule on the
merits of the claim and continue the stay on any pending Tax Court proceeding or lift the stay on the Tax
Court and hold the dischargeability complaint in abeyance. If he rules on the merits of the complaint before
the decision of the Tax Court is reached, the bankruptcy court's decision would bind the debtor as to
nondischargeable taxes and the Tax Court would be governed by that decision under principles of res judicata.
If the bankruptcy judge does not rule on the merits of the complaint before the decision of the Tax Court is
reached, the bankruptcy court will be bound by the decision of the Tax Court as it affects the amount of any
claim against the debtor's estate.
If the Internal Revenue Service does not file a complaint to determine dischargeability and the automatic
stay on a pending Tax Court proceeding is not lifted, the bankruptcy court could determine the merits of any
tax claim against the estate. That decision will not bind the debtor personally because he would not have been
personally before the bankruptcy court unless the debtor himself asks the bankruptcy court to rule on his
personal liability. In any such situation where no party filed a dischargeability petition, the debtor would have
access to the Tax Court to determine his personal liability for a nondischargeable tax debt. While the Tax
Court in such a situation could take into account the ruling of the bankruptcy court on claims against the estate
in deciding the debtor's personal liability, the bankruptcy court's ruling would not bind the Tax Court under
[Release Point 118-106]
principles of res judicata, because the debtor, in that situation, would not have been personally before the
bankruptcy court.
If neither the debtor nor the Internal Revenue Service files a claim against the estate or a request to rule on
the debtor's personal liability, any pending tax court proceeding would be stayed until the closing of the
bankruptcy case, at which time the stay on the tax court would cease and the tax court case could continue for
purposes of deciding the merits of the debtor's personal liability for nondischargeable taxes.
Audit of trustee's returns: Under both bills, the bankruptcy court could determine the amount of any
administrative period taxes. The Senate amendment, however, provided for an expedited audit procedure,
which was mandatory in some cases. The House amendment (sec. 505(b)), adopts the provision of the House
bill allowing the trustee discretion in all cases whether to ask the Internal Revenue Service, or State or local
tax authority for a prompt audit of his returns on behalf of the estate. The House amendment, however, adopts
the provision of the Senate bill permitting a prompt audit only on the basis of tax returns filed by the trustee
for completed taxable periods. Procedures for a prompt audit set forth in the Senate bill are also adopted in
modified form.
Under the procedure, before the case can be closed, the trustee may request a tax audit by the local, State or
Federal tax authority of all tax returns filed by the trustee. The taxing authority would have to notify the
trustee and the bankruptcy court within 60 days whether it accepts returns or desires to audit the returns more
fully. If an audit is conducted, the taxing authority would have to notify the trustee of tax deficiency within
180 days after the original request, subject to extensions of time if the bankruptcy court approves. If the
trustee does not agree with the results of the audit, the trustee could ask the bankruptcy court to resolve the
dispute. Once the trustee's tax liability for administration period taxes has thus been determined, the legal
effect in a case under chapter 7 or 11 would be to discharge the trustee and any predecessor of the trustee, and
also the debtor, from any further liability for these taxes.
The prompt audit procedure would not be available with respect to any tax liability as to which any return
required to be filed on behalf of the estate is not filed with the proper tax authority. The House amendment
also specifies that a discharge of the trustee or the debtor which would otherwise occur will not be granted, or
will be void if the return filed on behalf of the estate reflects fraud or material misrepresentation of facts.
For purposes of the above prompt audit procedures, it is intended that the tax authority with which the
request for audit is to be filed is, as the Federal taxes, the office of the District Director in the district where
the bankruptcy case is pending.
Under the House amendment, if the trustee does not request a prompt audit, the debtor would not be
discharged from possible transferee liability if any assets are returned to the debtor.
Assessment after decision: As indicated above, the commencement of a bankruptcy case automatically stays
assessment of any tax (sec. 362(a)(6)). However, the House amendment provides (sec. 505(c)) that if the
bankruptcy court renders a final judgment with regard to any tax (under the rules discussed above), the tax
authority may then make an assessment (if permitted to do so under otherwise applicable tax law) without
waiting for termination of the case or confirmation of a reorganization plan.
Trustee's authority to appeal tax cases: The equivalent provision in the House bill (sec. 505(b)) and in the
Senate bill (sec. 362(h)) authorizing the trustee to prosecute an appeal or review of a tax case are deleted as
unnecessary. Section 541(a) of the House amendment provides that property of the estate is to include all legal
or equitable interests of the debtor. These interests include the debtor's causes of action, so that the specific
provisions of the House and Senate bills are not needed.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsections (a) and (b) are derived, with only stylistic changes, from section 2a(2A) of the Bankruptcy Act
[section 11(a)(2A) of former title 11]. They permit determination by the bankruptcy court of any unpaid tax
liability of the debtor that has not been contested before or adjudicated by a judicial or administrative tribunal
of competent jurisdiction before the bankruptcy case, and the prosecution by the trustee of an appeal from an
order of such a body if the time for review or appeal has not expired before the commencement of the
bankruptcy case. As under current Bankruptcy Act §2a (2A), Arkansas Corporation Commissioner v.
Thompson, 313 U.S. 132 (1941), remains good law to permit abstention where uniformity of assessment is of
significant importance.
Section (c) deals with procedures for obtaining a prompt audit of tax returns filed by the trustee in a
liquidation or reorganization case. Under the bill as originally introduced, a trustee who is "in doubt"
concerning tax liabilities of the estate incurred during a title 11 proceeding could obtain a discharge from
personal liability for himself and the debtor (but not for the debtor or the debtor's successor in a
reorganization), provided that certain administrative procedures were followed. The trustee could request a
prompt tax audit by the local, State, or Federal governmental unit. The taxing authority would have to notify
[Release Point 118-106]
the trustee and the court within sixty days whether it accepted the return or desired to audit the returns more
fully. If an audit were conducted, the tax office would have to notify the trustee of any tax deficiency within 4
months (subject to an extension of time if the court approved). These procedures would apply only to tax
years completed on or before the case was closed and for which the trustee had filed a tax return.
The committee bill eliminates the "in doubt" rule and makes mandatory (rather than optional) the trustee's
request for a prompt audit of the estate's tax returns. In many cases, the trustee could not be certain that his
returns raised no doubt about possible tax issues. In addition, it is desirable not to create a situation where the
taxing authority asserts a tax liability against the debtor (as transferee of surplus assets, if any, return to him)
after the case is over; in any such situation, the debtor would be called on to defend a tax return which he did
not prepare. Under the amendment, all disputes concerning these returns are to be resolved by the bankruptcy
court, and both the trustee and the debtor himself do not then face potential post-bankruptcy tax liabilities
based on these returns. This result would occur as to the debtor, however, only in a liquidation case.
In a reorganization in which the debtor or a successor to the debtor continues in existence, the trustee could
obtain a discharge from personal liability through the prompt audit procedure, but the Treasury could still
claim a deficiency against the debtor (or his successor) for additional taxes due on returns filed during the title
11 proceedings.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (c) is new. It codifies in part the referee's decision in In re Statmaster Corp., 465 F.2d 987 (5th
Cir. 1972). Its purpose is to protect the trustee from personal liability for a tax falling on the estate that is not
assessed until after the case is closed. If necessary to permit expeditious closing of the case, the court, on
request of the trustee, must order the governmental unit charged with the responsibility for collection or
determination of the tax to audit the trustee's return or be barred from attempting later collection. The court
will be required to permit sufficient time to perform an audit, if the taxing authority requests it. The final order
of the court and the payment of the tax determined in that order discharges the trustee, the debtor, and any
successor to the debtor from any further liability for the tax. See Plumb, The Tax Recommendations of the
Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws: Tax Procedures, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 1360, 1423–42 (1975).

§506. Determination of secured status
[Release Point 118-106]
(a)(1) An allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property in which the estate has an
interest, or that is subject to setoff under section 553 of this title, is a secured claim to the extent of
the value of such creditor's interest in the estate's interest in such property, or to the extent of the
amount subject to setoff, as the case may be, and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of
such creditor's interest or the amount so subject to setoff is less than the amount of such allowed
claim. Such value shall be determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed
disposition or use of such property, and in conjunction with any hearing on such disposition or use or
on a plan affecting such creditor's interest.
(2) If the debtor is an individual in a case under chapter 7 or 13, such value with respect to
personal property securing an allowed claim shall be determined based on the replacement value of
such property as of the date of the filing of the petition without deduction for costs of sale or
marketing. With respect to property acquired for personal, family, or household purposes,
replacement value shall mean the price a retail merchant would charge for property of that kind
considering the age and condition of the property at the time value is determined.
(b) To the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which, after
any recovery under subsection (c) of this section, is greater than the amount of such claim, there shall
be allowed to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or
charges provided for under the agreement or State statute under which such claim arose.
(c) The trustee may recover from property securing an allowed secured claim the reasonable,
necessary costs and expenses of preserving, or disposing of, such property to the extent of any
benefit to the holder of such claim, including the payment of all ad valorem property taxes with
respect to the property.
(d) To the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim,
such lien is void, unless—
(1) such claim was disallowed only under section 502(b)(5) or 502(e) of this title; or
(2) such claim is not an allowed secured claim due only to the failure of any entity to file a
proof of such claim under section 501 of this title.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 506(a) of the House amendment adopts the provision contained in the Senate amendment and
rejects a contrary provision as contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House. The provision contained in the
Senate amendment and adopted by the House amendment recognizes that an amount subject to set-off is
sufficient to recognize a secured status in the holder of such right. Additionally a determination of what
portion of an allowed claim is secured and what portion is unsecured is binding only for the purpose for which
the determination is made. Thus determinations for purposes of adequate protection is not binding for
purposes of "cram down" on confirmation in a case under chapter 11.
Section 506(b) of the House amendment adopts language contained in the Senate amendment and rejects
language contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House. If the security agreement between the parties
provides for attorneys' fees, it will be enforceable under title 11, notwithstanding contrary law, and is
recoverable from the collateral after any recovery under section 506(c).
Section 506(c) of the House amendment was contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and adopted,
verbatim, in the Senate amendment. Any time the trustee or debtor in possession expends money to provide
for the reasonable and necessary cost and expenses of preserving or disposing of a secured creditor's
collateral, the trustee or debtor in possession is entitled to recover such expenses from the secured party or
from the property securing an allowed secured claim held by such party.
Section 506(d) of the House amendment is derived from H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and is adopted
in lieu of the alternative test provided in section 506(d) of the Senate amendment. For purposes of section
506(d) of the House amendment, the debtor is a party in interest.
Determination of Secured Status: The House amendment deletes section 506(d)(3) of the Senate
amendment, which insures that a tax lien securing a nondischargeable tax claim is not voided because a tax
authority with notice or knowledge of the bankruptcy case fails to file a claim for the liability (as it may elect
not to do, if it is clear there are insufficient assets to pay the liability). Since the House amendment retains
[Release Point 118-106]
section 506(d) of the House bill that a lien is not voided unless a party in interest has requested that the court
determine and allow or disallow the claim, provision of the Senate amendment is not necessary.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) of this section separates an undersecured creditor's claim into two parts: He has a secured
claim to the extent of the value of his collateral; and he has an unsecured claim for the balance of his claim.
The subsection also provides for the valuation of claims which involve setoffs under section 553. While courts
will have to determine value on a case-by-case basis, the subsection makes it clear that valuation is to be
determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and the proposed disposition or use of the subject property.
This determination shall be made in conjunction with any hearing on such disposition or use of property or on
a plan affecting the creditor's interest. To illustrate, a valuation early in the case in a proceeding under sections
361–363 would not be binding upon the debtor or creditor at the time of confirmation of the plan. Throughout
the bill, references to secured claims are only to the claim determined to be secured under this subsection, and
not to the full amount of the creditor's claim. This provision abolishes the use of the terms "secured creditor"
and "unsecured creditor" and substitutes in their places the terms "secured claim" and "unsecured claim."
Subsection (b) codifies current law by entitling a creditor with an oversecured claim to any reasonable fees
(including attorney's fees), costs, or charges provided under the agreement under which the claim arose. These
fees, costs, and charges are secured claims to the extent that the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of
the underlying claim.
Subsection (c) also codifies current law by permitting the trustee to recover from property the value of
which is greater than the sum of the claims secured by a lien on that property the reasonable, necessary costs
and expenses of preserving, or disposing of, the property. The recovery is limited to the extent of any benefit
to the holder of such claim.
Subsection (d) provides that to the extent a secured claim is not allowed, its lien is void unless the holder
had neither actual notice nor knowledge of the case, the lien was not listed by the debtor in a chapter 9 or 11
case or such claim was disallowed only under section 502(e).
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (d) permits liens to pass through the bankruptcy case unaffected. However, if a party in interest
requests the court to determine and allow or disallow the claim secured by the lien under section 502 and the
claim is not allowed, then the lien is void to the extent that the claim is not allowed. The voiding provision
does not apply to claims disallowed only under section 502(e), which requires disallowance of certain claims
against the debtor by a codebtor, surety, or guarantor for contribution or reimbursement.

(A) Allowed unsecured claims for domestic support obligations that, as of the date of the
filing of the petition in a case under this title, are owed to or recoverable by a spouse, former
spouse, or child of the debtor, or such child's parent, legal guardian, or responsible relative,
without regard to whether the claim is filed by such person or is filed by a governmental unit on

governmental unit under this title after the date of the filing of the petition shall be applied and
distributed in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law.
(B) Subject to claims under subparagraph (A), allowed unsecured claims for domestic
support obligations that, as of the date of the filing of the petition, are assigned by a spouse,

(E) an excise tax on—
(i) a transaction occurring before the date of the filing of the petition for which a return, if
required, is last due, under applicable law or under any extension, after three years before the

(ii) if a return is not required, a transaction occurring during the three years immediately
preceding the date of the filing of the petition;
(F) a customs duty arising out of the importation of merchandise—
(i) entered for consumption within one year before the date of the filing of the petition;
(ii) covered by an entry liquidated or reliquidated within one year before the date of the

(iii) entered for consumption within four years before the date of the filing of the petition
but unliquidated on such date, if the Secretary of the Treasury certifies that failure to liquidate
such entry was due to an investigation pending on such date into assessment of antidumping
[Release Point 118-106]
or countervailing duties or fraud, or if information needed for the proper appraisement or
classification of such merchandise was not available to the appropriate customs officer before
such date; or
(G) a penalty related to a claim of a kind specified in this paragraph and in compensation for
actual pecuniary loss.
An otherwise applicable time period specified in this paragraph shall be suspended for any period
during which a governmental unit is prohibited under applicable nonbankruptcy law from

action taken or proposed against the debtor, plus 90 days; plus any time during which the stay of
proceedings was in effect in a prior case under this title or during which collection was precluded
by the existence of 1 or more confirmed plans under this title, plus 90 days.
(9) Ninth, allowed unsecured claims based upon any commitment by the debtor to a Federal
depository institutions regulatory agency (or predecessor to such agency) to maintain the capital of
an insured depository institution.
(10) Tenth, allowed claims for death or personal injury resulting from the operation of a motor
vehicle or vessel if such operation was unlawful because the debtor was intoxicated from using
alcohol, a drug, or another substance.
(b) If the trustee, under section 362, 363, or 364 of this title, provides adequate protection of the
interest of a holder of a claim secured by a lien on property of the debtor and if, notwithstanding
such protection, such creditor has a claim allowable under subsection (a)(2) of this section arising
from the stay of action against such property under section 362 of this title, from the use, sale, or
lease of such property under section 363 of this title, or from the granting of a lien under section
364(d) of this title, then such creditor's claim under such subsection shall have priority over every
other claim allowable under such subsection.
(c) For the purpose of subsection (a) of this section, a claim of a governmental unit arising from an
erroneous refund or credit of a tax has the same priority as a claim for the tax to which such refund
or credit relates.
(d) An entity that is subrogated to the rights of a holder of a claim of a kind specified in subsection
(a)(1), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), (a)(7), (a)(8) excluding subparagraph (F), or (a)(9) of this section is not
subrogated to the right of the holder of such claim to priority under such subsection.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 507(a)(3) of the House amendment represents a compromise dollar amount and date for the priority
between similar provisions contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate amendments. A
similar compromise is contained in section 507(a)(4).
Section 507(a)(5) represents a compromise on amount between the priority as contained in H.R. 8200 as
passed by the House and the Senate amendment. The Senate provision for limiting the priority to consumers
having less than a fixed gross income is deleted.
Section 507(a)(6) of the House amendment represents a compromise between similar provisions contained
in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate amendment.
Section 507(b) of the House amendment is new and is derived from the compromise contained in the House
amendment with respect to adequate protection under section 361. Subsection (b) provides that to the extent
[Release Point 118-106]
adequate protection of the interest of a holder of a claim proves to be inadequate, then the creditor's claim is
given priority over every other allowable claim entitled to distribution under section 507(a). Section 507(b) of
the Senate amendment is deleted.
Section 507(c) of the House amendment is new. Section 507(d) of the House amendment prevents
subrogation with respect to priority for certain priority claims. Subrogation with respect to priority is intended
to be permitted for administrative claims and claims arising during the gap period.
Priorities: Under the House amendment, taxes receive priority as follows:
First. Administration expenses: The amendment generally follows the Senate amendment in providing
expressly that taxes incurred during the administration of the estate share the first priority given to
administrative expenses generally. Among the taxes which receives first priority, as defined in section 503, are
the employees' and the employer's shares of employment taxes on wages earned and paid after the petition is
filed. Section 503(b)(1) also includes in administration expenses a tax liability arising from an excessive
allowance by a tax authority of a "quickie refund" to the estate. (In the case of Federal taxes, such refunds are
allowed under special rules based on net operating loss carrybacks (sec. 6411 of the Internal Revenue Code
[title 26]).
An exception is made to first priority treatment for taxes incurred by the estate with regard to the
employer's share of employment taxes on wages earned from the debtor before the petition but paid from the
estate after the petition has been filed. In this situation, the employer's tax receives either sixth priority or
general claim treatment.
The House amendment also adopts the provisions of the Senate amendment which include in the definition
of administrative expenses under section 503 any fine, penalty (including "additions to tax" under applicable
tax laws) or reduction in credit imposed on the estate.
Second. "Involuntary gap" claims: "Involuntary gap" creditors are granted second priority by paragraph (2)
of section 507(a). This priority includes tax claims arising in the ordinary course of the debtor's business or
financial affairs after he has been placed involuntarily in bankruptcy but before a trustee is appointed or before
the order for relief.
Third. Certain taxes on prepetition wages: Wage claims entitled to third priority are for compensation which
does not exceed $2,000 and was earned during the 90 days before the filing of the bankruptcy petition or the
cessation of the debtor's business. Certain employment taxes receive third priority in payment from the estate
along with the payment of wages to which the taxes relate. In the case of wages earned before the filing of the
petition, but paid by the trustee (rather than by the debtor) after the filing of the petition, claims or the
employees' share of the employment taxes (withheld income taxes and the employees' share of the social
security or railroad retirement tax) receive third priority to the extent the wage claims themselves are entitled
to this priority.
In the case of wages earned from and paid by the debtor before the filing of the petition, the employer's
share of the employment taxes on these wages paid by the debtor receives sixth priority or, if not entitled to
that priority, are treated only as general claims. Under the House amendment, the employer's share of
employment taxes on wages earned by employees of the debtor, but paid by the trustee after the filing of the
bankruptcy petition, will also receive sixth priority to the extent that claims for the wages receive third
priority. To the extent the claims for wages do not receive third priority, but instead are treated only as general
claims, claims for the employer's share of the employment taxes attributable to those wages will also be
treated as general claims. In calculating the amounts payable as general wage claims, the trustee must pay the
employer's share of employment taxes on such wages.
Sixth priority. The House amendment modifies the provisions of both the House bill and Senate amendment
in the case of sixth priority taxes. Under the amendment, the following Federal, State and local taxes are
included in the sixth priority:
First. Income and gross receipts taxes incurred before the date of the petition for which the last due date of
the return, including all extensions of time granted to file the return, occurred within 3 years before the date on
which the petition was filed, or after the petition date. Under this rule, the due date of the return, rather than
the date on which the taxes were assessed, determines the priority.
Second. Income and gross receipts taxes assessed at any time within 240 days before the petition date.
Under this rule, the date on which the governmental unit assesses the tax, rather than the due date of the
return, determines the priority.
If, following assessment of a tax, the debtor submits an offer in compromise to the governmental unit, the
House amendment provides that the 240-day period is to be suspended for the duration of the offer and will
resume running after the offer is withdrawn or rejected by the governmental unit, but the tax liability will
receive priority if the title 11 petition is filed during the balance of the 240-day period or during a minimum of
30 days after the offer is withdrawn or rejected. This rule modifies a provision of the Senate amendment
[Release Point 118-106]
dealing specifically with offers in compromise. Under the modified rule, if, after the assessment, an offer in
compromise is submitted by the debtor and is still pending (without having been accepted or rejected) at the
date on which a title 11 petition is filed, the underlying liability will receive sixth priority. However, if an
assessment of a tax liability is made but the tax is not collected within 240 days, the tax will not receive
priority under section 507(a)(6)(A)(i) and the debtor cannot revive a priority for that tax by submitting an
offer in compromise.
Third. Income and gross receipts taxes not assessed before the petition date but still permitted, under
otherwise applicable tax laws, to be assessed. Thus, for example, a prepetition tax liability is to receive sixth
priority under this rule if, under the applicable statute of limitations, the tax liability can still be assessed by
the tax authority. This rule also covers situations referred to in section 507(a)(6)(B)(ii) of the Senate
amendment where the assessment or collection of a tax was prohibited before the petition pending exhaustion
of judicial or administrative remedies, except that the House amendment eliminates the 300-day limitation of
the Senate bill. So, for example, if before the petition a debtor was engaged in litigation in the Tax Court,
during which the Internal Revenue Code [title 26] bars the Internal Revenue Service from assessing or
collecting the tax, and if the tax court decision is made in favor of the Service before the petition under title 11
is filed, thereby lifting the restrictions on assessment and collection, the tax liability will receive sixth priority
even if the tax authority does not make an assessment within 300 days before the petition (provided, of course,
that the statute of limitations on assessment has not expired by the petition date).
In light of the above categories of the sixth priority, and tax liability of the debtor (under the Internal
Revenue Code [title 26] or State or local law) as a transferee of property from another person will receive
sixth priority without the limitations contained in the Senate amendment so long as the transferee liability had
not been assessed by the tax authority by the petition date but could still have been assessed by that date under
the applicable tax statute of limitations or, if the transferee liability had been assessed before the petition, the
assessment was made no more than 240 days before the petition date.
Also in light of the above categories, the treatment of prepetition tax liabilities arising from an excessive
allowance to the debtor of a tentative carryback adjustment, such as a "quickie refund" under section 6411 of
the Internal Revenue Code [title 26] is revised as follows: If the tax authority has assessed the additional tax
before the petition, the tax liability will receive priority if the date of assessment was within 240 days before
the petition date. If the tax authority had not assessed the additional tax by the petition, the tax liability will
still receive priority so long as, on the petition date, assessment of the liability is not barred by the statute of
limitations.
Fourth. Any property tax assessed before the commencement of the case and last payable without penalty
within 1 year before the petition, or thereafter.
Fifth. Taxes which the debtor was required by law to withhold or collect from others and for which he is
liable in any capacity, regardless of the age of the tax claims. This category covers the so-called "trust fund"
taxes, that is, income taxes which an employer is required to withhold from the pay of his employees, and the
employees' share of social security taxes.
In addition, this category includes the liability of a responsible officer under the Internal Revenue Code
(sec. 6672) [title 26] for income taxes or for the employees' share of social security taxes which that officer
was responsible for withholding from the wages of employees and paying to the Treasury, although he was
not himself the employer. This priority will operate when a person found to be a responsible officer has
himself filed in title 11, and the priority will cover the debtor's responsible officer liability regardless of the
age of the tax year to which the tax relates. The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted present law to require the
same result as will be reached under this rule. U.S. v. Sotelo, 436 U.S. 268 (1978) [98 S.Ct. 1795, 56 L.Ed.2d
275, rehearing denied 98 S.Ct. 3126, 438 U.S. 907, 57 L.Ed.2d 1150].
This category also includes the liability under section 3505 of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 3505]
of a taxpayer who loans money for the payment of wages or other compensation.
Sixth. The employer's share of employment taxes on wages paid before the petition and on third-priority
wages paid postpetition by the estate. The priority rules under the House amendment governing employment
taxes can thus be summarized as follows: Claims for the employees' shares of employment taxes attributable
to wages both earned and paid before the filing of the petition are to receive sixth priority. In the case of
employee wages earned, but not paid, before the filing of the bankruptcy petition, claims for the employees'
share of employment taxes receive third priority to the extent the wages themselves receive third priority.
Claims which relate to wages earned before the petition, but not paid before the petition (and which are not
entitled to the third priority under the rule set out above), will be paid as general claims. Since the related
wages will receive no priority, the related employment taxes would also be paid as nonpriority general claims.
The employer's share of the employment taxes on wages earned and paid before the bankruptcy petition
will receive sixth priority to the extent the return for these taxes was last due (including extensions of time)
[Release Point 118-106]
within 3 years before the filing of the petition, or was due after the petition was filed. Older tax claims of this
nature will be payable as general claims. In the case of wages earned by employees before the petition, but
actually paid by the trustee (as claims against the estate) after the title 11 case commenced, the employer's
share of the employment taxes on third priority wages will be payable as sixth priority claims and the
employer's taxes on prepetition wages which are treated only as general claims will be payable only as general
claims. In calculating the amounts payable as general wage claims, the trustee must pay the employer's share
of employment taxes on such wages. The House amendment thus deletes the provision of the Senate
amendment that certain employer taxes receive third priority and are to be paid immediately after payment of
third priority wages and the employees' shares of employment taxes on those wages.
In the case of employment taxes relating to wages earned and paid after the petition, both the employees'
shares and the employer's share will receive first priority as administration expenses of the estate.
Seventh. Excise taxes on transactions for which a return, if required, is last due, under otherwise applicable
law or under any extension of time to file the return, within 3 years before the petition was filed, or thereafter.
If a return is not required with regard to a particular excise tax, priority is given if the transaction or event
itself occurred within 3 years before the date on which the title 11 petition was filed. All Federal, State or local
taxes generally considered or expressly treated as excises are covered by this category, including sales taxes,
estate and gift taxes, gasoline and special fuel taxes, and wagering and truck taxes.
Eighth. Certain unpaid customs duties. The House amendment covers in this category duties on imports
entered for consumption within 1 year before the filing of the petition, but which are still unliquidated on the
petition date; duties covered by an entry liquidated or reliquidated within 1 year before the petition date; and
any duty on merchandise entered for consumption within 4 years before the petition but not liquidated on the
petition date, if the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate certifies that duties were not liquidated because
of possible assessment of antidumping or countervailing duties or fraud penalties.
For purposes of the above priority rules, the House amendment adopts the provision of the Senate bill that
any tax liability which, under otherwise applicable tax law, is collectible in the form of a "penalty," is to be
treated in the same manner as a tax liability. In bankruptcy terminology, such tax liabilities are referred to as
pecuniary loss penalties. Thus, any tax liability which under the Internal Revenue Code [title 26] or State or
local tax law is payable as a "penalty," in addition to the liability of a responsible person under section 6672 of
the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 6672] will be entitled to the priority which the liability would receive if
it were expressly labeled as a "tax" under the applicable tax law. However, a tax penalty which is punitive in
nature is given subordinated treatment under section 726(a)(4).
The House amendment also adopts the provision of the Senate amendment that a claim arising from an
erroneous refund or credit of tax, other than a "quickie refund," is to receive the same priority as the tax to
which the refund or credit relates.
The House amendment deletes the express provision of the Senate amendment that a tax liability is to
receive sixth priority if it satisfies any one of the subparagraphs of section 507(a)(6) even if the liability fails
to satisfy the terms of one or more other subparagraphs. No change of substance is intended by the deletion,
however, in light of section 102(5) of the House amendment, providing a rule of construction that the word
"or" is not intended to be exclusive.
The House amendment deletes from the express priority categories of the Senate amendment the priority for
a debtor's liability as a third party for failing to surrender property or to pay an obligation in response to a levy
for taxes of another, and the priority for amounts provided for under deferred payment agreements between a
debtor and the tax authority.
The House amendment also adopts the substance of the definition in section 346(a) the Senate amendment
of when taxes are to be considered "incurred" except that the House amendment applies these definitions
solely for purposes of determining which category of section 507 tests the priority of a particular tax liability.
Thus, for example, the House amendment contains a special rule for the treatment of taxes under the 45-day
exception to the preference rules under section 547 and the definitions of when a tax is incurred for priority
purposes are not to apply to such preference rules. Under the House amendment, for purposes of the priority
rules, a tax on income for a particular period is to be considered "incurred" on the last day of the period. A tax
on or measured by some event, such as the payment of wages or a transfer by reason of death or gift, or an
excise tax on a sale or other transaction, is to be considered "incurred" on the date of the transaction or event.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 507 specifies the kinds of claims that are entitled to priority in distribution, and the order of their
priority. Paragraph (1) grants first priority to allowed administrative expenses and to fees and charges assessed
against the estate under chapter 123 [§1911 et seq.] of title 28. Taxes included as administrative expenses
under section 503(b)(1) of the bill generally receive the first priority, but the bill makes certain qualifications:
[Release Point 118-106]
Examples of these specially treated claims are the estate's liability for recapture of an investment tax credit
claimed by the debtor before the title 11 case (this liability receives sixth priority) and the estate's employment
tax liabilities on wages earned before, but paid after, the petition was filed (this liability generally receives the
same priority as the wages).
"Involuntary gap" creditors, granted first priority under current law, are granted second priority by
paragraph (2). This priority, covering claims arising in the ordinary course of the debtor's business or financial
affairs after a title 11 case has begun but before a trustee is appointed or before the order for relief, includes
taxes incurred during the conduct of such activities.
Paragraph (3) expands and increases the wage priority found in current section 64a(2) [section 104(a)(2) of
former title 11]. The amount entitled to priority is raised from $600 to $1,800. The former figure was last
adjusted in 1926. Inflation has made it nearly meaningless, and the bill brings it more than up to date. The
three month limit of current law is retained, but is modified to run from the earlier of the date of the filing of
the petition or the date of the cessation of the debtor's business. The priority is expanded to cover vacation,
severance, and sick leave pay. The bill adds to the third priority so-called "trust fund" taxes, that is, withheld
income taxes and the employees' share of the social security or railroad retirement taxes, but only to the extent
that the wages on which taxes are imposed are themselves entitled to third priority.
The employer's share, the employment tax and the employer's share of the social security or railroad
retirement tax on third priority compensation, is also included in the third priority category, but only if, and to
the extent that the wages and related trust fund taxes have first been paid in full. Because of the claimants
urgent need for their wages in the typical cases, the employer's taxes should not be paid before the wage
claims entitled to priority, as well as the related trust fund taxes, are fully paid.
Paragraph (4) overrules United States v. Embassy Restaurant, 359 U.S. 29 (1958), which held that fringe
benefits were not entitled to wage priority status. The bill recognizes the realities of labor contract
negotiations, where fringe benefits may be substituted for wage demands. The priority granted is limited to
claims for contributions to employee benefit plans such as pension plans, health or life insurance plans, and
others, arising from services rendered within 120 days before the commencement of the case or the date of
cessation of the debtor's business, whichever occurs first. The dollar limit placed on the total of all
contributions payable under this paragraph is equal to the difference between the maximum allowable priority
under paragraph (3), $1,800, times the number of employees covered by the plan less the actual distributions
under paragraph (3) with respect to these employees.
Paragraph (5) is a new priority for consumer creditors—those who have deposited money in connection
with the purchase, lease, or rental of property, or the purchase of services, for their personal, family, or
household use, that were not delivered or provided. The priority amount is not to exceed $600. In order to
reach only those persons most deserving of this special priority, it is limited to individuals whose adjustable
gross income from all sources derived does not exceed $20,000. See Senate Hearings, testimony of Prof. Vern
Countryman, at pp. 848–849. The income of the husband and wife should be aggregated for the purposes of
the $20,000 limit if either or both spouses assert such a priority claim.
The sixth priority is for certain taxes. Priority is given to income taxes for a taxable year that ended on or
before the date of the filing of the petition, if the last due date of the return for such year occurred not more
than 3 years immediately before the date on which the petition was filed (§507(a)(6)(A)(i)). For the purposes
of this rule, the last due date of the return is the last date under any extension of time to file the return which
the taxing authority may have granted the debtor.
Employment taxes and transfer taxes (including gift, estate, sales, use and other excise taxes) are also given
sixth priority if the transaction or event which gave rise to the tax occurred before the petition date, provided
that the required return or report of such tax liabilities was last due within 3 years before the petition was filed
or was last due after the petition date (§507(a)(6)(A)(ii)). The employment taxes covered under this rule are
the employer's share of the social security and railroad retirement taxes and required employer payments
toward unemployment insurance.
Priority is given to income taxes and other taxes of a kind described in section 507(a)(6)(A)(i) and (ii)
which the Federal, State, or local tax authority had assessed within 3 years after the last due date of the return,
that is, including any extension of time to file the return, if the debtor filed in title 11 within 240 days after the
assessment was made (§507(a)(6)(B)(i)). This rule may bring into the sixth priority the debtor's tax liability
for some taxable years which would not qualify for priority under the general three-year rule of section
507(a)(6)(A).
The sixth priority category also includes taxes which the tax authority was barred by law from assessing or
collecting at any time during the 300 days before the petition under title 11 was filed (§507(a)(6)(B)(ii)). In
the case of certain Federal taxes, this preserves a priority for tax liabilities for years more than three years
before the filing of the petition where the debtor and the Internal Revenue Service were negotiating over an
[Release Point 118-106]
audit of the debtor's returns or were engaged in litigation in the Tax Court. In such situations, the tax law
prohibits the service's right to assess a tax deficiency until ninety days after the service sends the taxpayer a
deficiency letter or, if the taxpayer files a petition in the Tax Court during that 90-day period, until the
outcome of the litigation. A similar priority exists in present law, except that the taxing authority is allowed no
time to assess and collect the taxes after the restrictions on assessment (discussed above) are lifted. Some
taxpayers have exploited this loophole by filing in bankruptcy immediately after the end of the 90-day period
or immediately after the close of Tax Court proceedings. The bill remedies this defect by preserving a priority
for taxes the assessment of which was barred by law by giving the tax authority 300 days within which to
make the assessment after the lifting of the bar and then to collect or file public notice of its tax lien. Thus, if a
taxpayer files a title 11 petition at any time during that 300-day period, the tax deficiency will be entitled to
priority. If the petition is filed more than 300 days after the restriction on assessment was lifted, the taxing
authority will not have priority for the tax deficiency.
Taxes for which an offer in compromise was withdrawn by the debtor, or rejected by a governmental unit,
within 240 days before the petition date (§507(a)(6)(B)(iii)) will also receive sixth priority. This rule closes a
loophole under present law under which, following an assessment of tax, some taxpayers have submitted a
formal offer in compromise, dragged out negotiations with the taxing authority until the tax liability would
lose priority under the three-year priority period of present law, and then filed in bankruptcy before the
governmental unit could take collection steps.
Also included are certain taxes for which no return or report is required by law (§507(a)(6)(C)), if the
taxable transaction occurred within three years before the petition was filed.
Taxes (not covered by the third priority) which the debtor was required by law to withhold or collect from
others and for which he is liable in any capacity, regardless of the age of the tax claims (§507(a)(6)(D)) are
included. This category covers the so-called "trust fund" taxes, that is, income taxes which an employer is
required to withhold from the pay of his employees, the employees' shares of social security and railroad
retirement taxes, and also Federal unemployment insurance. This category also includes excise taxes which a
seller of goods or services is required to collect from a buyer and pay over to a taxing authority.
This category also covers the liability of a responsible corporate officer under the Internal Revenue Code
[title 26] for income taxes or for the employees' share of employment taxes which, under the tax law, the
employer was required to withhold from the wages of employees. This priority will operate where a person
found to be a responsible officer has himself filed a petition under title 11, and the priority covers the debtor's
liability as an officer under the Internal Revenue Code, regardless of the age of the tax year to which the tax
relates.
The priority rules under the bill governing employment taxes can be summarized as follows: In the case of
wages earned and actually paid before the petition under title 11 was filed, the liability for the employees'
share of the employment taxes, regardless of the prepetition year in which the wages were earned and paid.
The employer's share of the employment taxes on all wages earned and paid before the petition receive sixth
priority; generally, these taxes will be those for which a return was due within three years before the petition.
With respect to wages earned by employees before the petition but actually paid by the trustee after the title 11
case commenced, taxes required to be withheld receives the same priority as the wages themselves. Thus, the
employees' share of taxes on third priority wages also receives third priority. Taxes on the balance of such
wages receive no priority and are collectible only as general claims because the wages themselves are payable
only as general claims and liability for the taxes arises only to the extent the wages are actually paid. The
employer's share of employment taxes on third priority wages earned before the petition but paid after the
petition was filed receives third priority, but only if the wages in this category have first been paid in full.
Assuming there are sufficient funds to pay third priority wages and the related employer taxes in full, the
employer's share of taxes on the balance of wage payments becomes a general claim (because the wages
themselves are payable as general claims). Both the employees' and the employer's share of employment taxes
on wages earned and paid after the petition was filed receive first priority as administrative expenses.
Also covered by this sixth priority are property taxes required to be assessed within 3 years before the filing
of the petition (§507(a)(6)(E)).
Taxes attributable to a tentative carryback adjustment received by the debtor before the petition was filed,
such as a "quickie refund" received under section 6411 of the Internal Revenue Code [title 26] (§507(a)(6)(F))
are included. However, the tax claim against the debtor will rein a prepetition loss year for which the tax
return was last due, including extensions, within 3 years before the petition was filed.
Taxes resulting from a recapture, occasioned by a transfer during bankruptcy, of a tax credit or deduction
taken during an earlier tax year (§507(a)(6)(G)) are included. A typical example occurs when there is a sale by
the trustee of depreciable property during the case and depreciation deductions taken in prepetition years are
subject to recapture under section 1250 of the Code [title 26].
[Release Point 118-106]
Taxes owed by the debtor as a transferee of assets from another person who is liable for a tax, if the tax
claim against the transferor would have received priority in a chapter 11 case commenced by the transferor
within 1 year before the date of the petition filed by the transferee (§507(a)(6)(H)), are included.
Also included are certain tax payments required to have been made during the 1 year immediately before
the petition was filed, where the debtor had previously entered into a deferred payment agreement (including
an offer in compromise) to pay an agreed liability in periodic installments but had become delinquent in one
or more installments before the petition was filed (§507(a)(6)(I)). This priority covers all types of deferred or
part payment agreements. The priority covers only installments which first became due during the 1 year
before the petition but which remained unpaid at the date of the petition. The priority does not come into play,
however, if before the case began or during the case, the debtor and the taxing authority agree to a further
extension of time to pay the delinquent amounts.
Certain tax-related liabilities which are not true taxes or which are not collected by regular assessment
procedures (§507(a)(6)(J)) are included. One type of liability covered in this category is the liability under
section 3505 of the Internal Revenue Code [title 26] of a lender who pays wages directly to employees of
another employer or who supplies funds to an employer for the payment of wages. Another is the liability
under section 6332 of the Internal Revenue Code [title 26], of a person who fails to turn over money or
property of the taxpayer in response to a levy. Since the taxing authority must collect such a liability from the
third party by suit rather than normal assessment procedures, an extra year is added to the normal 3-year
priority periods. If a suit was commenced by the taxing authority within the four-year period and before the
petition was filed, the priority is also preserved, provided that the suit had not terminated more than 1 year
before the date of the filing of the petition.
Also included are certain unpaid customs duties which have not grown unreasonably "stale"
(§507(a)(6)(K)). These include duties on imports entered for consumption with 3 years before the filing of the
petition if the duties are still unliquidated on the petition date. If an import entry has been liquidated (in
general, liquidation is in an administrative determination of the value and tariff rate of the item) or
reliquidated, within two years of the filing of the petition the customs liability is given priority. If the
Secretary of the Treasury certifies that customs duties were not liquidated because of an investigation into
possible assessment of antidumping or countervailing duties, or because of fraud penalties, duties not
liquidated for this reason during the five years before the importer filed under title 11 also will receive
priority.
Subsection (a) of this section also provides specifically that interest on sixth priority tax claims accrued
before the filing of the petition is also entitled to sixth priority.
Subsection (b) of this section provides that any fine or penalty which represents compensation for actual
pecuniary loss of a governmental unit, and which involves a tax liability entitled to sixth priority, is to receive
the same priority.
Subsection (b) also provides that a claim arising from an erroneous refund or credit of tax is to be given the
same priority as the tax to which the refund or credit relates.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 509 of the House amendment represents a substantial revision of provisions contained in H.R. 8200
as passed by the House and in the Senate amendment. Section 509(a) states a general rule that a surety or
co-debtor is subrogated to the rights of a creditor assured by the surety or co-debtor to the extent the surety or
co-debtor pays such creditor. Section 509(b) states a general exception indicating that subrogation is not
granted to the extent that a claim of a surety or co-debtor for reimbursement or contribution is allowed under
section 502 or disallowed other than under section 502(e). Additionally, section 509(b)(1)(C) provides that
such claims for subrogation are subordinated to the extent that a claim of the surety or co-debtor for
reimbursement or contribution is subordinated under section 510(a)(1) or 510(b). Section 509(b)(2) reiterates
the well-known rule that prevents a debtor that is ultimately liable on the debt from recovering from a surety
or a co-debtor. Although the language in section 509(b)(2) focuses in terms of receipt of consideration,
legislative history appearing elsewhere indicates that an agreement to share liabilities should prevail over an
agreement to share profits throughout title 11. This is particularly important in the context of co-debtors who
are partners. Section 509(c) subordinates the claim of a surety or co-debtor to the claim of an assured creditor
until the creditor's claim is paid in full.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 509 deals with codebtors generally, and is in addition to the disallowance provision in section
502(e). This section is based on the notion that the only rights available to a surety, guarantor, or comaker are
contribution, reimbursement, and subrogation. The right that applies in a particular situation will depend on
the agreement between the debtor and the codebtor, and on whether and how payment was made by the
codebtor to the creditor. The claim of a surety or codebtor for contribution or reimbursement is discharged
even if the claim is never filed, as is any claim for subrogation even if the surety or codebtor chooses to file a
claim for contribution or reimbursement instead.
Subsection (a) subrogates the codebtor (whether as a codebtor, surety, or guarantor) to the rights of the
creditor, to the extent of any payment made by the codebtor to the creditor. Whether the creditor's claim was
filed under section 501(a) or 501(b) is irrelevant. The right of subrogation will exist even if the primary
creditor's claim is allowed by virtue of being listed under proposed 11 U.S.C. 924 or 1111, and not by reason
of a proof of claim.
Subsection (b) permits a subrogated codebtor to receive payments in the bankruptcy case only if the creditor
has been paid in full, either through payments under the bankruptcy code or otherwise.

of such a claim, shall be subordinated to all claims or interests that are senior to or equal the claim or
interest represented by such security, except that if such security is common stock, such claim has
the same priority as common stock.

part of an allowed claim to all or part of another allowed claim or all or part of an allowed interest
to all or part of another allowed interest; or
(2) order that any lien securing such a subordinated claim be transferred to the estate.

375.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 510(c)(1) of the House amendment represents a compromise between similar provisions in the
House bill and Senate amendment. After notice and a hearing, the court may, under principles of equitable
subordination, subordinate for purposes of distribution all or part of an allowed claim to all or part of another
allowed claim or all or part of an allowed interest to all or part of another allowed interest. As a matter of
equity, it is reasonable that a court subordinate claims to claims and interests to interests. It is intended that the
term "principles of equitable subordination" follow existing case law and leave to the courts development of
this principle. To date, under existing law, a claim is generally subordinated only if holder of such claim is
guilty of inequitable conduct, or the claim itself is of a status susceptible to subordination, such as a penalty or
a claim for damages arising from the purchase or sale of a security of the debtor. The fact that such a claim
may be secured is of no consequence to the issue of subordination. However, it is inconceivable that the status
of a claim as a secured claim could ever be grounds for justifying equitable subordination.
Subordination: Since the House amendment authorizes subordination of claims only under principles of
equitable subordination, and thus incorporates principles of existing case law, a tax claim would rarely be
subordinated under this provision of the bill.
Section 511 of the Senate amendment is deleted. Its substance is adopted in section 502(b)(9) of the House
amendment which reflects an identical provision contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) requires the court to enforce subordination agreements. A subordination agreement will not
be enforced, however, in a reorganization case in which the class that is the beneficiary of the agreement has
accepted, as specified in proposed 11 U.S.C. 1126, a plan that waives their rights under the agreement.
Otherwise, the agreement would prevent just what chapter 11 contemplates: that seniors may give up rights to
juniors in the interest of confirmation of a plan and rehabilitation of the debtor. The subsection also requires
the court to subordinate in payment any claim for rescission of a purchase or sale of a security of the debtor or
of an affiliate, or for damages arising from the purchase or sale of such a security, to all claims and interests
that are senior to the claim or interest represented by the security. Thus, the later subordination varies with the
claim or interest involved. If the security is a debt instrument, the damages or rescission claim will be granted
the status of a general unsecured claim. If the security is an equity security, the damages or rescission claim is
subordinated to all creditors and treated the same as the equity security itself.
Subsection (b) authorizes the bankruptcy court, in ordering distribution of assets, to subordinate all or any
part of any claim to all or any part of another claim, regardless of the priority ranking of either claim. In
addition, any lien securing such a subordinated claim may be transferred to the estate. The bill provides,
[Release Point 118-106]
however, that any subordination ordered under this provision must be based on principles of equitable
subordination. These principles are defined by case law, and have generally indicated that a claim may
normally be subordinated only if its holder is guilty of misconduct. As originally introduced, the bill provided
specifically that a tax claim may not be subordinated on equitable grounds. The bill deletes this express
exception, but the effect under the amendment should be much the same in most situations since, under the
judicial doctrine of equitable subordination, a tax claim would rarely be subordinated.

(5) appear at the hearing required under section 524(d) of this title;
(6) in a case under chapter 7 of this title in which the debtor is an individual, not retain
possession of personal property as to which a creditor has an allowed claim for the purchase price
secured in whole or in part by an interest in such personal property unless the debtor, not later than
45 days after the first meeting of creditors under section 341(a), either—
(A) enters into an agreement with the creditor pursuant to section 524(c) with respect to the
claim secured by such property; or
(B) redeems such property from the security interest pursuant to section 722; and
(7) unless a trustee is serving in the case, continue to perform the obligations required of the
administrator (as defined in section 3 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974)
of an employee benefit plan if at the time of the commencement of the case the debtor (or any
entity designated by the debtor) served as such administrator.
If the debtor fails to so act within the 45-day period referred to in paragraph (6), the stay under
section 362(a) is terminated with respect to the personal property of the estate or of the debtor which
is affected, such property shall no longer be property of the estate, and the creditor may take
whatever action as to such property as is permitted by applicable nonbankruptcy law, unless the
court determines on the motion of the trustee filed before the expiration of such 45-day period, and
[Release Point 118-106]
after notice and a hearing, that such property is of consequential value or benefit to the estate, orders
appropriate adequate protection of the creditor's interest, and orders the debtor to deliver any
collateral in the debtor's possession to the trustee.
(b) In addition to the requirements under subsection (a), a debtor who is an individual shall file
with the court—
(1) a certificate from the approved nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency that provided

(c) In addition to meeting the requirements under subsection (a), a debtor shall file with the court a
record of any interest that a debtor has in an education individual retirement account (as defined in
section 530(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), an interest in an account in a qualified
ABLE program (as defined in section 529A(b) of such Code,1 or under a qualified State tuition
program (as defined in section 529(b)(1) of such Code).
(d) If the debtor fails timely to take the action specified in subsection (a)(6) of this section, or in
paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 362(h), with respect to property which a lessor or bailor owns and
has leased, rented, or bailed to the debtor or as to which a creditor holds a security interest not
otherwise voidable under section 522(f), 544, 545, 547, 548, or 549, nothing in this title shall prevent
or limit the operation of a provision in the underlying lease or agreement that has the effect of
placing the debtor in default under such lease or agreement by reason of the occurrence, pendency, or
existence of a proceeding under this title or the insolvency of the debtor. Nothing in this subsection
shall be deemed to justify limiting such a provision in any other circumstance.

court at any time a request to receive a copy of the petition, schedules, and statement of financial
affairs filed by the debtor, then the court shall make such petition, such schedules, and such
statement available to such creditor.
(2)(A) The debtor shall provide—
(i) not later than 7 days before the date first set for the first meeting of creditors, to the trustee a

commencement of the case and for which a Federal income tax return was filed; and
(ii) at the same time the debtor complies with clause (i), a copy of such return (or if elected
under clause (i), such transcript) to any creditor that timely requests such copy.
(B) If the debtor fails to comply with clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A), the court shall dismiss
the case unless the debtor demonstrates that the failure to so comply is due to circumstances beyond

provide a copy of such tax return or such transcript to such creditor at the time the debtor provides
such tax return or such transcript to the trustee, then the court shall dismiss the case unless the debtor
demonstrates that the failure to provide a copy of such tax return or such transcript is due to
circumstances beyond the control of the debtor.
(3) If a creditor in a case under chapter 13 files with the court at any time a request to receive a

(B) not later than 7 days after such request is filed.
(f) At the request of the court, the United States trustee, or any party in interest in a case under
chapter 7, 11, or 13, a debtor who is an individual shall file with the court—

subsequently filed for any tax year of the debtor ending in the 3-year period ending on the date of
the commencement of the case;
(3) a copy of each amendment to any Federal income tax return or transcript filed with the court
under paragraph (1) or (2); and
(4) in a case under chapter 13—
(A) on the date that is either 90 days after the end of such tax year or 1 year after the date of
the commencement of the case, whichever is later, if a plan is not confirmed before such later
date; and
(B) annually after the plan is confirmed and until the case is closed, not later than the date
that is 45 days before the anniversary of the confirmation of the plan;
a statement, under penalty of perjury, of the income and expenditures of the debtor during the tax
year of the debtor most recently concluded before such statement is filed under this paragraph, and

(A) the amount and sources of the income of the debtor;
(B) the identity of any person responsible with the debtor for the support of any dependent of
the debtor; and
(C) the identity of any person who contributed, and the amount contributed, to the household in
which the debtor resides.
(2) The tax returns, amendments, and statement of income and expenditures described in

(h) If requested by the United States trustee or by the trustee, the debtor shall provide—
(1) a document that establishes the identity of the debtor, including a driver's license, passport,
or other document that contains a photograph of the debtor; or
(2) such other personal identifying information relating to the debtor that establishes the identity
of the debtor.
(i)(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (4) and notwithstanding section 707(a), if an individual debtor
in a voluntary case under chapter 7 or 13 fails to file all of the information required under subsection
(a)(1) within 45 days after the date of the filing of the petition, the case shall be automatically
dismissed effective on the 46th day after the date of the filing of the petition.
(2) Subject to paragraph (4) and with respect to a case described in paragraph (1), any party in
interest may request the court to enter an order dismissing the case. If requested, the court shall enter
an order of dismissal not later than 7 days after such request.
(3) Subject to paragraph (4) and upon request of the debtor made within 45 days after the date of
the filing of the petition described in paragraph (1), the court may allow the debtor an additional
period of not to exceed 45 days to file the information required under subsection (a)(1) if the court
finds justification for extending the period for the filing.
(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, on the motion of the trustee filed
before the expiration of the applicable period of time specified in paragraph (1), (2), or (3), and after
[Release Point 118-106]
notice and a hearing, the court may decline to dismiss the case if the court finds that the debtor
attempted in good faith to file all the information required by subsection (a)(1)(B)(iv) and that the
best interests of creditors would be served by administration of the case.
(j)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, if the debtor fails to file a tax return that
becomes due after the commencement of the case or to properly obtain an extension of the due date
for filing such return, the taxing authority may request that the court enter an order converting or
dismissing the case.
(2) If the debtor does not file the required return or obtain the extension referred to in paragraph

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 521 of the House amendment modifies a comparable provision contained in the House bill and
Senate amendment. The Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure should provide where the list of creditors is to be
filed. In addition, the debtor is required to attend the hearing on discharge under section 524(d).
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section lists three duties of the debtor in a bankruptcy case. The Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure will
specify the means of carrying out these duties. The first duty is to file with the court a list of creditors and,
unless the court orders otherwise, a schedule of assets and liabilities and a statement of his financial affairs.
Second, the debtor is required to cooperate with the trustee as necessary to enable the trustee to perform the
trustee's duties. Finally, the debtor must surrender to the trustee all property of the estate, and any recorded
information, including books, documents, records, and papers, relating to property of the estate. This phrase
"recorded information, including books, documents, records, and papers," has been used here and throughout
the bill as a more general term, and includes such other forms of recorded information as data in computer
storage or in other machine readable forms.
The list in this section is not exhaustive of the debtor's duties. Others are listed elsewhere in proposed title
11, such as in section 343, which requires the debtor to submit to examination, or in the Rules of Bankruptcy
Procedure, as continued by §404(a) of S. 2266, such as the duty to attend any hearing on discharge, Rule
402(2).

§522. Exemptions
(a) In this section—
(1) "dependent" includes spouse, whether or not actually dependent; and
(2) "value" means fair market value as of the date of the filing of the petition or, with respect to
property that becomes property of the estate after such date, as of the date such property becomes
property of the estate.
(b)(1) Notwithstanding section 541 of this title, an individual debtor may exempt from property of
the estate the property listed in either paragraph (2) or, in the alternative, paragraph (3) of this
subsection. In joint cases filed under section 302 of this title and individual cases filed under section
301 or 303 of this title by or against debtors who are husband and wife, and whose estates are
ordered to be jointly administered under Rule 1015(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure,
one debtor may not elect to exempt property listed in paragraph (2) and the other debtor elect to
exempt property listed in paragraph (3) of this subsection. If the parties cannot agree on the
alternative to be elected, they shall be deemed to elect paragraph (2), where such election is
permitted under the law of the jurisdiction where the case is filed.
(2) Property listed in this paragraph is property that is specified under subsection (d), unless the
[Release Point 118-106]
State law that is applicable to the debtor under paragraph (3)(A) specifically does not so authorize.
(3) Property listed in this paragraph is—
(A) subject to subsections (o) and (p), any property that is exempt under Federal law, other than
subsection (d) of this section, or State or local law that is applicable on the date of the filing of the
petition to the place in which the debtor's domicile has been located for the 730 days immediately
preceding the date of the filing of the petition or if the debtor's domicile has not been located in a
single State for such 730-day period, the place in which the debtor's domicile was located for 180
days immediately preceding the 730-day period or for a longer portion of such 180-day period
than in any other place;
(B) any interest in property in which the debtor had, immediately before the commencement of
the case, an interest as a tenant by the entirety or joint tenant to the extent that such interest as a
tenant by the entirety or joint tenant is exempt from process under applicable nonbankruptcy law;
and
(C) retirement funds to the extent that those funds are in a fund or account that is exempt from
taxation under section 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457, or 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986.
If the effect of the domiciliary requirement under subparagraph (A) is to render the debtor
ineligible for any exemption, the debtor may elect to exempt property that is specified under
subsection (d).
(4) For purposes of paragraph (3)(C) and subsection (d)(12), the following shall apply:
(A) If the retirement funds are in a retirement fund that has received a favorable determination
under section 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and that determination is in effect as of
the date of the filing of the petition in a case under this title, those funds shall be presumed to be
exempt from the estate.
(B) If the retirement funds are in a retirement fund that has not received a favorable
determination under such section 7805, those funds are exempt from the estate if the debtor
demonstrates that—
(i) no prior determination to the contrary has been made by a court or the Internal Revenue
Service; and
(ii)(I) the retirement fund is in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or
(II) the retirement fund fails to be in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the debtor is not materially responsible for that
failure.
(C) A direct transfer of retirement funds from 1 fund or account that is exempt from taxation
under section 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457, or 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
under section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or otherwise, shall not cease to
qualify for exemption under paragraph (3)(C) or subsection (d)(12) by reason of such direct
transfer.
(D)(i) Any distribution that qualifies as an eligible rollover distribution within the meaning of
section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or that is described in clause (ii) shall not
cease to qualify for exemption under paragraph (3)(C) or subsection (d)(12) by reason of such
distribution.
(ii) A distribution described in this clause is an amount that—
(I) has been distributed from a fund or account that is exempt from taxation under section
401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457, or 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and
(II) to the extent allowed by law, is deposited in such a fund or account not later than 60 days
after the distribution of such amount.
(c) Unless the case is dismissed, property exempted under this section is not liable during or after
the case for any debt of the debtor that arose, or that is determined under section 502 of this title as if
[Release Point 118-106]
such debt had arisen, before the commencement of the case, except—
(1) a debt of a kind specified in paragraph (1) or (5) of section 523(a) (in which case,
notwithstanding any provision of applicable nonbankruptcy law to the contrary, such property
shall be liable for a debt of a kind specified in such paragraph);
(2) a debt secured by a lien that is—
(A)(i) not avoided under subsection (f) or (g) of this section or under section 544, 545, 547,

(B) a tax lien, notice of which is properly filed;
(3) a debt of a kind specified in section 523(a)(4) or 523(a)(6) of this title owed by an
institution-affiliated party of an insured depository institution to a Federal depository institutions
regulatory agency acting in its capacity as conservator, receiver, or liquidating agent for such
institution; or
(4) a debt in connection with fraud in the obtaining or providing of any scholarship, grant, loan,
tuition, discount, award, or other financial assistance for purposes of financing an education at an
institution of higher education (as that term is defined in section 101 of the Higher Education Act
of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001)).
(d) The following property may be exempted under subsection (b)(2) of this section:
(1) The debtor's aggregate interest, not to exceed $15,000 1 in value, in real property or personal

(8) The debtor's aggregate interest, not to exceed in value $8,000 1 less any amount of property
of the estate transferred in the manner specified in section 542(d) of this title, in any accrued
dividend or interest under, or loan value of, any unmatured life insurance contract owned by the
debtor under which the insured is the debtor or an individual of whom the debtor is a dependent.

subsection (f) or (h) of this section to avoid a transfer, under subsection (g) or (i) of this section to

extent that the sum of—
(i) the lien;
(ii) all other liens on the property; and
(iii) the amount of the exemption that the debtor could claim if there were no liens on the
property;
exceeds the value that the debtor's interest in the property would have in the absence of any liens.
[Release Point 118-106]
(B) In the case of a property subject to more than 1 lien, a lien that has been avoided shall not be
considered in making the calculation under subparagraph (A) with respect to other liens.

except to the extent that the debtor has permitted the fixing of a consensual lien on any property or
prohibits avoidance of a consensual lien on property otherwise eligible to be claimed as exempt
property;
the debtor may not avoid the fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor or a dependent of the
debtor in property if the lien is a nonpossessory, nonpurchase-money security interest in implements,
professional books, or tools of the trade of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor or farm animals or
crops of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor to the extent the value of such implements,
professional books, tools of the trade, animals, and crops exceeds $5,000.1
(4)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), for purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the term "household goods"

of this section property that the trustee recovers under section 510(c)(2), 542, 543, 550, 551, or 553
of this title, to the extent that the debtor could have exempted such property under subsection (b) of
[Release Point 118-106]
this section if such property had not been transferred, if—
(1)(A) such transfer was not a voluntary transfer of such property by the debtor; and
(B) the debtor did not conceal such property; or
(2) the debtor could have avoided such transfer under subsection (f)(1)(B) of this section.
(h) The debtor may avoid a transfer of property of the debtor or recover a setoff to the extent that
the debtor could have exempted such property under subsection (g)(1) of this section if the trustee
had avoided such transfer, if—
(1) such transfer is avoidable by the trustee under section 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, or 724(a) of
this title or recoverable by the trustee under section 553 of this title; and
(2) the trustee does not attempt to avoid such transfer.
(i)(1) If the debtor avoids a transfer or recovers a setoff under subsection (f) or (h) of this section,
the debtor may recover in the manner prescribed by, and subject to the limitations of, section 550 of
this title, the same as if the trustee had avoided such transfer, and may exempt any property so
recovered under subsection (b) of this section.
(2) Notwithstanding section 551 of this title, a transfer avoided under section 544, 545, 547, 548,
549, or 724(a) of this title, under subsection (f) or (h) of this section, or property recovered under
section 553 of this title, may be preserved for the benefit of the debtor to the extent that the debtor
may exempt such property under subsection (g) of this section or paragraph (1) of this subsection.
(j) Notwithstanding subsections (g) and (i) of this section, the debtor may exempt a particular kind
of property under subsections (g) and (i) of this section only to the extent that the debtor has
exempted less property in value of such kind than that to which the debtor is entitled under
subsection (b) of this section.
(k) Property that the debtor exempts under this section is not liable for payment of any
administrative expense except—
(1) the aliquot share of the costs and expenses of avoiding a transfer of property that the debtor
exempts under subsection (g) of this section, or of recovery of such property, that is attributable to
the value of the portion of such property exempted in relation to the value of the property
recovered; and
(2) any costs and expenses of avoiding a transfer under subsection (f) or (h) of this section, or of
recovery of property under subsection (i)(1) of this section, that the debtor has not paid.
(l) The debtor shall file a list of property that the debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b) of
this section. If the debtor does not file such a list, a dependent of the debtor may file such a list, or
may claim property as exempt from property of the estate on behalf of the debtor. Unless a party in
interest objects, the property claimed as exempt on such list is exempt.
(m) Subject to the limitation in subsection (b), this section shall apply separately with respect to
each debtor in a joint case.
(n) For assets in individual retirement accounts described in section 408 or 408A of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, other than a simplified employee pension under section 408(k) of such Code
or a simple retirement account under section 408(p) of such Code, the aggregate value of such assets
exempted under this section, without regard to amounts attributable to rollover contributions under
section 402(c), 402(e)(6), 403(a)(4), 403(a)(5), and 403(b)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,

except that such amount may be increased if the interests of justice so require.
(o) For purposes of subsection (b)(3)(A), and notwithstanding subsection (a), the value of an
interest in—
(1) real or personal property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as a residence;
(2) a cooperative that owns property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as a
residence;
(3) a burial plot for the debtor or a dependent of the debtor; or
(4) real or personal property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor claims as a homestead;
[Release Point 118-106]
shall be reduced to the extent that such value is attributable to any portion of any property that the
debtor disposed of in the 10-year period ending on the date of the filing of the petition with the intent
to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor and that the debtor could not exempt, or that portion that the
debtor could not exempt, under subsection (b), if on such date the debtor had held the property so
disposed of.
(p)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection and sections 544 and 548, as a result
of electing under subsection (b)(3)(A) to exempt property under State or local law, a debtor may not
exempt any amount of interest that was acquired by the debtor during the 1215-day period preceding
the date of the filing of the petition that exceeds in the aggregate $125,000 1 in value in—
(A) real or personal property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as a residence;
(B) a cooperative that owns property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as a
residence;
(C) a burial plot for the debtor or a dependent of the debtor; or
(D) real or personal property that the debtor or dependent of the debtor claims as a homestead.
(2)(A) The limitation under paragraph (1) shall not apply to an exemption claimed under
subsection (b)(3)(A) by a family farmer for the principal residence of such farmer.
(B) For purposes of paragraph (1), any amount of such interest does not include any interest
transferred from a debtor's previous principal residence (which was acquired prior to the beginning
of such 1215-day period) into the debtor's current principal residence, if the debtor's previous and
current residences are located in the same State.
(q)(1) As a result of electing under subsection (b)(3)(A) to exempt property under State or local
law, a debtor may not exempt any amount of an interest in property described in subparagraphs (A),
(B), (C), and (D) of subsection (p)(1) which exceeds in the aggregate $125,000 1 if—
(A) the court determines, after notice and a hearing, that the debtor has been convicted of a
felony (as defined in section 3156 of title 18), which under the circumstances, demonstrates that
the filing of the case was an abuse of the provisions of this title; or
(B) the debtor owes a debt arising from—
(i) any violation of the Federal securities laws (as defined in section 3(a)(47) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934), any State securities laws, or any regulation or order issued under
Federal securities laws or State securities laws;
(ii) fraud, deceit, or manipulation in a fiduciary capacity or in connection with the purchase
or sale of any security registered under section 12 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of

(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the extent the amount of an interest in property described in
subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of subsection (p)(1) is reasonably necessary for the support of
the debtor and any dependent of the debtor.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 522 of the House amendment represents a compromise on the issue of exemptions between the
[Release Point 118-106]
position taken in the House bill, and that taken in the Senate amendment. Dollar amounts specified in section
522(d) of the House bill have been reduced from amounts as contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House.
The States may, by passing a law, determine whether the Federal exemptions will apply as an alternative to
State exemptions in bankruptcy cases.
Section 522(c)(1) tracks the House bill and provides that dischargeable tax claims may not be collected out
of exempt property.
Section 522(f)(2) is derived from the Senate amendment restricting the debtor to avoidance of
nonpossessory, nonpurchase money security interests.
Exemptions: Section 522(c)(1) of the House amendment adopts a provision contained in the House bill that
dischargeable taxes cannot be collected from exempt assets. This changes present law, which allows collection
of dischargeable taxes from exempt property, a rule followed in the Senate amendment. Nondischargeable
taxes, however, will continue to the [be] collectable out of exempt property. It is anticipated that in the next
session Congress will review the exemptions from levy currently contained in the Internal Revenue Code [title
26] with a view to increasing the exemptions to more realistic levels.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) of this section defines two terms: "dependent" includes the debtor's spouse, whether or not
actually dependent; and "value" means fair market value as of the date of the filing of the petition.
Subsection (b) tracks current law. It permits a debtor the exemptions to which he is entitled under other
Federal law and the law of the State of his domicile. Some of the items that may be exempted under Federal
laws other than title 11 include:
Foreign Service Retirement and Disability payments, 22 U.S.C. 1104; 1
Social security payments, 42 U.S.C. 407;
Injury or death compensation payments from war risk hazards, 42 U.S.C. 1717;
Wages of fishermen, seamen, and apprentices, 46 U.S.C. 601; 2
Civil service retirement benefits, 5 U.S.C. 729, 2265; 3
Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act death and disability benefits, 33 U.S.C. 916;
Railroad Retirement Act annuities and pensions, 45 U.S.C. 228(L); 4
Veterans benefits, 45 U.S.C. 352(E); 5
Special pensions paid to winners of the Congressional Medal of Honor, 38 U.S.C. 3101; 6 and
Federal homestead lands on debts contracted before issuance of the patent, 43 U.S.C. 175.
He may also exempt an interest in property in which the debtor had an interest as a tenant by the entirety or
joint tenant to the extent that interest would have been exempt from process under applicable nonbankruptcy
law.
Under proposed section 541, all property of the debtor becomes property of the estate, but the debtor is
permitted to exempt certain property from property of the estate under this section. Property may be exempted
even if it is subject to a lien, but only the unencumbered portion of the property is to be counted in computing
the "value" of the property for the purposes of exemption.
As under current law, the debtor will be permitted to convert nonexempt property into exempt property
before filing a bankruptcy petition. The practice is not fraudulent as to creditors, and permits the debtor to
make full use of the exemptions to which he is entitled under the law.
Subsection (c) insulates exempt property from prepetition claims other than tax claims (whether or not
dischargeable), and other than alimony, maintenance, or support claims that are excepted from discharge. The
bankruptcy discharge does not prevent enforcement of valid liens. The rule of Long v. Bullard, 117 U.S. 617
(1886), is accepted with respect to the enforcement of valid liens on nonexempt property as well as on exempt
property. Cf. Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, 295 U.S. 555, 583 (1935).
Subsection (c)(3) permits the collection of dischargeable taxes from exempt assets. Only assets exempted
from levy under Section 6334 of the Internal Revenue Code [title 26] or under applicable state or local tax law
cannot be applied to satisfy these tax claims. This rule applies to prepetition tax claims against the debtor
regardless of whether the claims do or do not receive priority and whether they are dischargeable or
nondischargeable. Thus, even if a tax is dischargeable vis-a-vis the debtor's after-acquired assets, it may
nevertheless be collectible from exempt property held by the estate. (Taxes incurred by the debtor's estate
which are collectible as first priority administrative expenses are not collectible from the debtor's estate which
are collectible as first priority administrative expenses are not collectible from the debtor's exempt assets.)
Subsection (d) protects the debtor's exemptions, either Federal or State, by making unenforceable in a
bankruptcy case a waiver of exemptions or a waiver of the debtor's avoiding powers under the following
subsections.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subsection (e) protects the debtor's exemptions, his discharge, and thus his fresh start by permitting him to
avoid certain liens on exempt property. The debtor may avoid a judicial lien on any property to the extent that
the property could have been exempted in the absence of the lien, and may similarly avoid a
nonpurchase-money security interest in certain household and personal goods. The avoiding power is
independent of any waiver of exemptions.
Subsection (f) gives the debtor the ability to exempt property that the trustee recovers under one of the
trustee's avoiding powers if the property was involuntarily transferred away from the debtor (such as by the
fixing of a judicial lien) and if the debtor did not conceal the property. The debtor is also permitted to exempt
property that the trustee recovers as the result of the avoiding of the fixing of certain security interests to the
extent that the debtor could otherwise have exempted the property.
Subsection (g) provides that if the trustee does not exercise an avoiding power to recover a transfer of
property that would be exempt, the debtor may exercise it and exempt the property, if the transfer was
involuntary and the debtor did not conceal the property. If the debtor wishes to preserve his right to pursue any
action under this provision, then he must intervene in any action brought by the trustee based on the same
cause of action. It is not intended that the debtor be given an additional opportunity to avoid a transfer or that
the transferee should have to defend the same action twice. Rather, the section is primarily designed to give
the debtor the rights the trustee could have, but has not, pursued. The debtor is given no greater rights under
this provision than the trustee, and thus, the debtor's avoiding powers under proposed sections 544, 545, 547,
and 548, are subject to proposed 546, as are the trustee's powers.
These subsections are cumulative. The debtor is not required to choose which he will use to gain an
exemption. Instead, he may use more than one in any particular instance, just as the trustee's avoiding powers
are cumulative.
Subsection (h) permits recovery by the debtor of property transferred by an avoided transfer from either the
initial or subsequent transferees. It also permits preserving a transfer for the benefit of the debtor. In either
event, the debtor may exempt the property recovered or preserved.
Subsection (i) makes clear that the debtor may exempt property under the avoiding subsections (f) and (h)
only to the extent he has exempted less property than allowed under subsection (b).
Subsection (j) makes clear that the liability of the debtor's exempt property is limited to the debtor's aliquot
share of the costs and expenses recovery of property that the trustee recovers and the debtor later exempts, and
any costs and expenses of avoiding a transfer by the debtor that the debtor has not already paid.
Subsection (k) requires the debtor to file a list of property that he claims as exempt from property of the
estate. Absent an objection to the list, the property is exempted. A dependent of the debtor may file it and thus
be protected if the debtor fails to file the list.
Subsection (l) provides the rule for a joint case.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (a) of this section defines two terms: "dependent" includes the debtor's spouse, whether or not
actually dependent; and "value" means fair market value as of the date of the filing of the petition.
Subsection (b), the operative subsection of this section, is a significant departure from present law. It
permits an individual debtor in a bankruptcy case a choice between exemption systems. The debtor may
choose the Federal exemptions prescribed in subsection (d), or he may choose the exemptions to which he is
entitled under other Federal law and the law of the State of his domicile. If the debtor chooses the latter, some
of the items that may be exempted under other Federal laws include:
—Foreign Service Retirement and Disability payments, 22 U.S.C. 1104; 7
—Social security payments, 42 U.S.C. 407;
—Injury or death compensation payments from war risk hazards, 42 U.S.C. 1717;
—Wages of fishermen, seamen, and apprentices, 46 U.S.C. 601; 8
—Civil service retirement benefits, 5 U.S.C. 729, 2265; 9
—Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act death and disability benefits, 33
U.S.C. 916;
—Railroad Retirement Act annuities and pensions, 45 U.S.C. 228(l); 10
—Veterans benefits, 45 U.S.C. 352(E); 11
—Special pensions paid to winners of the Congressional Medal of Honor, 38 U.S.C. 3101; 12 and
—Federal homestead lands on debts contracted before issuance of the patent, 43 U.S.C. 175.
He may also exempt an interest in property in which the debtor had an interest as a tenant by the entirety or
joint tenant to the extent that interest would have been exempt from process under applicable nonbankruptcy
[Release Point 118-106]
law. The Rules will provide for the situation where the debtor's choice of exemption, Federal or State, was
improvident and should be changed, for example, where the court has ruled against the debtor with respect to
a major exemption.
Under proposed 11 U.S.C. 541, all property of the debtor becomes property of the estate, but the debtor is
permitted to exempt certain property from property of the estate under this section. Property may be exempted
even if it is subject to a lien, but only the unencumbered portion of the property is to be counted in computing
the "value" of the property for the purposes of exemption. Thus, for example, a residence worth $30,000 with
a mortgage of $25,000 will be exemptable [sic] to the extent of $5,000. This follows current law. The
remaining value of the property will be dealt with in the bankruptcy case as is any interest in property that is
subject to a lien.
As under current law, the debtor will be permitted to convert nonexempt property into exempt property
before filing a bankruptcy petition. See Hearings, pt. 3, at 1355–58. The practice is not fraudulent as to
creditors and permits the debtor to make full use of the exemptions to which he is entitled under the law.
Subsection (c) insulates exempt property from prepetition claims, except tax and alimony, maintenance, or
support claims that are excepted from discharge. The bankruptcy discharge will not prevent enforcement of
valid liens. The rule of Long v. Bullard, 117 U.S. 617 (1886) [6 S.Ct. 917, 29 L.Ed. 1004], is accepted with
respect to the enforcement of valid liens on nonexempt property as well as on exempt property. Cf. Louisville
Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, 295 U.S. 555, 583 (1935) [55 S.Ct. 854].
Subsection (d) specifies the Federal exemptions to which the debtor is entitled. They are derived in large
part from the Uniform Exemptions Act, promulgated by the Commissioners of Uniform State Laws in August,
1976. Eleven categories of property are exempted. First is a homestead to the extent of $10,000, which may be
claimed in real or personal property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as a residence. Second,
the debtor may exempt a motor vehicle to the extent of $1500. Third, the debtor may exempt household
goods, furnishings, clothing, and similar household items, held primarily for the personal, family, or
household use of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor. "Animals" includes all animals, such as pets,
livestock, poultry, and fish, if they are held primarily for personal, family or household use. The limitation for
third category items is $300 on any particular item. The debtor may also exempt up to $750 of personal
jewelry.
Paragraph (5) permits the exemption of $500, plus any unused amount of the homestead exemption, in any
property, in order not to discriminate against the nonhomeowner. Paragraph (6) grants the debtor up to $1000
in implements, professional books, or tools, of the trade of the debtor or a dependent. Paragraph (7) exempts a
life insurance contract, other than a credit life insurance contract, owned by the debtor. This paragraph refers
to the life insurance contract itself. It does not encompass any other rights under the contract, such as the right
to borrow out the loan value. Because of this provision, the trustee may not surrender a life insurance contract,
which remains property of the debtor if he chooses the Federal exemptions. Paragraph (8) permits the debtor
to exempt up to $5000 in loan value in a life insurance policy owned by the debtor under which the debtor or
an individual of whom the debtor is a dependent is the insured. The exemption provided by this paragraph and
paragraph (7) will also include the debtor's rights in a group insurance certificate under which the insured is an
individual of whom the debtor is a dependent (assuming the debtor has rights in the policy that could be
exempted) or the debtor. A trustee is authorized to collect the entire loan value on every life insurance policy
owned by the debtor as property of the estate. First, however, the debtor will choose which policy or policies
under which the loan value will be exempted. The $5000 figure is reduced by the amount of any automatic
premium loan authorized after the date of the filing of the petition under section 542(d). Paragraph (9)
exempts professionally prescribed health aids.
Paragraph (10) exempts certain benefits that are akin to future earnings of the debtor. These include social
security, unemployment compensation, or public assistance benefits, veteran's benefits, disability, illness, or
unemployment benefits, alimony, support, or separate maintenance (but only to the extent reasonably
necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependents of the debtor), and benefits under a certain stock
bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity or similar plan based on illness, disability, death, age or length of
service. Paragraph (11) allows the debtor to exempt certain compensation for losses. These include crime
victim's reparation benefits, wrongful death benefits (with a reasonably necessary for support limitation), life
insurance proceeds (same limitation), compensation for bodily injury, not including pain and suffering
($10,000 limitation), and loss of future earnings payments (support limitation). This provision in subparagraph
(D)(11) is designed to cover payments in compensation of actual bodily injury, such as the loss of a limb, and
is not intended to include the attendant costs that accompany such a loss, such as medical payments, pain and
suffering, or loss of earnings. Those items are handled separately by the bill.
Subsection (e) protects the debtor's exemptions, either Federal or State, by making unenforceable in a
bankruptcy case a waiver of exemptions or a waiver of the debtor's avoiding powers under the following
[Release Point 118-106]
subsections.
Subsection (f) protects the debtor's exemptions, his discharge, and thus his fresh start by permitting him to
avoid certain liens on exempt property. The debtor may avoid a judicial lien on any property to the extent that
the property could have been exempted in the absence of the lien, and may similarly avoid a
nonpurchase-money security interest in certain household and personal goods. The avoiding power is
independent of any waiver of exemptions.
Subsection (g) gives the debtor the ability to exempt property that the trustee recovers under one of the
trustee's avoiding powers if the property was involuntarily transferred away from the debtor (such as by the
fixing of a judicial lien) and if the debtor did not conceal the property. The debtor is also permitted to exempt
property that the trustee recovers as the result of the avoiding of the fixing of certain security interests to the
extent that the debtor could otherwise have exempted the property.
If the trustee does not pursue an avoiding power to recover a transfer of property that would be exempt, the
debtor may pursue it and exempt the property, if the transfer was involuntary and the debtor did not conceal
the property. If the debtor wishes to preserve his right to pursue an action under this provision, then he must
intervene in any action brought by the trustee based on the same cause of action. It is not intended that the
debtor be given an additional opportunity to avoid a transfer or that the transferee have to defend the same
action twice. Rather, the section is primarily designed to give the debtor the rights the trustee could have
pursued if the trustee chooses not to pursue them. The debtor is given no greater rights under this provision
than the trustee, and thus the debtor's avoiding powers under proposed 11 U.S.C. 544, 545, 547, and 548, are
subject to proposed 11 U.S.C. 546, as are the trustee's powers.
These subsections are cumulative. The debtor is not required to choose which he will use to gain an
exemption. Instead, he may use more than one in any particular instance, just as the trustee's avoiding powers
are cumulative.
Subsection (i) permits recovery by the debtor of property transferred in an avoided transfer from either the
initial or subsequent transferees. It also permits preserving a transfer for the benefit of the debtor. Under either
case the debtor may exempt the property recovered or preserved.
Subsection (k) makes clear that the debtor's aliquot share of the costs and expenses [for] recovery of
property that the trustee recovers and the debtor later exempts, and any costs and expenses of avoiding a
transfer by the debtor that the debtor has not already paid.
Subsection (l) requires the debtor to file a list of property that he claims as exempt from property of the
estate. Absent an objection to the list, the property is exempted. A dependent of the debtor may file it and thus
be protected if the debtor fails to file the list.
Subsection (m) requires the clerk of the bankruptcy court to give notice of any exemptions claimed under
subsection (l), in order that parties in interest may have an opportunity to object to the claim.
Subsection (n) provides the rule for a joint case: each debtor is entitled to the Federal exemptions provided
under this section or to the State exemptions, whichever the debtor chooses.

(II) cash advances aggregating more than $750 2 that are extensions of consumer credit
under an open end credit plan obtained by an individual debtor on or within 70 days before

(I) the terms "consumer", "credit", and "open end credit plan" have the same meanings as

(17) for a fee imposed on a prisoner by any court for the filing of a case, motion, complaint, or

similar non-Federal law), or the debtor's status as a prisoner, as defined in section 1915(h) of title
28 (or a similar non-Federal law);
(18) owed to a pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or other plan established under section 401,
403, 408, 408A, 414, 457, or 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, under—
(A) a loan permitted under section 408(b)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, or subject to section 72(p) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or
(B) a loan from a thrift savings plan permitted under subchapter III of chapter 84 of title 5,
that satisfies the requirements of section 8433(g) of such title;
but nothing in this paragraph may be construed to provide that any loan made under a
governmental plan under section 414(d), or a contract or account under section 403(b), of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 constitutes a claim or a debt under this title;
(19) that—
(A) is for—
(i) the violation of any of the Federal securities laws (as that term is defined in section
3(a)(47) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), any of the State securities laws, or any
regulation or order issued under such Federal or State securities laws; or
(ii) common law fraud, deceit, or manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of
any security; and
(B) results, before, on, or after the date on which the petition was filed, from—
(i) any judgment, order, consent order, or decree entered in any Federal or State judicial or
administrative proceeding;
(ii) any settlement agreement entered into by the debtor; or
(iii) any court or administrative order for any damages, fine, penalty, citation,
restitutionary payment, disgorgement payment, attorney fee, cost, or other payment owed by
the debtor; or
(20) for injury to an individual by the debtor relating to a violation of chapter 77 of title 18,
including injury caused by an instance in which the debtor knowingly benefitted financially, or by
receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture that the debtor knew or should have
known engaged in an act in violation of chapter 77 of title 18.
For purposes of this subsection, the term "return" means a return that satisfies the requirements of
applicable nonbankruptcy law (including applicable filing requirements). Such term includes a return
prepared pursuant to section 6020(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or similar State or local
law, or a written stipulation to a judgment or a final order entered by a nonbankruptcy tribunal, but
does not include a return made pursuant to section 6020(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or
a similar State or local law.
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a debt that was excepted from discharge under
subsection (a)(1), (a)(3), or (a)(8) of this section, under section 17a(1), 17a(3), or 17a(5) of the
Bankruptcy Act, under section 439A 3 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, or under section 733(g)
3 of the Public Health Service Act in a prior case concerning the debtor under this title, or under the
Bankruptcy Act, is dischargeable in a case under this title unless, by the terms of subsection (a) of
this section, such debt is not dischargeable in the case under this title.
(c)(1) Except as provided in subsection (a)(3)(B) of this section, the debtor shall be discharged
from a debt of a kind specified in paragraph (2), (4), or (6) of subsection (a) of this section, unless,
on request of the creditor to whom such debt is owed, and after notice and a hearing, the court
determines such debt to be excepted from discharge under paragraph (2), (4), or (6), as the case may
be, of subsection (a) of this section.
(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of a Federal depository institutions regulatory agency
[Release Point 118-106]
seeking, in its capacity as conservator, receiver, or liquidating agent for an insured depository
institution, to recover a debt described in subsection (a)(2), (a)(4), (a)(6), or (a)(11) owed to such
institution by an institution-affiliated party unless the receiver, conservator, or liquidating agent was
appointed in time to reasonably comply, or for a Federal depository institutions regulatory agency
acting in its corporate capacity as a successor to such receiver, conservator, or liquidating agent to
reasonably comply, with subsection (a)(3)(B) as a creditor of such institution-affiliated party with
respect to such debt.
(d) If a creditor requests a determination of dischargeability of a consumer debt under subsection
(a)(2) of this section, and such debt is discharged, the court shall grant judgment in favor of the
debtor for the costs of, and a reasonable attorney's fee for, the proceeding if the court finds that the
position of the creditor was not substantially justified, except that the court shall not award such
costs and fees if special circumstances would make the award unjust.
(e) Any institution-affiliated party of an insured depository institution shall be considered to be
acting in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the purposes of subsection (a)(4) or (11).

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 523(a)(1) represents a compromise between the position taken in the House bill and the Senate
amendment. Section 523(a)(2) likewise represents a compromise between the position taken in the House bill
and the Senate amendment with respect to the false financial statement exception to discharge. In order to
clarify that a "renewal of credit" includes a "refinancing of credit", explicit reference to a refinancing of credit
is made in the preamble to section 523(a)(2). A renewal of credit or refinancing of credit that was obtained by
a false financial statement within the terms of section 523(a)(2) is nondischargeable. However, each of the
provisions of section 523(a)(2) must be proved. Thus, under section 523(a)(2)(A) a creditor must prove that
the debt was obtained by false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement
respecting the debtor's or an insider's financial condition. Subparagraph (A) is intended to codify current case
law e.g., Neal v. Clark, 95 U.S. 704 (1887) [24 L. Ed. 586], which interprets "fraud" to mean actual or positive
fraud rather than fraud implied in law. Subparagraph (A) is mutually exclusive from subparagraph (B).
Subparagraph (B) pertains to the so-called false financial statement. In order for the debt to be
nondischargeable, the creditor must prove that the debt was obtained by the use of a statement in writing (i)
that is materially false; (ii) respecting the debtor's or an insider's financial condition; (iii) on which the creditor
to whom the debtor is liable for obtaining money, property, services, or credit reasonably relied; (iv) that the
debtor caused to be made or published with intent to deceive. Section 523(a)(2)(B)(iv) is not intended to
change from present law since the statement that the debtor causes to be made or published with the intent to
deceive automatically includes a statement that the debtor actually makes or publishes with an intent to
deceive. Section 523(a)(2)(B) is explained in the House report. Under section 523(a)(2)(B)(i) a discharge is
barred only as to that portion of a loan with respect to which a false financial statement is materially false.
In many cases, a creditor is required by state law to refinance existing credit on which there has been no
default. If the creditor does not forfeit remedies or otherwise rely to his detriment on a false financial
[Release Point 118-106]
statement with respect to existing credit, then an extension, renewal, or refinancing of such credit is
nondischargeable only to the extent of the new money advanced; on the other hand, if an existing loan is in
default or the creditor otherwise reasonably relies to his detriment on a false financial statement with regard to
an existing loan, then the entire debt is nondischargeable under section 523(a)(2)(B). This codifies the
reasoning expressed by the second circuit in In re Danns, 558 F.2d 114 (2d Cir. 1977).
Section 523(a)(3) of the House amendment is derived from the Senate amendment. The provision is
intended to overrule Birkett v. Columbia Bank, 195 U.S. 345 (1904) [25 S.Ct. 38, 49 L.Ed. 231, 12
Am.Bankr.Rep. 691].
Section 523(a)(4) of the House amendment represents a compromise between the House bill and the Senate
amendment.
Section 523(a)(5) is a compromise between the House bill and the Senate amendment. The provision
excepts from discharge a debt owed to a spouse, former spouse or child of the debtor, in connection with a
separation agreement, divorce decree, or property settlement agreement, for alimony to, maintenance for, or
support of such spouse or child but not to the extent that the debt is assigned to another entity. If the debtor
has assumed an obligation of the debtor's spouse to a third party in connection with a separation agreement,
property settlement agreement, or divorce proceeding, such debt is dischargeable to the extent that payment of
the debt by the debtor is not actually in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support of debtor's spouse,
former spouse, or child.
Section 523(a)(6) adopts the position taken in the House bill and rejects the alternative suggested in the
Senate amendment. The phrase "willful and malicious injury" covers a willful and malicious conversion.
Section 523(a)(7) of the House amendment adopts the position taken in the Senate amendment and rejects
the position taken in the House bill. A penalty relating to a tax cannot be nondischargeable unless the tax itself
is nondischargeable.
Section 523(a)(8) represents a compromise between the House bill and the Senate amendment regarding
educational loans. This provision is broader than current law which is limited to federally insured loans. Only
educational loans owing to a governmental unit or a nonprofit institution of higher education are made
nondischargeable under this paragraph.
Section 523(b) is new. The section represents a modification of similar provisions contained in the House
bill and the Senate amendment.
Section 523(c) of the House amendment adopts the position taken in the Senate amendment.
Section 523(d) represents a compromise between the position taken in the House bill and the Senate
amendment on the issue of attorneys' fees in false financial statement complaints to determine
dischargeability. The provision contained in the House bill permitting the court to award damages is
eliminated. The court must grant the debtor judgment or a reasonable attorneys' fee unless the granting of
judgment would be clearly inequitable.
Nondischargeable debts: The House amendment retains the basic categories of nondischargeable tax
liabilities contained in both bills, but restricts the time limits on certain nondischargeable taxes. Under the
amendment, nondischargeable taxes cover taxes entitled to priority under section 507(a)(6) of title 11 and, in
the case of individual debtors under chapters 7, 11, or 13, tax liabilities with respect to which no required
return had been filed or as to which a late return had been filed if the return became last due, including
extensions, within 2 years before the date of the petition or became due after the petition or as to which the
debtor made a fraudulent return, entry or invoice or fraudulently attempted to evade or defeat the tax.
In the case of individuals in liquidation under chapter 7 or in reorganization under chapter 11 of title 11,
section 1141(d)(2) incorporates by reference the exceptions to discharge continued in section 523. Different
rules concerning the discharge of taxes where a partnership or corporation reorganizes under chapter 11, apply
under section 1141.
The House amendment also deletes the reduction rule contained in section 523(e) of the Senate amendment.
Under that rule, the amount of an otherwise nondischargeable tax liability would be reduced by the amount
which a governmental tax authority could have collected from the debtor's estate if it had filed a timely claim
against the estate but which it did not collect because no such claim was filed. This provision is deleted in
order not to effectively compel a tax authority to file claim against the estate in "no asset" cases, along with a
dischargeability petition. In no-asset cases, therefore, if the tax authority is not potentially penalized by failing
to file a claim, the debtor in such cases will have a better opportunity to choose the prepayment forum,
bankruptcy court or the Tax Court, in which to litigate his personal liability for a nondischargeable tax.
The House amendment also adopts the Senate amendment provision limiting the nondischargeability of
punitive tax penalties, that is, penalties other than those which represent collection of a principal amount of
tax liability through the form of a "penalty." Under the House amendment, tax penalties which are basically
punitive in nature are to be nondischargeable only if the penalty is computed by reference to a related tax
[Release Point 118-106]
liability which is nondischargeable or, if the amount of the penalty is not computed by reference to a tax
liability, the transaction or event giving rise to the penalty occurred during the 3-year period ending on the
date of the petition.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section specifies which of the debtor's debts are not discharged in a bankruptcy case, and certain
procedures for effectuating the section. The provision in Bankruptcy Act §17c [section 35(c) of former title
11] granting the bankruptcy courts jurisdiction to determine dischargeability is deleted as unnecessary, in view
of the comprehensive grant of jurisdiction prescribed in proposed 28 U.S.C. 1334(b), which is adequate to
cover the full jurisdiction that the bankruptcy courts have today over dischargeability and related issues under
Bankruptcy Act §17c. The Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure will specify, as they do today, who may request
determinations of dischargeability, subject, of course, to proposed 11 U.S.C. 523(c), and when such a request
may be made. Proposed 11 U.S.C. 350, providing for reopening of cases, provides one possible procedure for
a determination of dischargeability and related issues after a case is closed.
Subsection (a) lists nine kinds of debts excepted from discharge. Taxes that are excepted from discharge are
set forth in paragraph (1). These include claims against the debtor which receive priority in the second, third
and sixth categories (§507(a)(3)(B) and (c) and (6)). These categories include taxes for which the tax authority
failed to file a claim against the estate or filed its claim late. Whether or not the taxing authority's claim is
secured will also not affect the claim's nondischargeability if the tax liability in question is otherwise entitled
to priority.
Also included in the nondischargeable debts are taxes for which the debtor had not filed a required return as
of the petition date, or for which a return had been filed beyond its last permitted due date (§523(a)(1)(B)).
For this purpose, the date of the tax year to which the return relates is immaterial. The late return rule applies,
however, only to the late returns filed within three years before the petition was filed, and to late returns filed
after the petition in title 11 was filed. For this purpose, the taxable year in question need not be one or more of
the three years immediately preceding the filing of the petition.
Tax claims with respect to which the debtor filed a fraudulent return, entry or invoice, or fraudulently
attempted to evade or defeat any tax (§523(a)(1)(C)) are included. The date of the taxable year with regard to
which the fraud occurred is immaterial.
Also included are tax payments due under an agreement for deferred payment of taxes, which a debtor had
entered into with the Internal Revenue Service (or State or local tax authority) before the filing of the petition
and which relate to a prepetition tax liability (§523(a)(1)(D)) are also nondischargeable. This classification
applies only to tax claims which would have received priority under section 507(a) if the taxpayer had filed a
title 11 petition on the date on which the deferred payment agreement was entered into. This rule also applies
only to installment payments which become due during and after the commencement of the title 11 case.
Payments which had become due within one year before the filing of the petition receive sixth priority, and
will be nondischargeable under the general rule of section 523(a)(1)(A).
The above categories of nondischargeability apply to customs duties as well as to taxes.
Paragraph (2) provides that as under Bankruptcy Act §17a(2) [section 35(a)(2) of former title 11], a debt for
obtaining money, property, services, or a refinancing extension or renewal of credit by false pretenses, a false
representation, or actual fraud, or by use of a statement in writing respecting the debtor's financial condition
that is materially false, on which the creditor reasonably relied, and which the debtor made or published with
intent to deceive, is excepted from discharge. This provision is modified only slightly from current section
17a(2). First, "actual fraud" is added as a ground for exception from discharge. Second, the creditor must not
only have relied on a false statement in writing, but the reliance must have been reasonable. This codifies case
law construing present section 17a(2). Third, the phrase "in any manner whatsoever" that appears in current
law after "made or published" is deleted as unnecessary, the word "published" is used in the same sense that it
is used in defamation cases.
Unscheduled debts are excepted from discharge under paragraph (3). The provision, derived from section
17a(3) [section 35(a)(3) of former title 11], follows current law, but clarifies some uncertainties generated by
the case law construing 17a(3). The debt is excepted from discharge if it was not scheduled in time to permit
timely action by the creditor to protect his rights, unless the creditor had notice or actual knowledge of the
case.
Paragraph (4) excepts debts for fraud incurred by the debtor while acting in a fiduciary capacity or for
defalcation, embezzlement, or misappropriation.
Paragraph (5) provides that debts for willful and malicious conversion or injury by the debtor to another
entity or the property of another entity are nondischargeable. Under this paragraph "willful" means deliberate
or intentional. To the extent that Tinker v. Colwell, 139 U.S. 473 (1902), held that a less strict standard is
[Release Point 118-106]
intended, and to the extent that other cases have relied on Tinker to apply a "reckless disregard" standard, they
are overruled.
Paragraph (6) excepts from discharge debts to a spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor for alimony
to, maintenance for, or support of the spouse or child. This language, in combination with the repeal of section
456(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 656(b)) by section 326 of the bill, will apply to make
nondischargeable only alimony, maintenance, or support owed directly to a spouse or dependent. What
constitutes alimony, maintenance, or support, will be determined under the bankruptcy law, not State law.
Thus, cases such as In re Waller, 494 F.2d 447 (6th Cir. 1974), are overruled, and the result in cases such as
Fife v. Fife, 1 Utah 2d 281, 265 P.2d 642 (1952) is followed. The proviso, however, makes nondischargeable
any debts resulting from an agreement by the debtor to hold the debtor's spouse harmless on joint debts, to the
extent that the agreement is in payment of alimony, maintenance, or support of the spouse, as determined
under bankruptcy law considerations as to whether a particular agreement to pay money to a spouse is actually
alimony or a property settlement.
Paragraph (7) makes nondischargeable certain liabilities for penalties including tax penalties if the
underlying tax with respect to which the penalty was imposed is also nondischargeable (sec. 523(a)(7)). These
latter liabilities cover those which, but are penal in nature, as distinct from so-called "pecuniary loss" penalties
which, in the case of taxes, involve basically the collection of a tax under the label of a "penalty." This
provision differs from the bill as introduced, which did not link the nondischarge of a tax penalty with the
treatment of the underlying tax. The amended provision reflects the existing position of the Internal Revenue
Service as to tax penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue Code (Rev.Rul. 68–574, 1968–2 C.B. 595).
Paragraph (8) follows generally current law and excerpts from discharge student loans until such loans have
been due and owing for five years. Such loans include direct student loans as well as insured and guaranteed
loans. This provision is intended to be self-executing and the lender or institution is not required to file a
complaint to determine the nondischargeability of any student loan.
Paragraph (9) excepts from discharge debts that the debtor owed before a previous bankruptcy case
concerning the debtor in which the debtor was denied a discharge other than on the basis of the six-year bar.
Subsection (b) of this section permits discharge in a bankruptcy case of an unscheduled debt from a prior
case. This provision is carried over from Bankruptcy Act §17b [section 35(b) of former title 11]. The result
dictated by the subsection would probably not be different if the subsection were not included. It is included
nevertheless for clarity.
Subsection (c) requires a creditor who is owed a debt that may be excepted from discharge under paragraph
(2), (4), or (5), (false statements, defalcation or larceny misappropriation, or willful and malicious injury) to
initiate proceedings in the bankruptcy court for an exception to discharge. If the creditor does not act, the debt
is discharged. This provision does not change current law.
Subsection (d) is new. It provides protection to a consumer debtor that dealt honestly with a creditor who
sought to have a debt excepted from discharge on the ground of falsity in the incurring of the debt. The debtor
may be awarded costs and a reasonable attorney's fee for the proceeding to determine the dischargeability of a
debt under subsection (a)(2), if the court finds that the proceeding was frivolous or not brought by its creditor
in good faith.
The purpose of the provision is to discourage creditors from initiating proceedings to obtaining a false
financial statement exception to discharge in the hope of obtaining a settlement from an honest debtor anxious
to save attorney's fees. Such practices impair the debtor's fresh start and are contrary to the spirit of the
bankruptcy laws.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (a) lists eight kinds of debts excepted from discharge. Taxes that are entitled to priority are
excepted from discharge under paragraph (1). In addition, taxes with respect to which the debtor made a
fraudulent return or willfully attempted to evade or defeat, or with respect to which a return (if required) was
not filed or was not filed after the due date and after one year before the bankruptcy case are excepted from
discharge. If the taxing authority's claim has been disallowed, then it would be barred by the more modern
rules of collateral estoppel from reasserting that claim against the debtor after the case was closed. See Plumb,
The Tax Recommendations of the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws: Tax Procedures, 88 Harv.L.Rev.
1360, 1388 (1975).
As under Bankruptcy Act §17a(2) [section 35(a)(2) of former title 11], debt for obtaining money, property,
services, or an extension or renewal of credit by false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, or by
use of a statement in writing respecting the debtor's financial condition that is materially false, on which the
creditor reasonably relied, and that the debtor made or published with intent to deceive, is excepted from
discharge. This provision is modified only slightly from current section 17a(2). First, "actual fraud" is added
[Release Point 118-106]
as a grounds for exception from discharge. Second, the creditor must not only have relied on a false statement
in writing, the reliance must have been reasonable. This codifies case law construing this provision. Third, the
phrase "in any manner whatsoever" that appears in current law after "made or published" is deleted as
unnecessary. The word "published" is used in the same sense that it is used in slander actions.
Unscheduled debts are excepted from discharge under paragraph (3). The provision, derived from section
17a(3) [section 35(a)(3) of former title 11], follows current law, but clarifies some uncertainties generated by
the case law construing 17a(3). The debt is excepted from discharge if it was not scheduled in time to permit
timely action by the creditor to protect his rights, unless the creditor had notice or actual knowledge of the
case.
Paragraph (4) excepts debts for embezzlement or larceny. The deletion of willful and malicious conversion
from §17a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act [section 35(a)(2) of former title 11] is not intended to effect a substantive
change. The intent is to include in the category of non-dischargeable debts a conversion under which the
debtor willfully and maliciously intends to borrow property for a short period of time with no intent to inflict
injury but on which injury is in fact inflicted.
Paragraph (5) excepts from discharge debts to a spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor for alimony
to, maintenance for, or support of, the spouse or child. This language, in combination with the repeal of
section 456(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 656(b)) by section 327 of the bill, will apply to make
nondischargeable only alimony, maintenance, or support owed directly to a spouse or dependent. See
Hearings, pt. 2, at 942. What constitutes alimony, maintenance, or support, will be determined under the
bankruptcy laws, not State law. Thus, cases such as In re Waller, 494 F.2d 447 (6th Cir. 1974); Hearings, pt.
3, at 1308–10, are overruled, and the result in cases such as Fife v. Fife, 1 Utah 2d 281, 265 P.2d 642 (1952) is
followed. This provision will, however, make nondischargeable any debts resulting from an agreement by the
debtor to hold the debtor's spouse harmless on joint debts, to the extent that the agreement is in payment of
alimony, maintenance, or support of the spouse, as determined under bankruptcy law considerations that are
similar to considerations of whether a particular agreement to pay money to a spouse is actually alimony or a
property settlement. See Hearings, pt. 3, at 1287–1290.
Paragraph (6) excepts debts for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another person or to the
property of another person. Under this paragraph, "willful" means deliberate or intentional. To the extent that
Tinker v. Colwell, 193 U.S. 473 (1902) [24 S.Ct. 505, 48 L.Ed. 754, 11 Am.Bankr.Rep. 568], held that a
looser standard is intended, and to the extent that other cases have relied on Tinker to apply a "reckless
disregard" standard, they are overruled.
Paragraph (7) excepts from discharge a debt for a fine, penalty, or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit
of a governmental unit, that is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.
Paragraph (8) [enacted as (9)] excepts from discharge debts that the debtor owed before a previous
bankruptcy case concerning the debtor in which the debtor was denied a discharge other than on the basis of
the six-year bar.
Subsection (d) is new. It provides protection to a consumer debtor that dealt honestly with a creditor who
sought to have a debt excepted from discharge on grounds of falsity in the incurring of the debt. The debtor is
entitled to costs of and a reasonable attorney's fee for the proceeding to determine the dischargeability of a
debt under subsection (a)(2), if the creditor initiated the proceeding and the debt was determined to be
dischargeable. The court is permitted to award any actual pecuniary loss that the debtor may have suffered as
a result of the proceeding (such as loss of a day's pay). The purpose of the provision is to discourage creditors
from initiating false financial statement exception to discharge actions in the hopes of obtaining a settlement
from an honest debtor anxious to save attorney's fees. Such practices impair the debtor's fresh start.

§524. Effect of discharge
(a) A discharge in a case under this title—
(1) voids any judgment at any time obtained, to the extent that such judgment is a determination
of the personal liability of the debtor with respect to any debt discharged under section 727, 944,
1141, 1192, 1228, or 1328 of this title, whether or not discharge of such debt is waived;
(2) operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action, the
employment of process, or an act, to collect, recover or offset any such debt as a personal liability
of the debtor, whether or not discharge of such debt is waived; and
(3) operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action, the
employment of process, or an act, to collect or recover from, or offset against, property of the
debtor of the kind specified in section 541(a)(2) of this title that is acquired after the
commencement of the case, on account of any allowable community claim, except a community
claim that is excepted from discharge under section 523, 1192, 1228(a)(1), or 1328(a)(1), or that
would be so excepted, determined in accordance with the provisions of sections 523(c) and 523(d)
of this title, in a case concerning the debtor's spouse commenced on the date of the filing of the
petition in the case concerning the debtor, whether or not discharge of the debt based on such
community claim is waived.
(b) Subsection (a)(3) of this section does not apply if—
[Release Point 118-106]
(1)(A) the debtor's spouse is a debtor in a case under this title, or a bankrupt or a debtor in a
case under the Bankruptcy Act, commenced within six years of the date of the filing of the petition
in the case concerning the debtor; and
(B) the court does not grant the debtor's spouse a discharge in such case concerning the debtor's
spouse; or
(2)(A) the court would not grant the debtor's spouse a discharge in a case under chapter 7 of this
title concerning such spouse commenced on the date of the filing of the petition in the case
concerning the debtor; and
(B) a determination that the court would not so grant such discharge is made by the bankruptcy
court within the time and in the manner provided for a determination under section 727 of this title
of whether a debtor is granted a discharge.
(c) An agreement between a holder of a claim and the debtor, the consideration for which, in
whole or in part, is based on a debt that is dischargeable in a case under this title is enforceable only
to any extent enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law, whether or not discharge of such debt
is waived, only if—
(1) such agreement was made before the granting of the discharge under section 727, 1141,
1192, 1228, or 1328 of this title;
(2) the debtor received the disclosures described in subsection (k) at or before the time at which
the debtor signed the agreement;
(3) such agreement has been filed with the court and, if applicable, accompanied by a
declaration or an affidavit of the attorney that represented the debtor during the course of
negotiating an agreement under this subsection, which states that—
(A) such agreement represents a fully informed and voluntary agreement by the debtor;
(B) such agreement does not impose an undue hardship on the debtor or a dependent of the
debtor; and
(C) the attorney fully advised the debtor of the legal effect and consequences of—
(i) an agreement of the kind specified in this subsection; and
(ii) any default under such an agreement;
(4) the debtor has not rescinded such agreement at any time prior to discharge or within sixty
days after such agreement is filed with the court, whichever occurs later, by giving notice of
rescission to the holder of such claim;
(5) the provisions of subsection (d) of this section have been complied with; and
(6)(A) in a case concerning an individual who was not represented by an attorney during the
course of negotiating an agreement under this subsection, the court approves such agreement as—
(i) not imposing an undue hardship on the debtor or a dependent of the debtor; and
(ii) in the best interest of the debtor.
(B) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the extent that such debt is a consumer debt secured by
real property.
(d) In a case concerning an individual, when the court has determined whether to grant or not to
grant a discharge under section 727, 1141, 1192, 1228, or 1328 of this title, the court may hold a
hearing at which the debtor shall appear in person. At any such hearing, the court shall inform the
debtor that a discharge has been granted or the reason why a discharge has not been granted. If a
discharge has been granted and if the debtor desires to make an agreement of the kind specified in
subsection (c) of this section and was not represented by an attorney during the course of negotiating
such agreement, then the court shall hold a hearing at which the debtor shall appear in person and at
such hearing the court shall—
(1) inform the debtor—
(A) that such an agreement is not required under this title, under nonbankruptcy law, or under
any agreement not made in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section; and

(B) of the legal effect and consequences of—
(i) an agreement of the kind specified in subsection (c) of this section; and
(ii) a default under such an agreement; and
(2) determine whether the agreement that the debtor desires to make complies with the
requirements of subsection (c)(6) of this section, if the consideration for such agreement is based
in whole or in part on a consumer debt that is not secured by real property of the debtor.
(e) Except as provided in subsection (a)(3) of this section, discharge of a debt of the debtor does
not affect the liability of any other entity on, or the property of any other entity for, such debt.
(f) Nothing contained in subsection (c) or (d) of this section prevents a debtor from voluntarily
repaying any debt.
(g)(1)(A) After notice and hearing, a court that enters an order confirming a plan of reorganization
under chapter 11 may issue, in connection with such order, an injunction in accordance with this
subsection to supplement the injunctive effect of a discharge under this section.
(B) An injunction may be issued under subparagraph (A) to enjoin entities from taking legal action
for the purpose of directly or indirectly collecting, recovering, or receiving payment or recovery with
respect to any claim or demand that, under a plan of reorganization, is to be paid in whole or in part
by a trust described in paragraph (2)(B)(i), except such legal actions as are expressly allowed by the
injunction, the confirmation order, or the plan of reorganization.
(2)(A) Subject to subsection (h), if the requirements of subparagraph (B) are met at the time an
injunction described in paragraph (1) is entered, then after entry of such injunction, any proceeding
that involves the validity, application, construction, or modification of such injunction, or of this
subsection with respect to such injunction, may be commenced only in the district court in which
such injunction was entered, and such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any such
proceeding without regard to the amount in controversy.
(B) The requirements of this subparagraph are that—
(i) the injunction is to be implemented in connection with a trust that, pursuant to the plan of
reorganization—
(I) is to assume the liabilities of a debtor which at the time of entry of the order for relief has
been named as a defendant in personal injury, wrongful death, or property-damage actions
seeking recovery for damages allegedly caused by the presence of, or exposure to, asbestos or
asbestos-containing products;
(II) is to be funded in whole or in part by the securities of 1 or more debtors involved in such
plan and by the obligation of such debtor or debtors to make future payments, including
dividends;
(III) is to own, or by the exercise of rights granted under such plan would be entitled to own
if specified contingencies occur, a majority of the voting shares of—
(aa) each such debtor;
(bb) the parent corporation of each such debtor; or
(cc) a subsidiary of each such debtor that is also a debtor; and
(IV) is to use its assets or income to pay claims and demands; and
(ii) subject to subsection (h), the court determines that—
(I) the debtor is likely to be subject to substantial future demands for payment arising out of
the same or similar conduct or events that gave rise to the claims that are addressed by the
injunction;
(II) the actual amounts, numbers, and timing of such future demands cannot be determined;
(III) pursuit of such demands outside the procedures prescribed by such plan is likely to
threaten the plan's purpose to deal equitably with claims and future demands;
(IV) as part of the process of seeking confirmation of such plan—
(aa) the terms of the injunction proposed to be issued under paragraph (1)(A), including
[Release Point 118-106]
any provisions barring actions against third parties pursuant to paragraph (4)(A), are set out
in such plan and in any disclosure statement supporting the plan; and
(bb) a separate class or classes of the claimants whose claims are to be addressed by a trust
described in clause (i) is established and votes, by at least 75 percent of those voting, in favor
of the plan; and
(V) subject to subsection (h), pursuant to court orders or otherwise, the trust will operate
through mechanisms such as structured, periodic, or supplemental payments, pro rata
distributions, matrices, or periodic review of estimates of the numbers and values of present
claims and future demands, or other comparable mechanisms, that provide reasonable assurance
that the trust will value, and be in a financial position to pay, present claims and future demands
that involve similar claims in substantially the same manner.
(3)(A) If the requirements of paragraph (2)(B) are met and the order confirming the plan of
reorganization was issued or affirmed by the district court that has jurisdiction over the
reorganization case, then after the time for appeal of the order that issues or affirms the plan—
(i) the injunction shall be valid and enforceable and may not be revoked or modified by any
court except through appeal in accordance with paragraph (6);
(ii) no entity that pursuant to such plan or thereafter becomes a direct or indirect transferee of,
or successor to any assets of, a debtor or trust that is the subject of the injunction shall be liable
with respect to any claim or demand made against such entity by reason of its becoming such a
transferee or successor; and
(iii) no entity that pursuant to such plan or thereafter makes a loan to such a debtor or trust or to
such a successor or transferee shall, by reason of making the loan, be liable with respect to any
claim or demand made against such entity, nor shall any pledge of assets made in connection with
such a loan be upset or impaired for that reason;
(B) Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to—
(i) imply that an entity described in subparagraph (A)(ii) or (iii) would, if this paragraph were
not applicable, necessarily be liable to any entity by reason of any of the acts described in
subparagraph (A);
(ii) relieve any such entity of the duty to comply with, or of liability under, any Federal or State
law regarding the making of a fraudulent conveyance in a transaction described in subparagraph
(A)(ii) or (iii); or
(iii) relieve a debtor of the debtor's obligation to comply with the terms of the plan of
reorganization, or affect the power of the court to exercise its authority under sections 1141 and
1142 to compel the debtor to do so.
(4)(A)(i) Subject to subparagraph (B), an injunction described in paragraph (1) shall be valid and
enforceable against all entities that it addresses.
(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 524(e), such an injunction may bar any action
directed against a third party who is identifiable from the terms of such injunction (by name or as
part of an identifiable group) and is alleged to be directly or indirectly liable for the conduct of,
claims against, or demands on the debtor to the extent such alleged liability of such third party arises
by reason of—
(I) the third party's ownership of a financial interest in the debtor, a past or present affiliate of
the debtor, or a predecessor in interest of the debtor;
(II) the third party's involvement in the management of the debtor or a predecessor in interest of
the debtor, or service as an officer, director or employee of the debtor or a related party;
(III) the third party's provision of insurance to the debtor or a related party; or
(IV) the third party's involvement in a transaction changing the corporate structure, or in a loan
or other financial transaction affecting the financial condition, of the debtor or a related party,
including but not limited to—
[Release Point 118-106]
(aa) involvement in providing financing (debt or equity), or advice to an entity involved in
such a transaction; or
(bb) acquiring or selling a financial interest in an entity as part of such a transaction.
(iii) As used in this subparagraph, the term "related party" means—
(I) a past or present affiliate of the debtor;
(II) a predecessor in interest of the debtor; or
(III) any entity that owned a financial interest in—
(aa) the debtor;
(bb) a past or present affiliate of the debtor; or
(cc) a predecessor in interest of the debtor.
(B) Subject to subsection (h), if, under a plan of reorganization, a kind of demand described in
such plan is to be paid in whole or in part by a trust described in paragraph (2)(B)(i) in connection
with which an injunction described in paragraph (1) is to be implemented, then such injunction shall
be valid and enforceable with respect to a demand of such kind made, after such plan is confirmed,
against the debtor or debtors involved, or against a third party described in subparagraph (A)(ii), if—
(i) as part of the proceedings leading to issuance of such injunction, the court appoints a legal
representative for the purpose of protecting the rights of persons that might subsequently assert
demands of such kind, and
(ii) the court determines, before entering the order confirming such plan, that identifying such
debtor or debtors, or such third party (by name or as part of an identifiable group), in such
injunction with respect to such demands for purposes of this subparagraph is fair and equitable
with respect to the persons that might subsequently assert such demands, in light of the benefits
provided, or to be provided, to such trust on behalf of such debtor or debtors or such third party.
(5) In this subsection, the term "demand" means a demand for payment, present or future, that—
(A) was not a claim during the proceedings leading to the confirmation of a plan of
reorganization;
(B) arises out of the same or similar conduct or events that gave rise to the claims addressed by
the injunction issued under paragraph (1); and
(C) pursuant to the plan, is to be paid by a trust described in paragraph (2)(B)(i).
(6) Paragraph (3)(A)(i) does not bar an action taken by or at the direction of an appellate court on
appeal of an injunction issued under paragraph (1) or of the order of confirmation that relates to the
injunction.
(7) This subsection does not affect the operation of section 1144 or the power of the district court
to refer a proceeding under section 157 of title 28 or any reference of a proceeding made prior to the
date of the enactment of this subsection.
(h) APPLICATION TO EXISTING INJUNCTIONS.—For purposes of subsection (g)—
(1) subject to paragraph (2), if an injunction of the kind described in subsection (g)(1)(B) was
issued before the date of the enactment of this Act, as part of a plan of reorganization confirmed
by an order entered before such date, then the injunction shall be considered to meet the
requirements of subsection (g)(2)(B) for purposes of subsection (g)(2)(A), and to satisfy
subsection (g)(4)(A)(ii), if—
(A) the court determined at the time the plan was confirmed that the plan was fair and
equitable in accordance with the requirements of section 1129(b);
(B) as part of the proceedings leading to issuance of such injunction and confirmation of such
plan, the court had appointed a legal representative for the purpose of protecting the rights of
persons that might subsequently assert demands described in subsection (g)(4)(B) with respect
to such plan; and
(C) such legal representative did not object to confirmation of such plan or issuance of such
injunction; and
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) for purposes of paragraph (1), if a trust described in subsection (g)(2)(B)(i) is subject to a
court order on the date of the enactment of this Act staying such trust from settling or paying
further claims—
(A) the requirements of subsection (g)(2)(B)(ii)(V) shall not apply with respect to such trust
until such stay is lifted or dissolved; and
(B) if such trust meets such requirements on the date such stay is lifted or dissolved, such
trust shall be considered to have met such requirements continuously from the date of the
enactment of this Act.
(i) The willful failure of a creditor to credit payments received under a plan confirmed under this
title, unless the order confirming the plan is revoked, the plan is in default, or the creditor has not
received payments required to be made under the plan in the manner required by the plan (including
crediting the amounts required under the plan), shall constitute a violation of an injunction under
subsection (a)(2) if the act of the creditor to collect and failure to credit payments in the manner
required by the plan caused material injury to the debtor.
(j) Subsection (a)(2) does not operate as an injunction against an act by a creditor that is the holder
of a secured claim, if—
(1) such creditor retains a security interest in real property that is the principal residence of the
debtor;
(2) such act is in the ordinary course of business between the creditor and the debtor; and
(3) such act is limited to seeking or obtaining periodic payments associated with a valid security
interest in lieu of pursuit of in rem relief to enforce the lien.
(k)(1) The disclosures required under subsection (c)(2) shall consist of the disclosure statement
described in paragraph (3), completed as required in that paragraph, together with the agreement
specified in subsection (c), statement, declaration, motion and order described, respectively, in
paragraphs (4) through (8), and shall be the only disclosures required in connection with entering

credit plan, as the terms "credit" and "open end credit plan" are defined in section 103 of the
Truth in Lending Act, then—

such periodic statement has been given to the debtor during the prior 6 months, the annual
percentage rate as it would have been so disclosed at the time the disclosure statement is
given to the debtor, or to the extent this annual percentage rate is not readily available or not
applicable, then
(II) the simple interest rate applicable to the amount reaffirmed as of the date the disclosure
statement is given to the debtor, or if different simple interest rates apply to different
balances, the simple interest rate applicable to each such balance, identifying the amount of
each such balance included in the amount reaffirmed, or
(III) if the entity making the disclosure elects, to disclose the annual percentage rate under
subclause (I) and the simple interest rate under subclause (II); or
(ii) if, at the time the petition is filed, the debt is an extension of credit other than under an
open end credit plan, as the terms "credit" and "open end credit plan" are defined in section 103
of the Truth in Lending Act, then—
(I) the annual percentage rate under section 128(a)(4) of the Truth in Lending Act, as
disclosed to the debtor in the most recent disclosure statement given to the debtor prior to the
entering into an agreement of the kind specified in subsection (c) with respect to the debt, or,
if no such disclosure statement was given to the debtor, the annual percentage rate as it would
have been so disclosed at the time the disclosure statement is given to the debtor, or to the
extent this annual percentage rate is not readily available or not applicable, then
(II) the simple interest rate applicable to the amount reaffirmed as of the date the disclosure
statement is given to the debtor, or if different simple interest rates apply to different
balances, the simple interest rate applicable to each such balance, identifying the amount of
such balance included in the amount reaffirmed, or
(III) if the entity making the disclosure elects, to disclose the annual percentage rate under

may be a variable interest rate which changes from time to time, so that the annual percentage rate
disclosed here may be higher or lower.".

determined to be void by a final order of the court at the time of the disclosure, by disclosing that a
security interest or lien in goods or property is asserted over some or all of the debts the debtor is
reaffirming and listing the items and their original purchase price that are subject to the asserted
security interest, or if not a purchase-money security interest then listing by items or types and the
original amount of the loan.

(i) by making the statement: "Your first payment in the amount of $______ is due on ______
but the future payment amount may be different. Consult your reaffirmation agreement or credit
agreement, as applicable.", and stating the amount of the first payment and the due date of that
payment in the places provided;
(ii) by making the statement: "Your payment schedule will be:", and describing the
repayment schedule with the number, amount, and due dates or period of payments scheduled to
repay the debts reaffirmed to the extent then known by the disclosing party; or
[Release Point 118-106]
(iii) by describing the debtor's repayment obligations with reasonable specificity to the extent
then known by the disclosing party.
(I) The following statement: "Note: When this disclosure refers to what a creditor 'may' do, it
does not use the word 'may' to give the creditor specific permission. The word 'may' is used to tell
you what might occur if the law permits the creditor to take the action. If you have questions about
your reaffirming a debt or what the law requires, consult with the attorney who helped you
negotiate this agreement reaffirming a debt. If you don't have an attorney helping you, the judge
will explain the effect of your reaffirming a debt when the hearing on the reaffirmation agreement
is held.".
(J)(i) The following additional statements:
"Reaffirming a debt is a serious financial decision. The law requires you to take certain steps to
make sure the decision is in your best interest. If these steps are not completed, the reaffirmation
agreement is not effective, even though you have signed it.
"1. Read the disclosures in this Part A carefully. Consider the decision to reaffirm carefully.
Then, if you want to reaffirm, sign the reaffirmation agreement in Part B (or you may use a
separate agreement you and your creditor agree on).
"2. Complete and sign Part D and be sure you can afford to make the payments you are agreeing
to make and have received a copy of the disclosure statement and a completed and signed
reaffirmation agreement.
"3. If you were represented by an attorney during the negotiation of your reaffirmation
agreement, the attorney must have signed the certification in Part C.
"4. If you were not represented by an attorney during the negotiation of your reaffirmation
agreement, you must have completed and signed Part E.
"5. The original of this disclosure must be filed with the court by you or your creditor. If a
separate reaffirmation agreement (other than the one in Part B) has been signed, it must be
attached.
"6. If you were represented by an attorney during the negotiation of your reaffirmation
agreement, your reaffirmation agreement becomes effective upon filing with the court unless the
reaffirmation is presumed to be an undue hardship as explained in Part D.
"7. If you were not represented by an attorney during the negotiation of your reaffirmation
agreement, it will not be effective unless the court approves it. The court will notify you of the
hearing on your reaffirmation agreement. You must attend this hearing in bankruptcy court where
the judge will review your reaffirmation agreement. The bankruptcy court must approve your
reaffirmation agreement as consistent with your best interests, except that no court approval is
required if your reaffirmation agreement is for a consumer debt secured by a mortgage, deed of
trust, security deed, or other lien on your real property, like your home.
"Your right to rescind (cancel) your reaffirmation agreement. You may rescind (cancel) your
reaffirmation agreement at any time before the bankruptcy court enters a discharge order, or before
the expiration of the 60-day period that begins on the date your reaffirmation agreement is filed with
the court, whichever occurs later. To rescind (cancel) your reaffirmation agreement, you must notify
the creditor that your reaffirmation agreement is rescinded (or canceled).
"What are your obligations if you reaffirm the debt? A reaffirmed debt remains your personal legal
obligation. It is not discharged in your bankruptcy case. That means that if you default on your
reaffirmed debt after your bankruptcy case is over, your creditor may be able to take your property or
your wages. Otherwise, your obligations will be determined by the reaffirmation agreement which
may have changed the terms of the original agreement. For example, if you are reaffirming an open
end credit agreement, the creditor may be permitted by that agreement or applicable law to change
the terms of that agreement in the future under certain conditions.
"Are you required to enter into a reaffirmation agreement by any law? No, you are not required to
reaffirm a debt by any law. Only agree to reaffirm a debt if it is in your best interest. Be sure you can
[Release Point 118-106]
afford the payments you agree to make.
"What if your creditor has a security interest or lien? Your bankruptcy discharge does not
eliminate any lien on your property. A 'lien' is often referred to as a security interest, deed of trust,
mortgage or security deed. Even if you do not reaffirm and your personal liability on the debt is
discharged, because of the lien your creditor may still have the right to take the property securing the
lien if you do not pay the debt or default on it. If the lien is on an item of personal property that is
exempt under your State's law or that the trustee has abandoned, you may be able to redeem the item
rather than reaffirm the debt. To redeem, you must make a single payment to the creditor equal to the
amount of the allowed secured claim, as agreed by the parties or determined by the court.".
(ii) In the case of a reaffirmation under subsection (m)(2), numbered paragraph 6 in the
disclosures required by clause (i) of this subparagraph shall read as follows:
"6. If you were represented by an attorney during the negotiation of your reaffirmation
agreement, your reaffirmation agreement becomes effective upon filing with the court.".
(4) The form of such agreement required under this paragraph shall consist of the following:
"Part B: Reaffirmation Agreement. I (we) agree to reaffirm the debts arising under the credit
agreement described below.

"Borrower:
"Co-borrower, if also reaffirming these debts:
"Accepted by creditor:

(5) The declaration shall consist of the following:
(A) The following certification:
"Part C: Certification by Debtor's Attorney (If Any).
"I hereby certify that (1) this agreement represents a fully informed and voluntary agreement by
the debtor; (2) this agreement does not impose an undue hardship on the debtor or any dependent of
the debtor; and (3) I have fully advised the debtor of the legal effect and consequences of this
agreement and any default under this agreement.
"Signature of Debtor's Attorney: Date:".
(B) If a presumption of undue hardship has been established with respect to such agreement,
such certification shall state that, in the opinion of the attorney, the debtor is able to make the
payment.
(C) In the case of a reaffirmation agreement under subsection (m)(2), subparagraph (B) is not
applicable.
(6)(A) The statement in support of such agreement, which the debtor shall sign and date prior to
filing with the court, shall consist of the following:
"Part D: Debtor's Statement in Support of Reaffirmation Agreement.
"1. I believe this reaffirmation agreement will not impose an undue hardship on my dependents or
me. I can afford to make the payments on the reaffirmed debt because my monthly income (take
home pay plus any other income received) is $______, and my actual current monthly expenses
including monthly payments on post-bankruptcy debt and other reaffirmation agreements total
$______, leaving $______ to make the required payments on this reaffirmed debt. I understand that
if my income less my monthly expenses does not leave enough to make the payments, this
reaffirmation agreement is presumed to be an undue hardship on me and must be reviewed by the
court. However, this presumption may be overcome if I explain to the satisfaction of the court how I
can afford to make the payments here: ______.
"2. I received a copy of the Reaffirmation Disclosure Statement in Part A and a completed and
signed reaffirmation agreement.".

(B) Where the debtor is represented by an attorney and is reaffirming a debt owed to a creditor
defined in section 19(b)(1)(A)(iv) of the Federal Reserve Act, the statement of support of the
reaffirmation agreement, which the debtor shall sign and date prior to filing with the court, shall
consist of the following:
"I believe this reaffirmation agreement is in my financial interest. I can afford to make the
payments on the reaffirmed debt. I received a copy of the Reaffirmation Disclosure Statement in Part
A and a completed and signed reaffirmation agreement.".
(7) The motion that may be used if approval of such agreement by the court is required in order for
it to be effective, shall be signed and dated by the movant and shall consist of the following:
"Part E: Motion for Court Approval (To be completed only if the debtor is not represented by an
attorney.). I (we), the debtor(s), affirm the following to be true and correct:
"I am not represented by an attorney in connection with this reaffirmation agreement.
"I believe this reaffirmation agreement is in my best interest based on the income and expenses I
have disclosed in my Statement in Support of this reaffirmation agreement, and because (provide any
additional relevant reasons the court should consider):
"Therefore, I ask the court for an order approving this reaffirmation agreement.".
(8) The court order, which may be used to approve such agreement, shall consist of the following:
"Court Order: The court grants the debtor's motion and approves the reaffirmation agreement
described above.".
(l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title the following shall apply:
(1) A creditor may accept payments from a debtor before and after the filing of an agreement of
the kind specified in subsection (c) with the court.
(2) A creditor may accept payments from a debtor under such agreement that the creditor
believes in good faith to be effective.
(3) The requirements of subsections (c)(2) and (k) shall be satisfied if disclosures required
under those subsections are given in good faith.
(m)(1) Until 60 days after an agreement of the kind specified in subsection (c) is filed with the
court (or such additional period as the court, after notice and a hearing and for cause, orders before
the expiration of such period), it shall be presumed that such agreement is an undue hardship on the
debtor if the debtor's monthly income less the debtor's monthly expenses as shown on the debtor's
completed and signed statement in support of such agreement required under subsection (k)(6)(A) is
less than the scheduled payments on the reaffirmed debt. This presumption shall be reviewed by the
court. The presumption may be rebutted in writing by the debtor if the statement includes an
explanation that identifies additional sources of funds to make the payments as agreed upon under
the terms of such agreement. If the presumption is not rebutted to the satisfaction of the court, the
court may disapprove such agreement. No agreement shall be disapproved without notice and a
hearing to the debtor and creditor, and such hearing shall be concluded before the entry of the
debtor's discharge.
(2) This subsection does not apply to reaffirmation agreements where the creditor is a credit union,
as defined in section 19(b)(1)(A)(iv) of the Federal Reserve Act.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 524(a) of the House amendment represents a compromise between the House bill and the Senate
amendment. Section 524(b) of the House amendment is new, and represents standards clarifying the operation
of section 524(a)(3) with respect to community property.
[Release Point 118-106]
Sections 524(c) and (d) represent a compromise between the House bill and Senate amendment on the issue
of reaffirmation of a debt discharged in bankruptcy. Every reaffirmation to be enforceable must be approved
by the court, and any debtor may rescind a reaffirmation for 30 days from the time the reaffirmation becomes
enforceable. If the debtor is an individual the court must advise the debtor of various effects of reaffirmation
at a hearing. In addition, to any extent the debt is a consumer debt that is not secured by real property of the
debtor reaffirmation is permitted only if the court approves the reaffirmation agreement, before granting a
discharge under section 727, 1141, or 1328, as not imposing a hardship on the debtor or a dependent of the
debtor and in the best interest of the debtor; alternatively, the court may approve an agreement entered into in
good faith that is in settlement of litigation of a complaint to determine dischargeability or that is entered into
in connection with redemption under section 722. The hearing on discharge under section 524(d) will be held
whether or not the debtor desires to reaffirm any debts.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) specifies that a discharge in a bankruptcy case voids any judgment to the extent that it is a
determination of the personal liability of the debtor with respect to a prepetition debt, and operates as an
injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action, the employment of process, or any act,
including telephone calls, letters, and personal contacts, to collect, recover, or offset any discharged debt as a
personal liability of the debtor, or from property of the debtor, whether or not the debtor has waived discharge
of the debt involved. The injunction is to give complete effect to the discharge and to eliminate any doubt
concerning the effect of the discharge as a total prohibition on debt collection efforts. This paragraph has been
expanded over a comparable provision in Bankruptcy Act §14f [section 32(f) of former title 11] to cover any
act to collect, such as dunning by telephone or letter, or indirectly through friends, relatives, or employers,
harassment, threats of repossession, and the like. The change is consonant with the new policy forbidding
binding reaffirmation agreements under proposed 11 U.S.C. 524(b), and is intended to insure that once a debt
is discharged, the debtor will not be pressured in any way to repay it. In effect, the discharge extinguishes the
debt, and creditors may not attempt to avoid that. The language "whether or not discharge of such debt is
waived" is intended to prevent waiver of discharge of a particular debt from defeating the purposes of this
section. It is directed at waiver of discharge of a particular debt, not waiver of discharge in toto as permitted
under section 727(a)(9).
Subsection (a) also codifies the split discharge for debtors in community property states. If community
property was in the estate and community claims were discharged, the discharge is effective against
community creditors of the nondebtor spouse as well as of the debtor spouse.
Subsection (b) gives further effect to the discharge. It prohibits reaffirmation agreements after the
commencement of the case with respect to any dischargeable debt. The prohibition extends to agreements the
consideration for which in whole or in part is based on a dischargeable debt, and it applies whether or not
discharge of the debt involved in the agreement has been waived. Thus, the prohibition on reaffirmation
agreements extends to debts that are based on discharged debts. Thus, "second generation" debts, which
included all or a part of a discharged debt could not be included in any new agreement for new money. This
subsection will not have any effect on reaffirmations of debts discharged under the Bankruptcy Act [former
title 11]. It will only apply to discharges granted if commenced under the new title 11 bankruptcy code.
Subsection (c) grants an exception to the anti-reaffirmation provision. It permits reaffirmation in connection
with the settlement of a proceeding to determine the dischargeability of the debt being reaffirmed, or in
connection with a redemption agreement permitted under section 722. In either case, the reaffirmation
agreement must be entered into in good faith and must be approved by the court.
Subsection (d) provides the discharge of the debtor does not affect co-debtors or guarantors.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section is additional debtor protection. It codifies the result of Perez v. Campbell, 402 U.S. 637 (1971),
which held that a State would frustrate the Congressional policy of a fresh start for a debtor if it were
permitted to refuse to renew a drivers license because a tort judgment resulting from an automobile accident
had been unpaid as a result of a discharge in bankruptcy.
Notwithstanding any other laws, section 525 prohibits a governmental unit from denying, revoking,
suspending, or refusing to renew a license, permit, charter, franchise, or other similar grant to, from
conditioning such a grant to, from discrimination with respect to such a grant against, deny employment to,
terminate the employment of, or discriminate with respect to employment against, a person that is or has been
a debtor or that is or has been associated with a debtor. The prohibition extends only to discrimination or other
action based solely on the basis of the bankruptcy, on the basis of insolvency before or during bankruptcy
prior to a determination of discharge, or on the basis of nonpayment of a debt discharged in the bankruptcy
case (the Perez situation). It does not prohibit consideration of other factors, such as future financial
responsibility or ability, and does not prohibit imposition of requirements such as net capital rules, if applied
nondiscriminatorily.
In addition, the section is not exhaustive. The enumeration of various forms of discrimination against
former bankrupts is not intended to permit other forms of discrimination. The courts have been developing the
Perez rule. This section permits further development to prohibit actions by governmental or
quasi-governmental organizations that perform licensing functions, such as a State bar association or a
medical society, or by other organizations that can seriously affect the debtors' livelihood or fresh start, such
as exclusion from a union on the basis of discharge of a debt to the union's credit union.
The effect of the section, and of further interpretations of the Perez rule, is to strengthen the
anti-reaffirmation policy found in section 524(b). Discrimination based solely on nonpayment could
encourage reaffirmations, contrary to the expressed policy.
The section is not so broad as a comparable section proposed by the Bankruptcy Commission, S. 236, 94th
Cong., 1st Sess. §4–508 (1975), which would have extended the prohibition to any discrimination, even by
private parties. Nevertheless, it is not limiting either, as noted. The courts will continue to mark the contours
of the anti-discrimination provision in pursuit of sound bankruptcy policy.

(A) all information that the assisted person is required to provide with a petition and

(B) all assets and all liabilities are required to be completely and accurately disclosed in the

(b) A debt relief agency providing bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person shall provide each
[Release Point 118-106]
assisted person at the same time as the notices required under subsection (a)(1) the following
statement, to the extent applicable, or one substantially similar. The statement shall be clear and
conspicuous and shall be in a single document separate from other documents or notices provided to
the assisted person:
"IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT BANKRUPTCY ASSISTANCE SERVICES FROM
AN ATTORNEY OR BANKRUPTCY PETITION PREPARER.
"If you decide to seek bankruptcy relief, you can represent yourself, you can hire an attorney to
represent you, or you can get help in some localities from a bankruptcy petition preparer who is not
an attorney. THE LAW REQUIRES AN ATTORNEY OR BANKRUPTCY PETITION
PREPARER TO GIVE YOU A WRITTEN CONTRACT SPECIFYING WHAT THE ATTORNEY
OR BANKRUPTCY PETITION PREPARER WILL DO FOR YOU AND HOW MUCH IT WILL
COST. Ask to see the contract before you hire anyone.
"The following information helps you understand what must be done in a routine bankruptcy case
to help you evaluate how much service you need. Although bankruptcy can be complex, many cases
are routine.
"Before filing a bankruptcy case, either you or your attorney should analyze your eligibility for
different forms of debt relief available under the Bankruptcy Code and which form of relief is most
likely to be beneficial for you. Be sure you understand the relief you can obtain and its limitations.
To file a bankruptcy case, documents called a Petition, Schedules, and Statement of Financial
Affairs, and in some cases a Statement of Intention, need to be prepared correctly and filed with the
bankruptcy court. You will have to pay a filing fee to the bankruptcy court. Once your case starts,
you will have to attend the required first meeting of creditors where you may be questioned by a
court official called a 'trustee' and by creditors.
"If you choose to file a chapter 7 case, you may be asked by a creditor to reaffirm a debt. You may
want help deciding whether to do so. A creditor is not permitted to coerce you into reaffirming your
debts.
"If you choose to file a chapter 13 case in which you repay your creditors what you can afford
over 3 to 5 years, you may also want help with preparing your chapter 13 plan and with the
confirmation hearing on your plan which will be before a bankruptcy judge.
"If you select another type of relief under the Bankruptcy Code other than chapter 7 or chapter 13,
you will want to find out what should be done from someone familiar with that type of relief.
"Your bankruptcy case may also involve litigation. You are generally permitted to represent
yourself in litigation in bankruptcy court, but only attorneys, not bankruptcy petition preparers, can
give you legal advice.".
(c) Except to the extent the debt relief agency provides the required information itself after
reasonably diligent inquiry of the assisted person or others so as to obtain such information
reasonably accurately for inclusion on the petition, schedules or statement of financial affairs, a debt
relief agency providing bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person, to the extent permitted by
nonbankruptcy law, shall provide each assisted person at the time required for the notice required
under subsection (a)(1) reasonably sufficient information (which shall be provided in a clear and
conspicuous writing) to the assisted person on how to provide all the information the assisted person
is required to provide under this title pursuant to section 521, including—
(1) how to value assets at replacement value, determine current monthly income, the amounts
specified in section 707(b)(2) and, in a chapter 13 case, how to determine disposable income in
accordance with section 707(b)(2) and related calculations;
(2) how to complete the list of creditors, including how to determine what amount is owed and
what address for the creditor should be shown; and
(3) how to determine what property is exempt and how to value exempt property at replacement
value as defined in section 506.
(d) A debt relief agency shall maintain a copy of the notices required under subsection (a) of this
section for 2 years after the date on which the notice is given the assisted person.

chapter 13 is specifically mentioned in such advertisement; and
(B) statements such as "federally supervised repayment plan" or "Federal debt restructuring
help" or other similar statements that could lead a reasonable consumer to believe that debt
counseling was being offered when in fact the services were directed to providing bankruptcy
assistance with a chapter 13 plan or other form of bankruptcy relief under this title.
(2) An advertisement, directed to the general public, indicating that the debt relief agency provides
assistance with respect to credit defaults, mortgage foreclosures, eviction proceedings, excessive
debt, debt collection pressure, or inability to pay any consumer debt shall—

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 541(a)(7) is new. The provision clarifies that any interest in property that the estate acquires after
the commencement of the case is property of the estate; for example, if the estate enters into a contract, after
the commencement of the case, such a contract would be property of the estate. The addition of this provision
by the House amendment merely clarifies that section 541(a) is an all-embracing definition which includes
charges on property, such as liens held by the debtor on property of a third party, or beneficial rights and
interests that the debtor may have in property of another. However, only the debtor's interest in such property
becomes property of the estate. If the debtor holds bare legal title or holds property in trust for another, only
those rights which the debtor would have otherwise had emanating from such interest pass to the estate under
section 541. Neither this section nor section 545 will affect various statutory provisions that give a creditor a
lien that is valid both inside and outside bankruptcy against a bona fide purchaser of property from the debtor,
or that creates a trust fund for the benefit of creditors meeting similar criteria. See Packers and Stockyards Act
§206, 7 U.S.C. 196 (1976).
Section 541(c)(2) follows the position taken in the House bill and rejects the position taken in the Senate
amendment with respect to income limitations on a spend-thrift trust.
Section 541(d) of the House amendment is derived from section 541(e) of the Senate amendment and
[Release Point 118-106]
reiterates the general principle that where the debtor holds bare legal title without any equitable interest, that
the estate acquires bare legal title without any equitable interest in the property. The purpose of section 541(d)
as applied to the secondary mortgage market is identical to the purpose of section 541(e) of the Senate
amendment and section 541(d) will accomplish the same result as would have been accomplished by section
541(e). Even if a mortgage seller retains for purposes of servicing legal title to mortgages or interests in
mortgages sold in the secondary mortgage market, the trustee would be required by section 541(d) to turn over
the mortgages or interests in mortgages to the purchaser of those mortgages.
The seller of mortgages in the secondary mortgage market will often retain the original mortgage notes and
related documents and the seller will not endorse the notes to reflect the sale to the purchaser. Similarly, the
purchaser will often not record the purchaser's ownership of the mortgages or interests in mortgages under
State recording statutes. These facts are irrelevant and the seller's retention of the mortgage documents and the
purchaser's decision not to record do not change the trustee's obligation to turn the mortgages or interests in
mortgages over to the purchaser. The application of section 541(d) to secondary mortgage market transactions
will not be affected by the terms of the servicing agreement between the mortgage servicer and the purchaser
of the mortgages. Under section 541(d), the trustee is required to recognize the purchaser's title to the
mortgages or interests in mortgages and to turn this property over to the purchaser. It makes no difference
whether the servicer and the purchaser characterize their relationship as one of trust, agency, or independent
contractor.
The purpose of section 541(d) as applied to the secondary mortgage market is therefore to make certain that
secondary mortgage market sales as they are currently structured are not subject to challenge by bankruptcy
trustees and that purchasers of mortgages will be able to obtain the mortgages or interests in mortgages which
they have purchased from trustees without the trustees asserting that a sale of mortgages is a loan from the
purchaser to the seller.
Thus, as section 541(a)(1) clearly states, the estate is comprised of all legal or equitable interests of the
debtor in property as of the commencement of the case. To the extent such an interest is limited in the hands
of the debtor, it is equally limited in the hands of the estate except to the extent that defenses which are
personal against the debtor are not effective against the estate.
Property of the estate: The Senate amendment provided that property of the estate does not include amounts
held by the debtor as trustee and any taxes withheld or collected from others before the commencement of the
case. The House amendment removes these two provisions. As to property held by the debtor as a trustee, the
House amendment provides that property of the estate will include whatever interest the debtor held in the
property at the commencement of the case. Thus, where the debtor held only legal title to the property and the
beneficial interest in that property belongs to another, such as exists in the case of property held in trust, the
property of the estate includes the legal title, but not the beneficial interest in the property.
As to withheld taxes, the House amendment deletes the rule in the Senate bill as unnecessary since property
of the estate does not include the beneficial interest in property held by the debtor as a trustee. Under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (section 7501) [26 U.S.C. 7501], the amounts of withheld taxes are held to be
a special fund in trust for the United States. Where the Internal Revenue Service can demonstrate that the
amounts of taxes withheld are still in the possession of the debtor at the commencement of the case, then if a
trust is created, those amounts are not property of the estate. Compare In re Shakesteers Coffee Shops, 546
F.2d 821 (9th Cir. 1976) with In re Glynn Wholesale Building Materials, Inc. (S.D. Ga. 1978) and In re
Progress Tech Colleges, Inc., 42 Aftr 2d 78–5573 (S.D. Ohio 1977).
Where it is not possible for the Internal Revenue Service to demonstrate that the amounts of taxes withheld
are still in the possession of the debtor at the commencement of the case, present law generally includes
amounts of withheld taxes as property of the estate. See, e.g., United States v. Randall, 401 U.S. 513 (1973)
[91 S. Ct. 991, 28 L.Ed.2d 273] and In re Tamasha Town and Country Club, 483 F.2d 1377 (9th Cir. 1973).
Nonetheless, a serious problem exists where "trust fund taxes" withheld from others are held to be property of
the estate where the withheld amounts are commingled with other assets of the debtor. The courts should
permit the use of reasonable assumptions under which the Internal Revenue Service, and other tax authorities,
can demonstrate that amounts of withheld taxes are still in the possession of the debtor at the commencement
of the case. For example, where the debtor had commingled that amount of withheld taxes in his general
checking account, it might be reasonable to assume that any remaining amounts in that account on the
commencement of the case are the withheld taxes. In addition, Congress may consider future amendments to
the Internal Revenue Code [title 26] making clear that amounts of withheld taxes are held by the debtor in a
trust relationship and, consequently, that such amounts are not property of the estate.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section defines property of the estate, and specifies what property becomes property of the estate. The
[Release Point 118-106]
commencement of a bankruptcy case creates an estate. Under paragraph (1) of subsection (a), the estate is
comprised of all legal or equitable interest of the debtor in property, wherever located, as of the
commencement of the case. The scope of this paragraph is broad. It includes all kinds of property, including
tangible or intangible property, causes of action (see Bankruptcy Act §70a(6) [section 110(a)(6) of former title
11]), and all other forms of property currently specified in section 70a of the Bankruptcy Act §70a [section
110(a) of former title 11], as well as property recovered by the trustee under section 542 of proposed title 11,
if the property recovered was merely out of the possession of the debtor, yet remained "property of the
debtor." The debtor's interest in property also includes "title" to property, which is an interest, just as are a
possessory interest, or lease-hold interest, for example. The result of Segal v. Rochelle, 382 U.S. 375 (1966),
is followed, and the right to a refund is property of the estate.
Though this paragraph will include choses in action and claims by the debtor against others, it is not
intended to expand the debtor's rights against others more than they exist at the commencement of the case.
For example, if the debtor has a claim that is barred at the time of the commencement of the case by the
statute of limitations, then the trustee would not be able to pursue that claim, because he too would be barred.
He could take no greater rights than the debtor himself had. But see proposed 11 U.S.C. 108, which would
permit the trustee a tolling of the statute of limitations if it had not run before the date of the filing of the
petition.
Paragraph (1) has the effect of overruling Lockwood v. Exchange Bank, 190 U.S. 294 (1903), because it
includes as property of the estate all property of the debtor, even that needed for a fresh start. After the
property comes into the estate, then the debtor is permitted to exempt it under proposed 11 U.S.C. 522, and the
court will have jurisdiction to determine what property may be exempted and what remains as property of the
estate. The broad jurisdictional grant in proposed 28 U.S.C. 1334 would have the effect of overruling
Lockwood independently of the change made by this provision.
Paragraph (1) also has the effect of overruling Lines v. Frederick, 400 U.S. 18 (1970).
Situations occasionally arise where property ostensibly belonging to the debtor will actually not be property
of the debtor, but will be held in trust for another. For example, if the debtor has incurred medical bills that
were covered by insurance, and the insurance company had sent the payment of the bills to the debtor before
the debtor had paid the bill for which the payment was reimbursement, the payment would actually be held in
a constructive trust for the person to whom the bill was owed. This section and proposed 11 U.S.C. 545 also
will not affect various statutory provisions that give a creditor of the debtor a lien that is valid outside as well
as inside bankruptcy, or that creates a trust fund for the benefit of a creditor of the debtor. See Packers and
Stockyards Act §206, 7 U.S.C. 196.
Bankruptcy Act §8 [section 26 of former title 11] has been deleted as unnecessary. Once the estate is
created, no interests in property of the estate remain in the debtor. Consequently, if the debtor dies during the
case, only property exempted from property of the estate or acquired by the debtor after the commencement of
the case and not included as property of the estate will be available to the representative of the debtor's probate
estate. The bankruptcy proceeding will continue in rem with respect to property of the state, and the discharge
will apply in personam to relieve the debtor, and thus his probate representative, of liability for dischargeable
debts.
The estate also includes the interests of the debtor and the debtor's spouse in community property, subject to
certain limitations; property that the trustee recovers under the avoiding powers; property that the debtor
acquires by bequest, devise, inheritance, a property settlement agreement with the debtor's spouse, or as the
beneficiary of a life insurance policy within 180 days after the petition; and proceeds, product, offspring,
rents, and profits of or from property of the estate, except such as are earning from services performed by an
individual debtor after the commencement of the case. Proceeds here is not used in a confining sense, as
defined in the Uniform Commercial Code, but is intended to be a broad term to encompass all proceeds of
property of the estate. The conversion in form of property of the estate does not change its character as
property of the estate.
Subsection (b) excludes from property of the estate any power, such as a power of appointment, that the
debtor may exercise solely for the benefit of an entity other than the debtor. This changes present law which
excludes powers solely benefiting other persons but not other entities.
Subsection (c) invalidates restrictions on the transfer of property of the debtor, in order that all of the
interests of the debtor in property will become property of the estate. The provisions invalidated are those that
restrict or condition transfer of the debtor's interest, and those that are conditioned on the insolvency or
financial condition of the debtor, on the commencement of a bankruptcy case, or on the appointment of a
custodian of the debtor's property. Paragraph (2) of subsection (c), however, preserves restrictions on a
transfer of a spendthrift trust that the restriction is enforceable nonbankruptcy law to the extent of the income
reasonably necessary for the support of a debtor and his dependents.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subsection (d) [enacted as (e)], derived from section 70c of the Bankruptcy Act [section 110(c) of former
title 11], gives the estate the benefit of all defenses available to the debtor as against an entity other than the
estate, including such defenses as statutes of limitations, statutes of frauds, usury, and other personal defenses,
and makes waiver by the debtor after the commencement of the case ineffective to bind the estate.
Section 541(e) [enacted as (d)] confirms the current status under the Bankruptcy Act [former title 11] of
bona fide secondary mortgage market transactions as the purchase and sale of assets. Mortgages or interests in
mortgages sold in the secondary market should not be considered as part of the debtor's estate. To permit the
efficient servicing of mortgages or interests in mortgages the seller often retains the original mortgage notes
and related documents, and the purchaser records under State recording statutes the purchaser's ownership of
the mortgages or interests in mortgages purchased. Section 541(e) makes clear that the seller's retention of the
mortgage documents and the purchaser's decision not to record do not impair the asset sale character of
secondary mortgage market transactions. The committee notes that in secondary mortgage market transactions
the parties may characterize their relationship as one of trust, agency, or independent contractor. The
characterization adopted by the parties should not affect the statutes in bankruptcy on bona fide secondary
mortgage market purchases and sales.

§542. Turnover of property to the estate
(a) Except as provided in subsection (c) or (d) of this section, an entity, other than a custodian, in
possession, custody, or control, during the case, of property that the trustee may use, sell, or lease
under section 363 of this title, or that the debtor may exempt under section 522 of this title, shall
deliver to the trustee, and account for, such property or the value of such property, unless such
property is of inconsequential value or benefit to the estate.
(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) or (d) of this section, an entity that owes a debt that is
property of the estate and that is matured, payable on demand, or payable on order, shall pay such
debt to, or on the order of, the trustee, except to the extent that such debt may be offset under section
553 of this title against a claim against the debtor.
(c) Except as provided in section 362(a)(7) of this title, an entity that has neither actual notice nor
actual knowledge of the commencement of the case concerning the debtor may transfer property of
the estate, or pay a debt owing to the debtor, in good faith and other than in the manner specified in

commenced.
(d) A life insurance company may transfer property of the estate or property of the debtor to such
company in good faith, with the same effect with respect to such company as if the case under this

out a nonforfeiture insurance option, and is required to be made automatically, under a life insurance
contract with such company that was entered into before the date of the filing of the petition and that
is property of the estate.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 542(a) of the House amendment modifies similar provisions contained in the House bill and the
Senate amendment treating with turnover of property to the estate. The section makes clear that any entity,
other than a custodian, is required to deliver property of the estate to the trustee or debtor in possession
whenever such property is acquired by the entity during the case, if the trustee or debtor in possession may
use, sell, or lease the property under section 363, or if the debtor may exempt the property under section 522,
unless the property is of inconsequential value or benefit to the estate. This section is not intended to require
an entity to deliver property to the trustee if such entity has obtained an order of the court authorizing the
entity to retain possession, custody or control of the property.
The House amendment adopts section 542(c) of the House bill in preference to a similar provision
[Release Point 118-106]
contained in section 542(c) of the Senate amendment. Protection afforded by section 542(c) applies only to the
transferor or payor and not to a transferee or payee receiving a transfer or payment, as the case may be. Such
transferee or payee is treated under section 549 and section 550 of title 11.
The extent to which the attorney client privilege is valid against the trustee is unclear under current law and
is left to be determined by the courts on a case by case basis.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) of this section requires anyone holding property of the estate on the date of the filing of the
petition, or property that the trustee may use, sell, or lease under section 363, to deliver it to the trustee. The
subsection also requires an accounting. The holder of property of the estate is excused from the turnover
requirement of this subsection if the property held is of inconsequential value to the estate. However, this
provision must be read in conjunction with the remainder of the subsection, so that if the property is of
inconsequential monetary value, yet has a significant use value for the estate, the holder of the property would
not be excused from turnover.
Subsection (b) requires an entity that owes money to the debtor as of the date of the petition, or that holds
money payable on demand or payable on order, to pay the money to the order of the trustee. An exception is
made to the extent that the entity has a valid right of setoff, as recognized by section 553.
Subsection (c) provides an exception to subsections (a) and (b). It protects an entity that has neither actual
notice nor actual knowledge of the case and that transfers, in good faith, property that is deliverable or payable
to the trustee to someone other than to the estate or on order of the estate. This subsection codifies the result of
Bank of Marin v. England, 385 U.S. 99 (1966), but does not go so far as to permit bank setoff in violation of
the automatic stay, proposed 11 U.S.C. 362(a)(7), even if the bank offsetting the debtor's balance has no
knowledge of the case.
Subsection (d) protects life insurance companies that are required by contract to make automatic premium
loans from property that might otherwise be property of the estate.
Subsection (e) requires an attorney, accountant, or other professional that holds recorded information
relating to the debtor's property or financial affairs, to surrender it to the trustee. This duty is subject to any
applicable claim of privilege, such as attorney-client privilege. It is a new provision that deprives accountants
and attorneys of the leverage that they have today, under State law lien provisions, to receive payment in full
ahead of other creditors when the information they hold is necessary to the administration of the estate.

§543. Turnover of property by a custodian
(a) A custodian with knowledge of the commencement of a case under this title concerning the
debtor may not make any disbursement from, or take any action in the administration of, property of
the debtor, proceeds, product, offspring, rents, or profits of such property, or property of the estate, in
the possession, custody, or control of such custodian, except such action as is necessary to preserve
such property.
(b) A custodian shall—
[Release Point 118-106]
(1) deliver to the trustee any property of the debtor held by or transferred to such custodian, or
proceeds, product, offspring, rents, or profits of such property, that is in such custodian's
possession, custody, or control on the date that such custodian acquires knowledge of the
commencement of the case; and
(2) file an accounting of any property of the debtor, or proceeds, product, offspring, rents, or
profits of such property, that, at any time, came into the possession, custody, or control of such
custodian.
(c) The court, after notice and a hearing, shall—
(1) protect all entities to which a custodian has become obligated with respect to such property
or proceeds, product, offspring, rents, or profits of such property;
(2) provide for the payment of reasonable compensation for services rendered and costs and
expenses incurred by such custodian; and
(3) surcharge such custodian, other than an assignee for the benefit of the debtor's creditors that
was appointed or took possession more than 120 days before the date of the filing of the petition,
for any improper or excessive disbursement, other than a disbursement that has been made in
accordance with applicable law or that has been approved, after notice and a hearing, by a court of
competent jurisdiction before the commencement of the case under this title.
(d) After notice and hearing, the bankruptcy court—
(1) may excuse compliance with subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section if the interests of
creditors and, if the debtor is not insolvent, of equity security holders would be better served by
permitting a custodian to continue in possession, custody, or control of such property, and
(2) shall excuse compliance with subsections (a) and (b)(1) of this section if the custodian is an
assignee for the benefit of the debtor's creditors that was appointed or took possession more than
120 days before the date of the filing of the petition, unless compliance with such subsections is
necessary to prevent fraud or injustice.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 543(a) is a modification of similar provisions contained in the House bill and the Senate
amendment. The provision clarifies that a custodian may always act as is necessary to preserve property of the
debtor. Section 543(c)(3) excepts from surcharge a custodian that is an assignee for the benefit of creditors,
who was appointed or took possession before 120 days before the date of the filing of the petition, whichever
is later. The provision also prevents a custodian from being surcharged in connection with payments made in
accordance with applicable law.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section requires a custodian appointed before the bankruptcy case to deliver to the trustee and to
account for property that has come into his possession, custody, or control as a custodian. "Property of the
debtor" in section (a) includes property that was property of the debtor at the time the custodian took the
property, but the title to which passed to the custodian. The section requires the court to protect any
obligations incurred by the custodian, provide for the payment of reasonable compensation for services
rendered and costs and expenses incurred by the custodian, and to surcharge the custodian for any improper or
excessive disbursement, unless it has been approved by a court of competent jurisdiction. Subsection (d)
reinforces the general abstention policy in section 305 by permitting the bankruptcy court to authorize the
custodianship to proceed notwithstanding this section.

property of the debtor or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable by—
(1) a creditor that extends credit to the debtor at the time of the commencement of the case, and
that obtains, at such time and with respect to such credit, a judicial lien on all property on which a
creditor on a simple contract could have obtained such a judicial lien, whether or not such a
creditor exists;
(2) a creditor that extends credit to the debtor at the time of the commencement of the case, and
obtains, at such time and with respect to such credit, an execution against the debtor that is
returned unsatisfied at such time, whether or not such a creditor exists; or
(3) a bona fide purchaser of real property, other than fixtures, from the debtor, against whom
applicable law permits such transfer to be perfected, that obtains the status of a bona fide
purchaser and has perfected such transfer at the time of the commencement of the case, whether or
not such a purchaser exists.
(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the
debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law by a
creditor holding an unsecured claim that is allowable under section 502 of this title or that is not
allowable only under section 502(e) of this title.
(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a transfer of a charitable contribution (as that term is defined

Any claim by any person to recover a transferred contribution described in the preceding sentence
under Federal or State law in a Federal or State court shall be preempted by the commencement of
the case.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
[Release Point 118-106]
Section 544(a)(3) modifies similar provisions contained in the House bill and Senate amendment so as not
to require a creditor to perform the impossible in order to perfect his interest. Both the lien creditor test in
section 544(a)(1), and the bona fide purchaser test in section 544(a)(3) should not require a transferee to
perfect a transfer against an entity with respect to which applicable law does not permit perfection. The
avoiding powers under section 544(a)(1), (2), and (3) are new. In particular, section 544(a)(1) overrules
Pacific Finance Corp. v. Edwards, 309 F.2d 224 (9th Cir. 1962), and In re Federals, Inc., 553 F.2d 509 (6th
Cir. 1977), insofar as those cases held that the trustee did not have the status of a creditor who extended credit
immediately prior to the commencement of the case.
The House amendment deletes section 544(c) of the House bill.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) is the "strong arm clause" of current law, now found in Bankruptcy Act §70c [section 110(c)
of former title 11]. It gives the trustee the rights of a creditor on a simple contract with a judicial lien on the
property of the debtor as of the date of the petition; of a creditor with a writ of execution against the property
of the debtor unsatisfied as of the date of the petition; and a bona fide purchaser of the real property of the
debtor as of the date of the petition. "Simple contract" as used here is derived from Bankruptcy Act §60a(4)
[section 96(a)(4) of former title 11]. The third status, that of a bona fide purchaser of real property, is new.
Subsection (b) is derived from current section 70e [section 110(e) of former title 11]. It gives the trustee the
rights of actual unsecured creditors under applicable law to void transfers. It follows Moore v. Bay, 284 U.S. 4
(1931), and overrules those cases that hold section 70e gives the trustee the rights of secured creditors.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 545 of the House amendment modifies similar provisions contained in the House bill and Senate
amendment to make clear that a statutory lien may be avoided under section 545 only to the extent the lien
violates the perfection standards of section 545. Thus a Federal tax lien is invalid under section 545(2) with
respect to property specified in sections 6323(b) and (c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 [title 26]. As a
result of this modification, section 545(b) of the Senate amendment is deleted as unnecessary.
Statutory liens: The House amendment retains the provision of section 545(2) of the House bill giving the
trustee in a bankruptcy case the same power which a bona fide purchaser has to take over certain kinds of
personal property despite the existence of a tax lien covering that property. The amendment thus retains
present law, and deletes section 545(b) of the Senate amendment which would have no longer allowed the
trustee to step into the shoes of a bona fide purchaser for this purpose.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section permits the trustee to avoid the fixing of certain statutory liens. It is derived from subsections
67b and 67c of present law [section 107(b) and (c) of former title 11]. Liens that first become effective on the
bankruptcy or insolvency of the debtor are voidable by the trustee. Liens that are not perfected or enforceable
on the date of the petition against a bona fide purchaser are voidable. If a transferee is able to perfect under
section 546(a) and that perfection relates back to an earlier date, then in spite of the filing of the bankruptcy
petition, the trustee would not be able to defeat the lien, because the lien would be perfected and enforceable
against a bona fide purchaser that purchased the property on the date of the filing of the petition. Finally, a lien
for rent or of distress for rent is voidable, whether the lien is a statutory lien or a common law lien of distress
for rent. See proposed 11 U.S.C. 101(37); Bankruptcy Act §67(c)(1)(C). The trustee may avoid a lien under
this section even if the lien has been enforced by sale before the commencement of the case. To that extent,
Bankruptcy Act §67c(5) is not followed.
Subsection (b) limits the trustee's power to avoid tax liens under Federal, state, or local law. For example,
under §6323 of the Internal Revenue Code [Title 26]. Once public notice of a tax lien has been filed, the
Government is generally entitled to priority over subsequent lienholders. However, certain purchasers who
acquire an interest in certain specific kinds of personal property will take free of an existing filed tax lien
attaching to such property. Among the specific kinds of personal property which a purchaser can acquire free
of an existing tax lien (unless the buyer knows of the existence of the lien) are stocks and securities, motor
vehicles, inventory, and certain household goods. Under the present Bankruptcy Act (§67(c)(1)) [section
107(c)(1) of former title 11], the trustee may be viewed as a bona fide purchaser, so that he can take over any
such designated items free of tax liens even if the tax authority has perfected its lien. However, the reasons for
enabling a bona fide purchaser to take these kinds of assets free of an unfiled tax lien, that is, to encourage
free movement of these assets in general commerce, do not apply to a trustee in a title 11 case, who is not in
the same position as an ordinary bona fide purchaser as to such property. The bill accordingly adds a new
[Release Point 118-106]
subsection (b) to sec. 545 providing, in effect, that a trustee in bankruptcy does not have the right under this
section to take otherwise specially treated items of personal property free of a tax lien filed before the filing of
the petition.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 546(a) of the House amendment is derived from section 546(c) of the Senate amendment. Section
546(c) of the House amendment is derived from section 546(b) of the Senate amendment. It applies to receipt
of goods on credit as well as by cash sales. The section clarifies that a demand for reclamation must be made
in writing anytime before 10 days after receipt of the goods by the debtor. The section also permits the court
to grant the reclaiming creditor a lien or an administrative expense in lieu of turning over the property.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
The trustee's rights and powers under certain of the avoiding powers are limited by section 546. First, if an
interest holder against whom the trustee would have rights still has, under applicable nonbankruptcy law, and
as of the date of the petition, the opportunity to perfect his lien against an intervening interest holder, then he
may perfect his interest against the trustee. If applicable law requires seizure for perfection, then perfection is
by notice to the trustee instead. The rights granted to a creditor under this subsection prevail over the trustee
only if the transferee has perfected the transfer in accordance with applicable law, and that perfection relates
back to a date that is before the commencement of the case.
The phrase "generally applicable law" relates to those provisions of applicable law that apply both in
bankruptcy cases and outside of bankruptcy cases. For example, many State laws, under the Uniform
Commercial Code, permit perfection of a purchase-money security interest to relate back to defeat an earlier
levy by another creditor if the former was perfected within ten days of delivery of the property. U.C.C.
§9–301(2). Such perfection would then be able to defeat an intervening hypothetical judicial lien creditor on
the date of the filing of the petition. The purpose of the subsection is to protect, in spite of the surprise
intervention of a bankruptcy petition, those whom State law protects by allowing them to perfect their liens or
interests as of an effective date that is earlier than the date of perfection. It is not designed to give the States an
opportunity to enact disguised priorities in the form of liens that apply only in bankruptcy cases.
Subsection (b) [enacted as (c)] specifies that the trustee's rights and powers under the strong arm clause, the
successor to creditors provision, the preference section, and the postpetition transaction section are all subject
to any statutory or common-law right of a seller, in the ordinary course of business, of goods to the debtor to
reclaim the goods if the debtor received the goods on credit while insolvent. The seller must demand
reclamation within ten days after receipt of the goods by the debtor. As under nonbankruptcy law, the right is
[Release Point 118-106]
subject to any superior rights of secured creditors. The purpose of the provision is to recognize, in part, the
validity of section 2–702 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which has generated much litigation, confusion,
and divergent decisions in different circuits. The right is subject, however, to the power of the court to deny
reclamation and protect the seller by granting him a priority as an administrative expense for his claim arising
out of the sale of the goods.
Subsection (c) [enacted as (a)] adds a statute of limitations to the use by the trustee of the avoiding powers.
The limitation is two years after his appointment, or the time the case is closed or dismissed, whichever occurs
later.

(3) For the purposes of this section, a transfer is not made until the debtor has acquired rights in

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
No limitation is provided for payments to commodity brokers as in section 766 of the Senate amendment
other than the amendment to section 548 of title 11. Section 547(c)(2) protects most payments.
Section 547(b)(2) of the House amendment adopts a provision contained in the House bill and rejects an
alternative contained in the Senate amendment relating to the avoidance of a preferential transfer that is
payment of a tax claim owing to a governmental unit. As provided, section 106(c) of the House amendment
overrules contrary language in the House report with the result that the Government is subject to avoidance of
preferential transfers.
Contrary to language contained in the House report, payment of a debt by means of a check is equivalent to
a cash payment, unless the check is dishonored. Payment is considered to be made when the check is delivered
for purposes of sections 547(c)(1) and (2).
Section 547(c)(6) of the House bill is deleted and is treated in a different fashion in section 553 of the
House amendment.
Section 547(c)(6) represents a modification of a similar provision contained in the House bill and Senate
amendment. The exception relating to satisfaction of a statutory lien is deleted. The exception for a lien
created under title 11 is deleted since such a lien is a statutory lien that will not be avoidable in a subsequent
bankruptcy.
Section 547(e)(1)(B) is adopted from the House bill and Senate amendment without change. It is intended
that the simple contract test used in this section will be applied as under section 544(a)(1) not to require a
creditor to perfect against a creditor on a simple contract in the event applicable law makes such perfection
impossible. For example, a purchaser from a debtor at an improperly noticed bulk sale may take subject to the
rights of a creditor on a simple contract of the debtor for 1 year after the bulk sale. Since the purchaser cannot
perfect against such a creditor on a simple contract, he should not be held responsible for failing to do the
impossible. In the event the debtor goes into bankruptcy within a short time after the bulk sale, the trustee
should not be able to use the avoiding powers under section 544(a)(1) or 547 merely because State law has
made some transfers of personal property subject to the rights of a creditor on a simple contract to acquire a
judicial lien with no opportunity to perfect against such a creditor.
Preferences: The House amendment deletes from the category of transfers on account of antecedent debts
which may be avoided under the preference rules, section 547(b)(2), the exception in the Senate amendment
for taxes owed to governmental authorities. However, for purposes of the "ordinary course" exception to the
preference rules contained in section 547(c)(2), the House amendment specifies that the 45-day period
referred to in section 547(c)(2)(B) is to begin running, in the case of taxes from the last due date, including
extensions, of the return with respect to which the tax payment was made.
[Release Point 118-106]
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section is a substantial modification of present law. It modernizes the preference provisions and brings
them more into conformity with commercial practice and the Uniform Commercial Code.
Subsection (a) contains three definitions. Inventory, new value, and receivable are defined in their ordinary
senses, but are defined to avoid any confusion or uncertainty surrounding the terms.
Subsection (b) is the operative provision of the section. It authorizes the trustee to avoid a transfer if five
conditions are met. These are the five elements of a preference action. First, the transfer must be to or for the
benefit of a creditor. Second, the transfer must be for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor
before the transfer was made. Third, the transfer must have been made when the debtor was insolvent. Fourth,
the transfer must have been made during the 90 days immediately preceding the commencement of the case. If
the transfer was to an insider, the trustee may avoid the transfer if it was made during the period that begins
one year before the filing of the petition and ends 90 days before the filing, if the insider to whom the transfer
was made had reasonable cause to believe the debtor was insolvent at the time the transfer was made.
Finally, the transfer must enable the creditor to whom or for whose benefit it was made to receive a greater
percentage of his claim than he would receive under the distributive provisions of the bankruptcy code.
Specifically, the creditor must receive more than he would if the case were a liquidation case, if the transfer
had not been made, and if the creditor received payment of the debt to the extent provided by the provisions of
the code.
The phrasing of the final element changes the application of the greater percentage test from that employed
under current law. Under this language, the court must focus on the relative distribution between classes as
well as the amount that will be received by the members of the class of which the creditor is a member. The
language also requires the court to focus on the allowability of the claim for which the preference was made.
If the claim would have been entirely disallowed, for example, then the test of paragraph (5) will be met,
because the creditor would have received nothing under the distributive provisions of the bankruptcy code.
The trustee may avoid a transfer of a lien under this section even if the lien has been enforced by sale before
the commencement of the case,
Subsection (b)(2) of this section in effect exempts from the preference rules payments by the debtor of tax
liabilities, regardless of their priority status.
Subsection (c) contains exceptions to the trustee's avoiding power. If a creditor can qualify under any one of
the exceptions, then he is protected to that extent. If he can qualify under several, he is protected by each to
the extent that he can qualify under each.
The first exception is for a transfer that was intended by all parties to be a contemporaneous exchange for
new value, and was in fact substantially contemporaneous. Normally, a check is a credit transaction. However,
for the purposes of this paragraph, a transfer involving a check is considered to be "intended to be
contemporaneous", and if the check is presented for payment in the normal course of affairs, which the
Uniform Commercial Code specifies as 30 days, U.C.C. §3–503(2)(a), that will amount to a transfer that is "in
fact substantially contemporaneous."
The second exception protects transfers in the ordinary course of business (or of financial affairs, where a
business is not involved) transfers. For the case of a consumer, the paragraph uses the phrase "financial
affairs" to include such nonbusiness activities as payment of monthly utility bills. If the debt on account of
which the transfer was made was incurred in the ordinary course of both the debtor and the transferee, if the
transfer was made not later than 45 days after the debt was incurred, if the transfer itself was made in the
ordinary course of both the debtor and the transferee, and if the transfer was made according to ordinary
business terms, then the transfer is protected. The purpose of this exception is to leave undisturbed normal
financial relations, because it does not detract from the general policy of the preference section to discourage
unusual action by either the debtor or his creditors during the debtor's slide into bankruptcy.
The third exception is for enabling loans in connection with which the debtor acquires the property that the
loan enabled him to purchase after the loan is actually made.
The fourth exception codifies the net result rule in section 60c of current law [section 96(c) of former title
11]. If the creditor and the debtor have more than one exchange during the 90-day period, the exchanges are
netted out according to the formula in paragraph (4). Any new value that the creditor advances must be
unsecured in order for it to qualify under this exception.
Paragraph (5) codifies the improvement in position test, and thereby overrules such cases as DuBay v.
Williams, 417 F.2d 1277 (C.A.9, 1966), and Grain Merchants of Indiana, Inc. v. Union Bank and Savings Co.,
408 F.2d 209 (C.A.7, 1969). A creditor with a security interest in a floating mass, such as inventory or
accounts receivable, is subject to preference attack to the extent he improves his position during the 90-day
[Release Point 118-106]
period before bankruptcy. The test is a two-point test, and requires determination of the secured creditor's
position 90 days before the petition and on the date of the petition. If new value was first given after 90 days
before the case, the date on which it was first given substitutes for the 90-day point.
Paragraph (6) excepts statutory liens validated under section 545 from preference attack. It also protects
transfers in satisfaction of such liens, and the fixing of a lien under section 365(j), which protects a vendee
whose contract to purchase real property from the debtor is rejected.
Subsection (d), derived from section 67a of the Bankruptcy Act [section 107(a) of former title 11], permits
the trustee to avoid a transfer to reimburse a surety that posts a bond to dissolve a judicial lien that would have
been avoidable under this section. The second sentence protects the surety from double liability.
Subsection (e) determines when a transfer is made for the purposes of the preference section. Paragraph (1)
defines when a transfer is perfected. For real property, a transfer is perfected when it is valid against a bona
fide purchaser. For personal property and fixtures, a transfer is perfected when it is valid against a creditor on
a simple contract that obtains a judicial lien after the transfer is perfected. "Simple contract" as used here is
derived from Bankruptcy Act §60a(4) [section 96(a)(4) of former title 11]. Paragraph (2) specifies that a
transfer is made when it takes effect between the transferor and the transferee if it is perfected at or within 10
days after that time. Otherwise, it is made when the transfer is perfected. If it is not perfected before the
commencement of the case, it is made immediately before the commencement of the case. Paragraph (3)
specifies that a transfer is not made until the debtor has acquired rights in the property transferred. This
provision, more than any other in the section, overrules DuBay and Grain Merchants, and in combination with
subsection (b)(2), overrules In re King-Porter Co., 446 F.2d 722 (5th Cir. 1971).
Subsection (e) is designed to reach the different results under the 1962 version of Article 9 of the U.C.C.
and under the 1972 version because different actions are required under each version in order to make a
security agreement effective between the parties.
Subsection (f) creates a presumption of insolvency for the 90 days preceding the bankruptcy case. The
presumption is as defined in Rule 301 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, made applicable in bankruptcy cases
by sections 224 and 225 of the bill. The presumption requires the party against whom the presumption exists
to come forward with some evidence to rebut the presumption, but the burden of proof remains on the party in
whose favor the presumption exists.

§548. Fraudulent transfers and obligations
(a)(1) The trustee may avoid any transfer (including any transfer to or for the benefit of an insider
under an employment contract) of an interest of the debtor in property, or any obligation (including
any obligation to or for the benefit of an insider under an employment contract) incurred by the
debtor, that was made or incurred on or within 2 years before the date of the filing of the petition, if
the debtor voluntarily or involuntarily—
(A) made such transfer or incurred such obligation with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud
any entity to which the debtor was or became, on or after the date that such transfer was made or
such obligation was incurred, indebted; or
(B)(i) received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or
obligation; and
(ii)(I) was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, or
became insolvent as a result of such transfer or obligation;
(II) was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a
transaction, for which any property remaining with the debtor was an unreasonably small capital;
(III) intended to incur, or believed that the debtor would incur, debts that would be beyond the
debtor's ability to pay as such debts matured; or
(IV) made such transfer to or for the benefit of an insider, or incurred such obligation to or for
the benefit of an insider, under an employment contract and not in the ordinary course of business.
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) A transfer of a charitable contribution to a qualified religious or charitable entity or
organization shall not be considered to be a transfer covered under paragraph (1)(B) in any case in
which—
(A) the amount of that contribution does not exceed 15 percent of the gross annual income of
the debtor for the year in which the transfer of the contribution is made; or
(B) the contribution made by a debtor exceeded the percentage amount of gross annual income
specified in subparagraph (A), if the transfer was consistent with the practices of the debtor in
making charitable contributions.
(b) The trustee of a partnership debtor may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in
property, or any obligation incurred by the debtor, that was made or incurred on or within 2 years
before the date of the filing of the petition, to a general partner in the debtor, if the debtor was
insolvent on the date such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, or became insolvent as
a result of such transfer or obligation.
(c) Except to the extent that a transfer or obligation voidable under this section is voidable under
section 544, 545, or 547 of this title, a transferee or obligee of such a transfer or obligation that takes
for value and in good faith has a lien on or may retain any interest transferred or may enforce any
obligation incurred, as the case may be, to the extent that such transferee or obligee gave value to the
debtor in exchange for such transfer or obligation.
(d)(1) For the purposes of this section, a transfer is made when such transfer is so perfected that a
bona fide purchaser from the debtor against whom applicable law permits such transfer to be
perfected cannot acquire an interest in the property transferred that is superior to the interest in such
property of the transferee, but if such transfer is not so perfected before the commencement of the
case, such transfer is made immediately before the date of the filing of the petition.
(2) In this section—
(A) "value" means property, or satisfaction or securing of a present or antecedent debt of the
debtor, but does not include an unperformed promise to furnish support to the debtor or to a
relative of the debtor;
(B) a commodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, financial
participant, or securities clearing agency that receives a margin payment, as defined in section
101, 741, or 761 of this title, or settlement payment, as defined in section 101 or 741 of this title,
takes for value to the extent of such payment;
(C) a repo participant or financial participant that receives a margin payment, as defined in
section 741 or 761 of this title, or settlement payment, as defined in section 741 of this title, in
connection with a repurchase agreement, takes for value to the extent of such payment;
(D) a swap participant or financial participant that receives a transfer in connection with a swap
agreement takes for value to the extent of such transfer; and
(E) a master netting agreement participant that receives a transfer in connection with a master
netting agreement or any individual contract covered thereby takes for value to the extent of such
transfer, except that, with respect to a transfer under any individual contract covered thereby, to
the extent that such master netting agreement participant otherwise did not take (or is otherwise
not deemed to have taken) such transfer for value.
(3) In this section, the term "charitable contribution" means a charitable contribution, as that term
is defined in section 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, if that contribution—
(A) is made by a natural person; and
(B) consists of—
(i) a financial instrument (as that term is defined in section 731(c)(2)(C) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986); or
(ii) cash.
(4) In this section, the term "qualified religious or charitable entity or organization" means—
[Release Point 118-106]
(A) an entity described in section 170(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or
(B) an entity or organization described in section 170(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of

(e)(1) In addition to any transfer that the trustee may otherwise avoid, the trustee may avoid any
transfer of an interest of the debtor in property that was made on or within 10 years before the date of
the filing of the petition, if—
(A) such transfer was made to a self-settled trust or similar device;
(B) such transfer was by the debtor;
(C) the debtor is a beneficiary of such trust or similar device; and
(D) the debtor made such transfer with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to
which the debtor was or became, on or after the date that such transfer was made, indebted.
(2) For the purposes of this subsection, a transfer includes a transfer made in anticipation of any
money judgment, settlement, civil penalty, equitable order, or criminal fine incurred by, or which the
debtor believed would be incurred by—
(A) any violation of the securities laws (as defined in section 3(a)(47) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(47))), any State securities laws, or any regulation or
order issued under Federal securities laws or State securities laws; or
(B) fraud, deceit, or manipulation in a fiduciary capacity or in connection with the purchase or
sale of any security registered under section 12 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 548(d)(2) is modified to reflect general application of a provision contained in section 766 of the
Senate amendment with respect to commodity brokers. In particular, section 548(d)(2)(B) of the House
amendment makes clear that a commodity broker who receives a margin payment is considered to receive the
margin payment in return for "value" for purposes of section 548.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section is derived in large part from section 67d of the Bankruptcy Act [section 107(d) of former title
11]. It permits the trustee to avoid transfers by the debtor in fraud of his creditors. Its history dates from the
statute of 13 Eliz. c. 5 (1570).
The trustee may avoid fraudulent transfers or obligations if made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or
defraud a past or future creditor. Transfers made for less than a reasonably equivalent consideration are also
vulnerable if the debtor was or thereby becomes insolvent, was engaged in business with an unreasonably
small capital, or intended to incur debts that would be beyond his ability to repay.
The trustee of a partnership debtor may avoid any transfer of partnership property to a partner in the debtor
if the debtor was or thereby became insolvent.
If a transferee's only liability to the trustee is under this section, and if he takes for value and in good faith,
then subsection (c) grants him a lien on the property transferred, or other similar protection.
Subsection (d) specifies that for the purposes of fraudulent transfer section, a transfer is made when it is
valid against a subsequent bona fide purchaser. If not made before the commencement of the case, it is
considered made immediately before then. Subsection (d) also defines "value" to mean property, or the
satisfaction or securing of a present or antecedent debt, but does not include an unperformed promise to
furnish support to the debtor or a relative of the debtor.

This section modifies section 70d of current law [section 110(d) of former title 11]. It permits the trustee to
avoid transfers of property that occur after the commencement of the case. The transfer must either have been
unauthorized, or authorized under a section that protects only the transferor. Subsection (b) protects
"involuntary gap" transferees to the extent of any value (including services, but not including satisfaction of a
debt that arose before the commencement of the case), given after commencement in exchange for the
transfer. Notice or knowledge of the transferee is irrelevant in determining whether he is protected under this
provision.

a judicial sale, of real property located other than in the county in which the case is commenced, unless a copy
of the petition was filed in the office where conveyances of real property in such county are recorded before
such transfer was so far perfected that a bona fide purchaser of such property against whom applicable law
permits such transfer to be perfected cannot acquire an interest that is superior to the interest of such good
faith or judicial sale purchaser. A good faith purchaser, without knowledge of the commencement of the case
and for less than present fair equivalent value, of real property located other than in the county in which the

(b) The trustee may not recover under section 1 (a)(2) of this section from—

any profit realized by or accruing to such transferee from such property; and
(B) any increase in the value of such property as a result of such improvement, of the property
transferred.
(2) In this subsection, "improvement" includes—
(A) physical additions or changes to the property transferred;
(B) repairs to such property;
(C) payment of any tax on such property;
(D) payment of any debt secured by a lien on such property that is superior or equal to the rights

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 550(a)(1) of the House amendment has been modified in order to permit recovery from an entity for
whose benefit an avoided transfer is made in addition to a recovery from the initial transferee of the transfer.
Section 550(c) would still apply, and the trustee is entitled only to a single satisfaction. The liability of a
transferee under section 550(a) applies only "to the extent that a transfer is avoided". This means that liability
[Release Point 118-106]
is not imposed on a transferee to the extent that a transferee is protected under a provision such as section
548(c) which grants a good faith transferee for value of a transfer that is avoided only as a fraudulent transfer,
a lien on the property transferred to the extent of value given.
Section 550(b) of the House amendment is modified to indicate that value includes satisfaction or securing
of a present antecedent debt. This means that the trustee may not recover under subsection (a)(2) from a
subsequent transferee that takes for "value", provided the subsequent transferee also takes in good faith and
without knowledge of the transfer avoided.
Section 550(e) of the House amendment is derived from section 550(e) of the Senate amendment.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 550 prescribes the liability of a transferee of an avoided transfer, and enunciates the separation
between the concepts of avoiding a transfer and recovering from the transferee. Subsection (a) permits the
trustee to recover from the initial transferee of an avoided transfer or from any immediate or mediate
transferee of the initial transferee. The words "to the extent that" in the lead in to this subsection are designed
to incorporate the protection of transferees found in proposed 11 U.S.C. 549(b) and 548(c). Subsection (b)
limits the liability of an immediate or mediate transferee of the initial transferee if such secondary transferee
takes for value, in good faith and without knowledge of the voidability of the transfer. An immediate or
mediate good faith transferee of a protected secondary transferee is also shielded from liability. This
subsection is limited to the trustee's right to recover from subsequent transferees under subsection (a)(2). It
does not limit the trustee's rights against the initial transferee under subsection (a)(1). The phrase "good faith"
in this paragraph is intended to prevent a transferee from whom the trustee could recover from transferring the
recoverable property to an innocent transferee, and receiving a retransfer from him, that is, "washing" the
transaction through an innocent third party. In order for the transferee to be excepted from liability under this
paragraph, he himself must be a good faith transferee. Subsection (c) is a further limitation on recovery. It
specifies that the trustee is entitled to only one satisfactory, under subsection (a), even if more than one
transferee is liable.
Subsection (d) protects good faith transferees, either initial or subsequent, to the extent of the lesser of the
cost of any improvement the transferee makes in the transferred property and the increase in value of the
property as a result of the improvement. Paragraph (2) of the subsection defines improvement to include
physical additions or changes to the property, repairs, payment of taxes on the property, payment of a debt
secured by a lien on the property, discharge of a lien on the property, and preservation of the property.
Subsection (e) establishes a statute of limitations on avoidance by the Trustee. The limitation is one year
after the avoidance of the transfer or the time the case is closed or dismissed, whichever is earlier.

(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2602.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 551 is adopted from the House bill and the alternative in the Senate amendment is rejected. The
section is clarified to indicate that a transfer avoided or a lien that is void is preserved for the benefit of the
estate, but only with respect to property of the estate. This prevents the trustee from asserting an avoided tax
lien against after acquired property of the debtor.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section is a change from present law. It specifies that any avoided transfer is automatically preserved
for the benefit of the estate. Under current law, the court must determine whether or not the transfer should be
preserved. The operation of the section is automatic, unlike current law, even though preservation may not
benefit the estate in every instance. A preserved lien may be abandoned by the trustee under proposed 11
U.S.C. 554 if the preservation does not benefit the estate. The section as a whole prevents junior lienors from
improving their position at the expense of the estate when a senior lien is avoided.
§552. Postpetition effect of security interest
(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, property acquired by the estate or by the
debtor after the commencement of the case is not subject to any lien resulting from any security
agreement entered into by the debtor before the commencement of the case.
(b)(1) Except as provided in sections 363, 506(c), 522, 544, 545, 547, and 548 of this title, if the
debtor and an entity entered into a security agreement before the commencement of the case and if
the security interest created by such security agreement extends to property of the debtor acquired
before the commencement of the case and to proceeds, products, offspring, or profits of such
property, then such security interest extends to such proceeds, products, offspring, or profits acquired
by the estate after the commencement of the case to the extent provided by such security agreement
and by applicable nonbankruptcy law, except to any extent that the court, after notice and a hearing
and based on the equities of the case, orders otherwise.
(2) Except as provided in sections 363, 506(c), 522, 544, 545, 547, and 548 of this title, and
notwithstanding section 546(b) of this title, if the debtor and an entity entered into a security
agreement before the commencement of the case and if the security interest created by such security
agreement extends to property of the debtor acquired before the commencement of the case and to
amounts paid as rents of such property or the fees, charges, accounts, or other payments for the use
or occupancy of rooms and other public facilities in hotels, motels, or other lodging properties, then
such security interest extends to such rents and such fees, charges, accounts, or other payments
acquired by the estate after the commencement of the case to the extent provided in such security
agreement, except to any extent that the court, after notice and a hearing and based on the equities of
the case, orders otherwise.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 552(a) is derived from the House bill and the alternative provision in the Senate amendment is
rejected. Section 552(b) represents a compromise between the House bill and the Senate amendment. Proceeds
coverage, but not after acquired property clauses, are valid under title 11. The provision allows the court to
consider the equities in each case. In the course of such consideration the court may evaluate any expenditures
by the estate relating to proceeds and any related improvement in position of the secured party. Although this
section grants a secured party a security interest in proceeds, product, offspring, rents, or profits, the section is
explicitly subject to other sections of title 11. For example, the trustee or debtor in possession may use, sell, or
lease proceeds, product, offspring, rents or profits under section 363.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Under the Uniform Commercial Code, article 9, creditors may take security interests in after-acquired
property. Section 552 governs the effect of such a prepetition security interest in postpetition property. It
applies to all security interests as defined in section 101(37) of the bankruptcy code, not only to U.C.C.
security interests.
As a general rule, if a security agreement is entered into before the commencement of the case, then
property that the estate acquires is not subject to the security interest created by a provision in the security
agreement extending the security interest to after-acquired property. Subsection (b) provides an important
exception consistent with the Uniform Commercial Code. If the security agreement extends to proceeds,
product, offspring, rents, or profits of the property in question, then the proceeds would continue to be subject
to the security interest pursuant to the terms of the security agreement and provisions of applicable law, except
to the extent that where the estate acquires the proceeds at the expense of other creditors holding unsecured
claims, the expenditure resulted in an improvement in the position of the secured party.
The exception covers the situation where raw materials, for example, are converted into inventory, or
inventory into accounts, at some expense to the estate, thus depleting the fund available for general unsecured
creditors, but is limited to the benefit inuring to the secured party thereby. Situations in which the estate incurs
expense in simply protecting collateral are governed by 11 U.S.C. 506(c). In ordinary circumstances, the risk
of loss in continued operations will remain with the estate.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Under the Uniform Commercial Code, Article 9, creditors may take security interests in after-acquired
property. This section governs the effect of such a prepetition security interest in postpetition property. It
applies to all security interests as defined in section 101 of the bankruptcy code, not only to U.C.C. security
interests.
As a general rule, if a security agreement is entered into before the case, then property that the estate
acquires is not subject to the security interest created by the security agreement. Subsection (b) provides the
only exception. If the security agreement extends to proceeds, product, offspring, rents, or profits of property
that the debtor had before the commencement of the case, then the proceeds, etc., continue to be subject to the
security interest, except to the extent that the estate acquired the proceeds to the prejudice of other creditors
holding unsecured claims. "Extends to" as used here would include an automatically arising security interest
in proceeds, as permitted under the 1972 version of the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as an interest in
proceeds specifically designated, as required under the 1962 Code or similar statutes covering property not
covered by the Code. "Prejudice" is not intended to be a broad term here, but is designed to cover the situation
where the estate expends funds that result in an increase in the value of collateral. The exception is to cover
the situation where raw materials, for example, are converted into inventory, or inventory into accounts, at
some expense to the estate, thus depleting the fund available for general unsecured creditors. The term
"proceeds" is not limited to the technical definition of that term in the U.C.C., but covers any property into
which property subject to the security interest is converted.

(A) after the commencement of the case; or
(B)(i) after 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition; and

offsets a mutual debt owing to the debtor against a claim against the debtor on or within 90 days
before the date of the filing of the petition, then the trustee may recover from such creditor the
amount so offset to the extent that any insufficiency on the date of such setoff is less than the
insufficiency on the later of—
(A) 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition; and
(B) the first date during the 90 days immediately preceding the date of the filing of the petition
on which there is an insufficiency.
(2) In this subsection, "insufficiency" means amount, if any, by which a claim against the debtor
exceeds a mutual debt owing to the debtor by the holder of such claim.
(c) For the purposes of this section, the debtor is presumed to have been insolvent on and during
the 90 days immediately preceding the date of the filing of the petition.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 553 of the House amendment is derived from a similar provision contained in the Senate
amendment, but is modified to clarify application of a two-point test with respect to setoffs.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section preserves, with some changes, the right of setoff in bankruptcy cases now found in section 68
of the Bankruptcy Act [section 108 of former title 11]. One exception to the right is the automatic stay,
discussed in connection with proposed 11 U.S.C. 362. Another is the right of the trustee to use property under
section 363 that is subject to a right of setoff.
The section states that the right of setoff is unaffected by the bankruptcy code except to the extent that the
creditor's claim is disallowed, the creditor acquired (other than from the debtor) the claim during the 90 days
preceding the case while the debtor was insolvent, the debt being offset was incurred for the purpose of
obtaining a right of setoff, while the debtor was insolvent and during the 90-day prebankruptcy period, or the
creditor improved his position in the 90-day period (similar to the improvement in position test found in the
preference section 547(c)(5)). Only the last exception is an addition to current law.
As under section 547(f), the debtor is presumed to have been insolvent during the 90 days before the case.

periods as are otherwise applicable for such procedures and by establishing, by order, a timetable
having a duration of not to exceed 120 days for the completion of the applicable procedure specified
in subsection (d) of this section. Such time periods and such timetable may be modified by the court,
for cause, in accordance with subsection (f) of this section.

(ii) must be turned over to the estate; or
(iii) may be used, sold, or leased; and
(G) any other request for determination of an interest in such grain or the proceeds of grain;

interests in such grain or the proceeds of grain, by way of—
(A) sale of such grain;
(B) abandonment;
(C) distribution; or
(D) such other method as is equitable in the case;
(3) subject to sections 701, 702, 703, 1104, 1183, 1202, and 1302 of this title, the appointment
of a trustee or examiner and the retention and compensation of any professional person required to
assist with respect to matters relevant to the determination of interests in or disposition of such
grain or the proceeds of grain; and
(4) the determination of any dispute concerning a matter specified in paragraph (1), (2), or (3)
of this subsection.
(e)(1) Any governmental unit that has regulatory jurisdiction over the operation or liquidation of
the debtor or the debtor's business shall be given notice of any request made or order entered under
subsection (c) of this section.

disposition of grain in the possession, custody, or control of the debtor or the estate.
(f) The court may extend the period for final disposition of grain or the proceeds of grain under
this section beyond 120 days if the court finds that—
(1) the interests of justice so require in light of the complexity of the case; and
(2) the interests of those claimants entitled to distribution of grain or the proceeds of grain will
not be materially injured by such additional delay.
(g) Unless an order establishing an expedited procedure under subsection (c) of this section, or
determining any interest in or approving any disposition of grain or the proceeds of grain, is stayed
pending appeal—
(1) the reversal or modification of such order on appeal does not affect the validity of any
procedure, determination, or disposition that occurs before such reversal or modification, whether
or not any entity knew of the pendency of the appeal; and
(2) neither the court nor the trustee may delay, due to the appeal of such order, any proceeding

other costs or expenses.

section include the value, as of the date of disposition, of any grain that the trustee distributes in
kind.
[Release Point 118-106]

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
The House amendment deletes section 701(d) of the Senate amendment. It is anticipated that the Rules of
Bankruptcy Procedure will require the appointment of an interim trustee at the earliest practical moment in
commodity broker bankruptcies, but no later than noon of the day after the date of the filing of the petition,
due to the volatility of such cases.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section requires the court to appoint an interim trustee. The appointment must be made from the panel
of private trustees established and maintained by the Director of the Administrative Office under proposed 28
U.S.C. 604(e).
Subsection (a) requires the appointment of an interim trustee to be made promptly after the order for relief,
unless a trustee is already serving in the case, such as before a conversion from a reorganization to a
liquidation case.
Subsection (b) specifies that the appointment of an interim trustee expires when the permanent trustee is
elected or designated under section 702.
Subsection (c) makes clear that an interim trustee is a trustee in a case under the bankruptcy code.
Subsection (d) provides that in a commodity broker case where speed is essential the interim trustee must
be appointed by noon of the business day immediately following the order for relief.

and Judicial Procedure.
§702. Election of trustee
(a) A creditor may vote for a candidate for trustee only if such creditor—
(1) holds an allowable, undisputed, fixed, liquidated, unsecured claim of a kind entitled to
distribution under section 726(a)(2), 726(a)(3), 726(a)(4), 752(a), 766(h), or 766(i) of this title;
(2) does not have an interest materially adverse, other than an equity interest that is not
substantial in relation to such creditor's interest as a creditor, to the interest of creditors entitled to
such distribution; and
(3) is not an insider.
(b) At the meeting of creditors held under section 341 of this title, creditors may elect one person
to serve as trustee in the case if election of a trustee is requested by creditors that may vote under
subsection (a) of this section, and that hold at least 20 percent in amount of the claims specified in
subsection (a)(1) of this section that are held by creditors that may vote under subsection (a) of this
section.
(c) A candidate for trustee is elected trustee if—
(1) creditors holding at least 20 percent in amount of the claims of a kind specified in subsection
[Release Point 118-106]
(a)(1) of this section that are held by creditors that may vote under subsection (a) of this section
vote; and
(2) such candidate receives the votes of creditors holding a majority in amount of claims
specified in subsection (a)(1) of this section that are held by creditors that vote for a trustee.
(d) If a trustee is not elected under this section, then the interim trustee shall serve as trustee in the
case.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
The House amendment adopts section 702(a)(2) of the Senate amendment. An insubstantial equity interest
does not disqualify a creditor from voting for a candidate for trustee.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) of this section specifies which creditors may vote for a trustee. Only a creditor that holds an
allowable, undisputed, fixed, liquidated, unsecured claim that is not entitled to priority, that does not have an
interest materially adverse to the interest of general unsecured creditors, and that is not an insider may vote for
a trustee. The phrase "materially adverse" is currently used in the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, rule 207(d).
The application of the standard requires a balancing of various factors, such as the nature of the adversity. A
creditor with a very small equity position would not be excluded from voting solely because he holds a small
equity in the debtor. The Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure also currently provide for temporary allowance of
claims, and will continue to do so for the purposes of determining who is eligible to vote under this provision.
Subsection (b) permits creditors at the meeting of creditors to elect one person to serve as trustee in the
case. Creditors holding at least 20 percent in amount of the claims specified in the preceding paragraph must
request election before creditors may elect a trustee. Subsection (c) specifies that a candidate for trustee is
elected trustee if creditors holding at least 20 percent in amount of those claims actually vote, and if the
candidate receives a majority in amount of votes actually cast.
Subsection (d) specifies that if a trustee is not elected, then the interim trustee becomes the permanent
trustee and serves in the case permanently.

§703. Successor trustee
(a) If a trustee dies or resigns during a case, fails to qualify under section 322 of this title, or is
removed under section 324 of this title, creditors may elect, in the manner specified in section 702 of
this title, a person to fill the vacancy in the office of trustee.
(b) Pending election of a trustee under subsection (a) of this section, if necessary to preserve or

(c) If creditors do not elect a successor trustee under subsection (a) of this section or if a trustee is
needed in a case reopened under section 350 of this title, then the United States trustee—
(1) shall appoint one disinterested person that is a member of the panel of private trustees
established under section 586(a)(1) of title 28 to serve as trustee in the case; or
(2) may, if none of the disinterested members of such panel is willing to serve as trustee, serve
as trustee in the case.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
If the office of trustee becomes vacant during the case, this section makes provision for the selection of a
successor trustee. The office might become vacant through death, resignation, removal, failure to qualify
under section 322 by posting bond, or the reopening of a case. If it does, creditors may elect a successor in the
same manner as they may elect a trustee under the previous section. Pending the election of a successor, the
court may appoint an interim trustee in the usual manner if necessary to preserve or prevent loss to the estate.
If creditors do not elect a successor, or if a trustee is needed in a reopened case, then the court appoints a
disinterested member of the panel of private trustees to serve.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 704(8) of the Senate amendment is deleted in the House amendment. Trustees should give
constructive notice of the commencement of the case in the manner specified under section 549(c) of title 11.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
The essential duties of the trustee are enumerated in this section. Others, or elaborations on these, may be
prescribed by the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure to the extent not inconsistent with those prescribed by this
section. The duties are derived from section 47a of the Bankruptcy Act [section 75(a) of former title 11].
The trustee's principal duty is to collect and reduce to money the property of the estate for which he serves,
and to close up the estate as expeditiously as is compatible with the best interests of parties in interest. He
must be accountable for all property received, and must investigate the financial affairs of the debtor. If a
purpose would be served (such as if there are assets that will be distributed), the trustee is required to examine
proofs of claims and object to the allowance of any claim that is improper. If advisable, the trustee must
oppose the discharge of the debtor, which is for the benefit of general unsecured creditors whom the trustee
represents.
The trustee is responsible to furnish such information concerning the estate and its administration as is
requested by a party in interest. If the business of the debtor is authorized to be operated, then the trustee is
required to file with governmental units charged with the responsibility for collection or determination of any
tax arising out of the operation of the business periodic reports and summaries of the operation, including a
statement of receipts and disbursements, and such other information as the court requires. He is required to
give constructive notice of the commencement of the case in the manner specified under section 342(b).

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 706(a) of the House amendment adopts a provision contained in the Senate amendment indicating
that a waiver of the right to convert a case under section 706(a) is unenforceable. The explicit reference in title
11 forbidding the waiver of certain rights is not intended to imply that other rights, such as the right to file a
voluntary bankruptcy case under section 301, may be waived.
Section 706 of the House amendment adopts a similar provision contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the
House. Competing proposals contained in section 706(c) and section 706(d) of the Senate amendment are
rejected.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) of this section gives the debtor the one-time absolute right of conversion of a liquidation case
to a reorganization or individual repayment plan case. If the case has already once been converted from
chapter 11 or 13 to chapter 7, then the debtor does not have that right. The policy of the provision is that the
debtor should always be given the opportunity to repay his debts, and a waiver of the right to convert a case is
unenforceable.
Subsection (b) permits the court, on request of a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, to convert
the case to chapter 11 at any time. The decision whether to convert is left in the sound discretion of the court,
based on what will most inure to the benefit of all parties in interest.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subsection (c) is part of the prohibition against involuntary chapter 13 cases, and prohibits the court from
converting a case to chapter 13 without the debtor's consent.
Subsection (d) reinforces section 109 by prohibiting conversion to a chapter unless the debtor is eligible to
be a debtor under that chapter.

§707. Dismissal of a case or conversion to a case under chapter 11 or 13
(a) The court may dismiss a case under this chapter only after notice and a hearing and only for
cause, including—
(1) unreasonable delay by the debtor that is prejudicial to creditors;
(2) nonpayment of any fees or charges required under chapter 123 of title 28; and
(3) failure of the debtor in a voluntary case to file, within fifteen days or such additional time as
the court may allow after the filing of the petition commencing such case, the information required
by paragraph (1) of section 521(a), but only on a motion by the United States trustee.
(b)(1) After notice and a hearing, the court, on its own motion or on a motion by the United States
trustee, trustee (or bankruptcy administrator, if any), or any party in interest, may dismiss a case filed
by an individual debtor under this chapter whose debts are primarily consumer debts, or, with the
debtor's consent, convert such a case to a case under chapter 11 or 13 of this title, if it finds that the
granting of relief would be an abuse of the provisions of this chapter. In making a determination
whether to dismiss a case under this section, the court may not take into consideration whether a
debtor has made, or continues to make, charitable contributions (that meet the definition of
"charitable contribution" under section 548(d)(3)) to any qualified religious or charitable entity or
organization (as that term is defined in section 548(d)(4)).
(2)(A)(i) In considering under paragraph (1) whether the granting of relief would be an abuse of
the provisions of this chapter, the court shall presume abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly
income reduced by the amounts determined under clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv), and multiplied by 60 is
not less than the lesser of—
[Release Point 118-106]
(I) 25 percent of the debtor's nonpriority unsecured claims in the case, or $6,000,1 whichever is
greater; or
(II) $10,000.1
(ii)(I) The debtor's monthly expenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts
specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, and the debtor's actual monthly
expenses for the categories specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the Internal Revenue
Service for the area in which the debtor resides, as in effect on the date of the order for relief, for the
debtor, the dependents of the debtor, and the spouse of the debtor in a joint case, if the spouse is not
otherwise a dependent. Such expenses shall include reasonably necessary health insurance, disability
insurance, and health savings account expenses for the debtor, the spouse of the debtor, or the
dependents of the debtor. Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the monthly expenses
of the debtor shall not include any payments for debts. In addition, the debtor's monthly expenses
shall include the debtor's reasonably necessary expenses incurred to maintain the safety of the debtor
and the family of the debtor from family violence as identified under section 302 of the Family
Violence Prevention and Services Act, or other applicable Federal law. The expenses included in the
debtor's monthly expenses described in the preceding sentence shall be kept confidential by the
court. In addition, if it is demonstrated that it is reasonable and necessary, the debtor's monthly
expenses may also include an additional allowance for food and clothing of up to 5 percent of the
food and clothing categories as specified by the National Standards issued by the Internal Revenue
Service.
(II) In addition, the debtor's monthly expenses may include, if applicable, the continuation of
actual expenses paid by the debtor that are reasonable and necessary for care and support of an
elderly, chronically ill, or disabled household member or member of the debtor's immediate family
(including parents, grandparents, siblings, children, and grandchildren of the debtor, the dependents
of the debtor, and the spouse of the debtor in a joint case who is not a dependent) and who is unable
to pay for such reasonable and necessary expenses. Such monthly expenses may include, if
applicable, contributions to an account of a qualified ABLE program to the extent such contributions
are not excess contributions (as described in section 4973(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986)
and if the designated beneficiary of such account is a child, stepchild, grandchild, or stepgrandchild
of the debtor.
(III) In addition, for a debtor eligible for chapter 13, the debtor's monthly expenses may include
the actual administrative expenses of administering a chapter 13 plan for the district in which the
debtor resides, up to an amount of 10 percent of the projected plan payments, as determined under
schedules issued by the Executive Office for United States Trustees.
(IV) In addition, the debtor's monthly expenses may include the actual expenses for each
dependent child less than 18 years of age, not to exceed $1,500 1 per year per child, to attend a
private or public elementary or secondary school if the debtor provides documentation of such
expenses and a detailed explanation of why such expenses are reasonable and necessary, and why
such expenses are not already accounted for in the National Standards, Local Standards, or Other
Necessary Expenses referred to in subclause (I).
(V) In addition, the debtor's monthly expenses may include an allowance for housing and utilities,
in excess of the allowance specified by the Local Standards for housing and utilities issued by the
Internal Revenue Service, based on the actual expenses for home energy costs if the debtor provides
documentation of such actual expenses and demonstrates that such actual expenses are reasonable
and necessary.
(iii) The debtor's average monthly payments on account of secured debts shall be calculated as the
sum of—
(I) the total of all amounts scheduled as contractually due to secured creditors in each month of
the 60 months following the date of the filing of the petition; and
(II) any additional payments to secured creditors necessary for the debtor, in filing a plan under
chapter 13 of this title, to maintain possession of the debtor's primary residence, motor vehicle, or
other property necessary for the support of the debtor and the debtor's dependents, that serves as
[Release Point 118-106]
collateral for secured debts;
divided by 60.
(iv) The debtor's expenses for payment of all priority claims (including priority child support and
alimony claims) shall be calculated as the total amount of debts entitled to priority, divided by 60.
(B)(i) In any proceeding brought under this subsection, the presumption of abuse may only be
rebutted by demonstrating special circumstances, such as a serious medical condition or a call or
order to active duty in the Armed Forces, to the extent such special circumstances that justify
additional expenses or adjustments of current monthly income for which there is no reasonable
alternative.
(ii) In order to establish special circumstances, the debtor shall be required to itemize each
additional expense or adjustment of income and to provide—
(I) documentation for such expense or adjustment to income; and
(II) a detailed explanation of the special circumstances that make such expenses or adjustment
to income necessary and reasonable.
(iii) The debtor shall attest under oath to the accuracy of any information provided to demonstrate
that additional expenses or adjustments to income are required.
(iv) The presumption of abuse may only be rebutted if the additional expenses or adjustments to
income referred to in clause (i) cause the product of the debtor's current monthly income reduced by
the amounts determined under clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of subparagraph (A) when multiplied by 60
to be less than the lesser of—
(I) 25 percent of the debtor's nonpriority unsecured claims, or $6,000,1 whichever is greater; or
(II) $10,000.1
(C) As part of the schedule of current income and expenditures required under section 521, the
debtor shall include a statement of the debtor's current monthly income, and the calculations that
determine whether a presumption arises under subparagraph (A)(i), that show how each such amount
is calculated.
(D) Subparagraphs (A) through (C) shall not apply, and the court may not dismiss or convert a
case based on any form of means testing—
(i) if the debtor is a disabled veteran (as defined in section 3741(1) of title 38), and the
indebtedness occurred primarily during a period during which he or she was—
(I) on active duty (as defined in section 101(d)(1) of title 10); or
(II) performing a homeland defense activity (as defined in section 901(1) of title 32); or
(ii) with respect to the debtor, while the debtor is—
(I) on, and during the 540-day period beginning immediately after the debtor is released
from, a period of active duty (as defined in section 101(d)(1) of title 10) of not less than 90
days; or
(II) performing, and during the 540-day period beginning immediately after the debtor is no
longer performing, a homeland defense activity (as defined in section 901(1) of title 32)
performed for a period of not less than 90 days;
if after September 11, 2001, the debtor while a member of a reserve component of the Armed
Forces or a member of the National Guard, was called to such active duty or performed such
homeland defense activity.
(3) In considering under paragraph (1) whether the granting of relief would be an abuse of the
provisions of this chapter in a case in which the presumption in paragraph (2)(A)(i) does not arise or
is rebutted, the court shall consider—
(A) whether the debtor filed the petition in bad faith; or
(B) the totality of the circumstances (including whether the debtor seeks to reject a personal
services contract and the financial need for such rejection as sought by the debtor) of the debtor's
[Release Point 118-106]
financial situation demonstrates abuse.
(4)(A) The court, on its own initiative or on the motion of a party in interest, in accordance with
the procedures described in rule 9011 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, may order the
attorney for the debtor to reimburse the trustee for all reasonable costs in prosecuting a motion filed
under section 707(b), including reasonable attorneys' fees, if—
(i) a trustee files a motion for dismissal or conversion under this subsection; and
(ii) the court—
(I) grants such motion; and
(II) finds that the action of the attorney for the debtor in filing a case under this chapter
violated rule 9011 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.
(B) If the court finds that the attorney for the debtor violated rule 9011 of the Federal Rules of
Bankruptcy Procedure, the court, on its own initiative or on the motion of a party in interest, in
accordance with such procedures, may order—
(i) the assessment of an appropriate civil penalty against the attorney for the debtor; and
(ii) the payment of such civil penalty to the trustee, the United States trustee (or the bankruptcy
administrator, if any).
(C) The signature of an attorney on a petition, pleading, or written motion shall constitute a
certification that the attorney has—
(i) performed a reasonable investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to the petition,
pleading, or written motion; and
(ii) determined that the petition, pleading, or written motion—
(I) is well grounded in fact; and
(II) is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or
reversal of existing law and does not constitute an abuse under paragraph (1).
(D) The signature of an attorney on the petition shall constitute a certification that the attorney has
no knowledge after an inquiry that the information in the schedules filed with such petition is
incorrect.
(5)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) and subject to paragraph (6), the court, on its own
initiative or on the motion of a party in interest, in accordance with the procedures described in rule
9011 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, may award a debtor all reasonable costs
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) in contesting a motion filed by a party in interest (other than a
trustee or United States trustee (or bankruptcy administrator, if any)) under this subsection if—
(i) the court does not grant the motion; and
(ii) the court finds that—
(I) the position of the party that filed the motion violated rule 9011 of the Federal Rules of
Bankruptcy Procedure; or
(II) the attorney (if any) who filed the motion did not comply with the requirements of
clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (4)(C), and the motion was made solely for the purpose of
coercing a debtor into waiving a right guaranteed to the debtor under this title.
(B) A small business that has a claim of an aggregate amount less than $1,000 1 shall not be
subject to subparagraph (A)(ii)(I).
(C) For purposes of this paragraph—
(i) the term "small business" means an unincorporated business, partnership, corporation,
association, or organization that—
(I) has fewer than 25 full-time employees as determined on the date on which the motion is
filed; and
(II) is engaged in commercial or business activity; and
[Release Point 118-106]
(ii) the number of employees of a wholly owned subsidiary of a corporation includes the
employees of—
(I) a parent corporation; and
(II) any other subsidiary corporation of the parent corporation.
(6) Only the judge or United States trustee (or bankruptcy administrator, if any) may file a motion
under section 707(b), if the current monthly income of the debtor, or in a joint case, the debtor and
the debtor's spouse, as of the date of the order for relief, when multiplied by 12, is equal to or less
than—
(A) in the case of a debtor in a household of 1 person, the median family income of the
applicable State for 1 earner;
(B) in the case of a debtor in a household of 2, 3, or 4 individuals, the highest median family
income of the applicable State for a family of the same number or fewer individuals; or

income of the applicable State for a family of 4 or fewer individuals, plus $525 1 per month for
each individual in excess of 4.
(7)(A) No judge, United States trustee (or bankruptcy administrator, if any), trustee, or other party
in interest may file a motion under paragraph (2) if the current monthly income of the debtor,
including a veteran (as that term is defined in section 101 of title 38), and the debtor's spouse
combined, as of the date of the order for relief when multiplied by 12, is equal to or less than—
(i) in the case of a debtor in a household of 1 person, the median family income of the
applicable State for 1 earner;
(ii) in the case of a debtor in a household of 2, 3, or 4 individuals, the highest median family
income of the applicable State for a family of the same number or fewer individuals; or
(iii) in the case of a debtor in a household exceeding 4 individuals, the highest median family
income of the applicable State for a family of 4 or fewer individuals, plus $525 1 per month for
each individual in excess of 4.
(B) In a case that is not a joint case, current monthly income of the debtor's spouse shall not be
considered for purposes of subparagraph (A) if—
(i)(I) the debtor and the debtor's spouse are separated under applicable nonbankruptcy law; or
(II) the debtor and the debtor's spouse are living separate and apart, other than for the purpose of
evading subparagraph (A); and
(ii) the debtor files a statement under penalty of perjury—
(I) specifying that the debtor meets the requirement of subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i); and
(II) disclosing the aggregate, or best estimate of the aggregate, amount of any cash or money
payments received from the debtor's spouse attributed to the debtor's current monthly income.
(c)(1) In this subsection—

victim of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime, may when it is in the best interest of the
victim dismiss a voluntary case filed under this chapter by a debtor who is an individual if such
individual was convicted of such crime.
(3) The court may not dismiss a case under paragraph (2) if the debtor establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the filing of a case under this chapter is necessary to satisfy a
claim for a domestic support obligation.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 707 of the House amendment indicates that the court may dismiss a case only after notice and a
hearing.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section authorizes the court to dismiss a liquidation case only for cause, such as unreasonable delay by
the debtor that is prejudicial to creditors or nonpayment of any fees and charges required under chapter 123
[§1911 et seq.] of title 28. These causes are not exhaustive, but merely illustrative. The section does not
contemplate, however, that the ability of the debtor to repay his debts in whole or in part constitutes adequate
cause for dismissal. To permit dismissal on that ground would be to enact a non-uniform mandatory chapter
13, in lieu of the remedy of bankruptcy.

SUBCHAPTER II—COLLECTION, LIQUIDATION, AND DISTRIBUTION
OF THE ESTATE
§721. Authorization to operate business
The court may authorize the trustee to operate the business of the debtor for a limited period, if
such operation is in the best interest of the estate and consistent with the orderly liquidation of the
[Release Point 118-106]
estate.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2606.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section is derived from section 2a(5) of the Bankruptcy Act [section 11(a)(5) of former title 11]. It
permits the court to authorize the operation of any business of the debtor for a limited period, if the operation
is in the best interest of the estate and consistent with orderly liquidation of the estate. An example is the
operation of a watch company to convert watch movements and cases into completed watches which will
bring much higher prices than the component parts would have brought.
§722. Redemption
An individual debtor may, whether or not the debtor has waived the right to redeem under this
section, redeem tangible personal property intended primarily for personal, family, or household use,
from a lien securing a dischargeable consumer debt, if such property is exempted under section 522
of this title or has been abandoned under section 554 of this title, by paying the holder of such lien
the amount of the allowed secured claim of such holder that is secured by such lien in full at the time
of redemption.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2606; Pub. L. 109–8, title III, §304(2), Apr. 20, 2005, 119

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 722 of the House amendment adopts the position taken in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and
rejects the alternative contained in section 722 of the Senate amendment.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section is new and is broader than rights of redemption under the Uniform Commercial Code. It
authorizes an individual debtor to redeem tangible personal property intended primarily for personal, family,
or household use, from a lien securing a nonpurchase money dischargeable consumer debt. It applies only if
the debtor's interest in the property is exempt or has been abandoned.
This right to redeem is a very substantial change from current law. To prevent abuses such as may occur
when the debtor deliberately allows the property to depreciate in value, the debtor will be required to pay the
fair market value of the goods or the amount of the claim if the claim is less. The right is personal to the
debtor and not assignable.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
This section is new and is broader than rights of redemption under the Uniform Commercial Code. It
authorizes an individual debtor to redeem tangible personal property intended primarily for personal, family,
or household use, from a lien securing a dischargeable consumer debt. It applies only if the debtor's interest in
the property is exempt or has been abandoned.
The right to redeem extends to the whole of the property, not just the debtor's exempt interest in it. Thus, for
example, if a debtor owned a $2,000 car, subject to a $1,200 lien, the debtor could exempt his $800 interest in
the car. The debtor is permitted a $1,500 exemption in a car, proposed 11 U.S.C. 522(d)(2). This section
permits him to pay the holder of the lien $1,200 and redeem the entire car, not just the remaining $700 of his
exemption. The redemption is accomplished by paying the holder of the lien the amount of the allowed claim
secured by the lien. The provision amounts to a right of first refusal for the debtor in consumer goods that
might otherwise be repossessed. The right of redemption under this section is not waivable.

§723. Rights of partnership trustee against general partners
(a) If there is a deficiency of property of the estate to pay in full all claims which are allowed in a
case under this chapter concerning a partnership and with respect to which a general partner of the
partnership is personally liable, the trustee shall have a claim against such general partner to the
extent that under applicable nonbankruptcy law such general partner is personally liable for such
deficiency.
(b) To the extent practicable, the trustee shall first seek recovery of such deficiency from any
general partner in such partnership that is not a debtor in a case under this title. Pending
determination of such deficiency, the court may order any such partner to provide the estate with
indemnity for, or assurance of payment of, any deficiency recoverable from such partner, or not to
dispose of property.
(c) The trustee has a claim against the estate of each general partner in such partnership that is a
debtor in a case under this title for the full amount of all claims of creditors allowed in the case
concerning such partnership. Notwithstanding section 502 of this title, there shall not be allowed in
such partner's case a claim against such partner on which both such partner and such partnership are
liable, except to any extent that such claim is secured only by property of such partner and not by
property of such partnership. The claim of the trustee under this subsection is entitled to distribution
in such partner's case under section 726(a) of this title the same as any other claim of a kind specified
in such section.
(d) If the aggregate that the trustee recovers from the estates of general partners under subsection
(c) of this section is greater than any deficiency not recovered under subsection (b) of this section,
the court, after notice and a hearing, shall determine an equitable distribution of the surplus so
recovered, and the trustee shall distribute such surplus to the estates of the general partners in such
partnership according to such determination.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 723(c) of the House amendment is a compromise between similar provisions contained in the
House bill and Senate amendment. The section makes clear that the trustee of a partnership has a claim against
each general partner for the full amount of all claims of creditors allowed in the case concerning the
partnership. By restricting the trustee's rights to claims of "creditors," the trustee of the partnership will not
have a claim against the general partners for administrative expenses or claims allowed in the case concerning
the partnership. As under present law, sections of the Bankruptcy Act [former title 11] applying to codebtors
and sureties apply to the relationship of a partner with respect to a partnership debtor. See sections 501(b),
502(e), 506(d)(2), 509, 524(d), and 1301 of title 11.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section is a significant departure from present law. It repeals the jingle rule, which, for ease of
administration, denied partnership creditors their rights against general partners by permitting general partners'
individual creditors to share in their estates first to the exclusion of partnership creditors. The result under this
section more closely tracks generally applicable partnership law, without a significant administrative burden.
Subsection (a) specifies that each general partner in a partnership debtor is liable to the partnership's trustee
for any deficiency of partnership property to pay in full all administrative expenses and all claims against the
[Release Point 118-106]
partnership.
Subsection (b) requires the trustee to seek recovery of the deficiency from any general partner that is not a
debtor in a bankruptcy case. The court is empowered to order that partner to indemnify the estate or not to
dispose of property pending a determination of the deficiency. The language of the subsection is directed to
cases under the bankruptcy code. However, if, during the early stages of the transition period, a partner in a
partnership is proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act [former title 11] while the partnership is proceeding under
the bankruptcy code, the trustee should not first seek recovery against the Bankruptcy Act partner. Rather, the
Bankruptcy Act partner should be deemed for the purposes of this section and the rights of the trustee to be
proceeding under title 11.
Subsection (c) requires the partnership trustee to seek recovery of the full amount of the deficiency from the
estate of each general partner that is a debtor in a bankruptcy case. The trustee will share equally with the
partners' individual creditors in the assets of the partners' estates. Claims of partnership creditors who may
have filed against the partner will be disallowed to avoid double counting.
Subsection (d) provides for the case where the total recovery from all of the bankrupt general partners is
greater than the deficiency of which the trustee sought recovery. This case would most likely occur for a
partnership with a large number of general partners. If the situation arises, the court is required to determine
an equitable redistribution of the surplus to the estate of the general partners. The determination will be based
on factors such as the relative liability of each of the general partners under the partnership agreement and the
relative rights of each of the general partners in the profits of the enterprise under the partnership agreement.

the extent of the amount of such allowed tax claim that is secured by such tax lien;
(3) third, to the holder of such tax lien, to any extent that such holder's allowed tax claim that is
secured by such tax lien exceeds any amount distributed under paragraph (2) of this subsection;
(4) fourth, to any holder of an allowed claim secured by a lien on such property that is not
avoidable under this title and that is junior to such tax lien;
(5) fifth, to the holder of such tax lien, to the extent that such holder's allowed claim secured by
such tax lien is not paid under paragraph (3) of this subsection; and
(6) sixth, to the estate.
(c) If more than one holder of a claim is entitled to distribution under a particular paragraph of
subsection (b) of this section, distribution to such holders under such paragraph shall be in the same
order as distribution to such holders would have been other than under this section.
(d) A statutory lien the priority of which is determined in the same manner as the priority of a tax
lien under section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be treated under subsection (b) of
this section the same as if such lien were a tax lien.
(e) Before subordinating a tax lien on real or personal property of the estate, the trustee shall—
(1) exhaust the unencumbered assets of the estate; and
(2) in a manner consistent with section 506(c), recover from property securing an allowed
secured claim the reasonable, necessary costs and expenses of preserving or disposing of such
property.
(f) Notwithstanding the exclusion of ad valorem tax liens under this section and subject to the
requirements of subsection (e), the following may be paid from property of the estate which secures
a tax lien, or the proceeds of such property:
(1) Claims for wages, salaries, and commissions that are entitled to priority under section
507(a)(4).
(2) Claims for contributions to an employee benefit plan entitled to priority under section

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 724 of the House amendment adopts the provision taken in the House bill and rejects the provision
taken in the Senate amendment. In effect, a tax claim secured by a lien is treated as a claim between the fifth
and sixth priority in a case under chapter 7 rather than as a secured claim.
Treatment of certain liens: The House amendment modifies present law by requiring the subordination of
tax liens on both real and personal property to the payment of claims having a priority. This means that assets
are to be distributed from the debtor's estate to pay higher priority claims before the tax claims are paid, even
though the tax claims are properly secured. Under present law and the Senate amendment only tax liens on
personal property, but not on real property, are subordinated to the payment of claims having a priority above
the priority for tax claims.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) of section 724 permits the trustee to avoid a lien that secures a fine, penalty, forfeiture, or
multiple, punitive, or exemplary damages claim to the extent that the claim is not compensation for actual
pecuniary loss. The subsection follows the policy found in section 57j of the Bankruptcy Act [section 93(j) of
[Release Point 118-106]
former title 11] of protecting unsecured creditors from the debtor's wrongdoing, but expands the protection
afforded. The lien is made voidable rather than void in chapter 7, in order to permit the lien to be revived if the
case is converted to chapter 11 under which penalty liens are not voidable. To make the lien void would be to
permit the filing of a chapter 7, the voiding of the lien, and the conversion to a chapter 11, simply to avoid a
penalty lien, which should be valid in a reorganization case.
Subsection (b) governs tax liens. This provision retains the rule of present bankruptcy law (§67(C)(3) of the
Bankruptcy Act [section 107(c)(3) of former title 11]) that a tax lien on personal property, if not avoidable by
the trustee, is subordinated in payment to unsecured claims having a higher priority than unsecured tax claims.
Those other claims may be satisfied from the amount that would otherwise have been applied to the tax lien,
and any excess of the amount of the lien is then applied to the tax. Any personal property (or sale proceeds)
remaining is to be used to satisfy claims secured by liens which are junior to the tax lien. Any proceeds
remaining are next applied to pay any unpaid balance of the tax lien.
Subsection (d) specifies that any statutory lien whose priority is determined in the same manner as a tax lien
is to be treated as a tax lien under this section, even if the lien does not secure a claim for taxes. An example is
the ERISA [29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.] lien.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (b) governs tax liens. It is derived from section 67c(3) of the Bankruptcy Act [section 107(c)(3)
of former title 11], without substantial modification in result. It subordinates tax liens to administrative
expense and wage claims, and solves certain circuity of liens problems that arise in connection with the
subordination. The order of distribution of property subject to a tax lien is as follows: First, to holders of liens
senior to the tax lien; second, to administrative expenses, wage claims, and consumer creditors that are
granted priority, but only to the extent of the amount of the allowed tax claim secured by the lien. In other
words, the priority claimants step into the shoes of the tax collector. Third, to the tax claimant, to the extent
that priority claimants did not use up his entire claim. Fourth, to junior lien holders. Fifth, to the tax collector
to the extent that he was not paid under paragraph (3). Finally, any remaining property goes to the estate. The
result of these provisions are to leave senior and junior lienors and holders of unsecured claims undisturbed. If
there are any liens that are equal in status to the tax lien, they share pari passu with the tax lien under the
distribution provisions of this subsection.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 725 of the House amendment adopts the substance contained in both the House bill and Senate
amendment but transfers an administrative function to the trustee in accordance with the general thrust of this
legislation to separate the administrative and the judicial functions where appropriate.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section requires the court to determine the appropriate disposition of property in which the estate and
an entity other than the estate have an interest. It would apply, for example, to property subject to a lien or
property co-owned by the estate and another entity. The court must make the determination with respect to
property that is not disposed of under another section of the bankruptcy code, such as by abandonment under
section 554, by sale or distribution under 363, or by allowing foreclosure by a secured creditor by lifting the
stay under section 362. The purpose of the section is to give the court appropriate authority to ensure that
collateral or its proceeds is returned to the proper secured creditor, that consigned or bailed goods are returned
to the consignor or bailor and so on. Current law is curiously silent on this point, though case law has grown
to fill the void. The section is in lieu of a section that would direct a certain distribution to secured creditors. It
gives the court greater flexibility to meet the circumstances, and it is broader, permitting disposition of
property subject to a co-ownership interest.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 726(a)(4) adopts a provision contained in the Senate amendment subordinating prepetition penalties
and penalties arising in the involuntary gap period to the extent the penalties are not compensation for actual
pecuniary laws.
The House amendment deletes a provision following section 726(a)(6) of the Senate amendment providing
that the term "claim" includes interest due owed before the date of the filing of the petition as unnecessary
since a right to payment for interest due is a right to payment which is within the definition of "claim" in
section 101(4) of the House amendment.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section is the general distribution section for liquidation cases. It dictates the order in which
distribution of property of the estate, which has usually been reduced to money by the trustee under the
requirements of section 704(1).
First, property is distributed among priority claimants, as determined by section 507, and in the order
prescribed by section 507. Second, distribution is to general unsecured creditors. This class excludes priority
creditors and the two classes of subordinated creditors specified below. The provision is written to permit
distribution to creditors that tardily file claims if their tardiness was due to lack of notice or knowledge of the
case. Though it is in the interest of the estate to encourage timely filing, when tardy filing is not the result of a
failure to act by the creditor, the normal subordination penalty should not apply. Third distribution is to
general unsecured creditors who tardily file. Fourth distribution is to holders of fine, penalty, forfeiture, or
multiple, punitive, or exemplary damage claims. More of these claims are disallowed entirely under present
law. They are simply subordinated here.
Paragraph (4) provides that punitive penalties, including prepetition tax penalties, are subordinated to the
payment of all other classes of claims, except claims for interest accruing during the case. In effect, these
penalties are payable out of the estate's assets only if and to the extent that a surplus of assets would otherwise
remain at the close of the case for distribution back to the debtor.
Paragraph (5) provides that postpetition interest on prepetition claims is also to be paid to the creditor in a
subordinated position. Like prepetition penalties, such interest will be paid from the estate only if and to the
extent that a surplus of assets would otherwise remain for return to the debtor at the close of the case.
This section also specifies that interest accrued on all claims (including priority and nonpriority tax claims)
which accrued before the date of the filing of the title 11 petition is to be paid in the same order of distribution
of the estate's assets as the principal amount of the related claims.
[Release Point 118-106]
Any surplus is paid to the debtor under paragraph (6).
Subsection (b) follows current law. It specifies that claims within a particular class are to be paid pro rata.
This provision will apply, of course, only when there are inadequate funds to pay the holders of claims of a
particular class in full. The exception found in the section, which also follows current law, specifies that
liquidation administrative expenses are to be paid ahead of reorganization administrative expenses if the case
has been converted from a reorganization case to a liquidation case, or from an individual repayment plan case
to a liquidation case.
Subsection (c) governs distributions in cases in which there is community property and other property of the
estate. The section requires the two kinds of property to be segregated. The distribution is as follows: First,
administrative expenses are to be paid, as the court determines on any reasonable equitable basis, from both
kinds of property. The court will divide administrative expenses according to such factors as the amount of
each kind of property in the estate, the cost of preservation and liquidation of each kind of property, and
whether any particular administrative expenses are attributable to one kind of property or the other. Second,
claims are to be paid as provided under subsection (a) (the normal liquidation case distribution rules) in the
following order and manner: First, community claims against the debtor or the debtor's spouse are paid from
community property, except such as is liable solely for the debts of the debtor.
Second, community claims against the debtor, to the extent not paid under the first provision, are paid from
community property that is solely liable for the debts of the debtor. Third, community claims, to the extent
they remain unpaid, and all other claims against the debtor, are paid from noncommunity property. Fourth, if
any community claims against the debtor or the debtor's spouse remain unpaid, they are paid from whatever
property remains in the estate. This would occur if community claims against the debtor's spouse are large in
amount and most of the estate's property is property solely liable, under nonbankruptcy law, for debts of the
debtor.
The marshalling rules in this section apply only to property of the estate. However, they will provide a
guide to the courts in the interpretation of proposed 11 U.S.C. 725, relating to distribution of collateral, in
cases in which there is community property. If a secured creditor has a lien on both community and
noncommunity property, the marshalling rules here—by analogy would dictate that the creditor be satisfied
first out of community property, and then out of separate property.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Sections 727(a) (8) and (9) of the House amendment represent a compromise between provisions contained
in section 727(a)(8) of the House bill and Senate amendment. Section 727(a)(8) of the House amendment
adopts section 727(a)(8) of the House bill. However, section 727(a)(9) of the House amendment contains a
compromise based on section 727(a)(8) of the Senate amendment with respect to the circumstances under
which a plan by way of composition under Chapter XIII of the Bankruptcy Act [chapter 13 of former title 11]
should be a bar to discharge in a subsequent proceeding under title 11. The paragraph provides that a
discharge under section 660 or 661 of the Bankruptcy Act [section 1060 or 1061 of former title 11] or section
1328 of title 11 in a case commenced within 6 years before the date of the filing of the petition in a subsequent
case, operates as a bar to discharge unless, first, payments under the plan totaled at least 100 percent of the
allowed unsecured claims in the case; or second, payments under the plan totaled at least 70 percent of the
allowed unsecured claims in the case and the plan was proposed by the debtor in good faith and was the
debtor's best effort.
It is expected that the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure will contain a provision permitting the debtor to
request a determination of whether a plan is the debtor's "best effort" prior to confirmation of a plan in a case
under chapter 13 of title 11. In determining whether a plan is the debtor's "best effort" the court will evaluate
several factors. Different facts and circumstances in cases under chapter 13 operate to make any rule of thumb
of limited usefulness. The court should balance the debtor's assets, including family income, health insurance,
retirement benefits, and other wealth, a sum which is generally determinable, against the foreseeable
necessary living expenses of the debtor and the debtor's dependents, which unfortunately is rarely quantifiable.
In determining the expenses of the debtor and the debtor's dependents, the court should consider the stability
of the debtor's employment, if any, the age of the debtor, the number of the debtor's dependents and their ages,
the condition of equipment and tools necessary to the debtor's employment or to the operation of his business,
and other foreseeable expenses that the debtor will be required to pay during the period of the plan, other than
payments to be made to creditors under the plan.
Section 727(a)(10) of the House amendment clarifies a provision contained in section 727(a)(9) of the
House bill and Senate amendment indicating that a discharge may be barred if the court approves a waiver of
discharge executed in writing by the debtor after the order for relief under chapter 7.
Section 727(b) of the House amendment adopts a similar provision contained in the Senate amendment
modifying the effect of discharge. The provision makes clear that the debtor is discharged from all debts that
arose before the date of the order for relief under chapter 7 in addition to any debt which is determined under
section 502 as if it were a prepetition claim. Thus, if a case is converted from chapter 11 or chapter 13 to a
case under chapter 7, all debts prior to the time of conversion are discharged, in addition to debts determined
after the date of conversion of a kind specified in section 502, that are to be determined as prepetition claims.
This modification is particularly important with respect to an individual debtor who files a petition under
chapter 11 or chapter 13 of title 11 if the case is converted to chapter 7. The logical result of the House
amendment is to equate the result that obtains whether the case is converted from another chapter to chapter 7,
or whether the other chapter proceeding is dismissed and a new case is commenced by filing a petition under
chapter 7.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section is the heart of the fresh start provisions of the bankruptcy law. Subsection (a) requires the court
to grant a debtor a discharge unless one of nine conditions is met. The first condition is that the debtor is not
an individual. This is a change from present law, under which corporations and partnerships may be
discharged in liquidation cases, though they rarely are. The change in policy will avoid trafficking in corporate
shells and in bankrupt partnerships. "Individual" includes a deceased individual, so that if the debtor dies
[Release Point 118-106]
during the bankruptcy case, he will nevertheless be released from his debts, and his estate will not be liable for
them. Creditors will be entitled to only one satisfaction—from the bankruptcy estate and not from the probate
estate.
The next three grounds for denial of discharge center on the debtor's wrongdoing in or in connection with
the bankruptcy case. They are derived from Bankruptcy Act §14c [section 32(c) of former title 11]. If the
debtor, with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors or an officer of the estate, has transferred,
removed, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed, or has permitted any such action with respect to, property of the
debtor within the year preceding the case, or property of the estate after the commencement of the case, then
the debtor is denied discharge. The debtor is also denied discharge if he has concealed, destroyed, mutilated,
falsified, or failed to keep or preserve any books and records from which his financial condition might be
ascertained, unless the act or failure to act was justified under all the circumstances of the case. The fourth
ground for denial of discharge is the commission of a bankruptcy crime, although the standard of proof is
preponderance of the evidence rather than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. These crimes include the making
of a false oath or account, the use or presentation of a false claim, the giving or receiving of money for acting
or forbearing to act, and the withholding from an officer of the estate entitled to possession of books and
records relating to the debtor's financial affairs.
The fifth ground for denial of discharge is the failure of the debtor to explain satisfactorily any loss of assets
or deficiency of assets to meet the debtor's liabilities. The sixth ground concerns refusal to testify. It is a
change from present law, under which the debtor may be denied discharge for legitimately exercising his right
against self-incrimination. Under this provision, the debtor may be denied discharge if he refuses to obey any
lawful order of the court, or if he refuses to testify after having been granted immunity or after improperly
invoking the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.
The seventh ground for denial of discharge is the commission of an act specified in grounds two through six
during the year before the debtor's case in connection with another bankruptcy case concerning an insider.
The eighth ground for denial of discharge is derived from §14c(5) of the Bankruptcy Act [section 32(c)(5)
of former title 11]. If the debtor has been granted a discharge in a case commenced within 6 years preceding
the present bankruptcy case, he is denied discharge. This provision, which is no change from current law with
respect to straight bankruptcy, is the 6-year bar to discharge. Discharge under chapter 11 will bar a discharge
for 6 years. As under current law, confirmation of a composition wage earner plan under chapter 13 is a basis
for invoking the 6-year bar.
The ninth ground is approval by the court of a waiver of discharge.
Subsection (b) specifies that the discharge granted under this section discharges the debtor from all debts
that arose before the date of the order for relief. It is irrelevant whether or not a proof of claim was filed with
respect to the debt, and whether or not the claim based on the debt was allowed.
Subsection (c) permits the trustee, or a creditor, to object to discharge. It also permits the court, on request
of a party in interest, to order the trustee to examine the acts and conduct of the debtor to determine whether a
ground for denial of discharge exists.
Subsection (d) requires the court to revoke a discharge already granted in certain circumstances. If the
debtor obtained the discharge through fraud, if he acquired and concealed property of the estate, or if he
refused to obey a court order or to testify, the discharge is to be revoked.
Subsection (e) permits the trustee or a creditor to request revocation of a discharge within 1 year after the
discharge is granted, on the grounds of fraud, and within one year of discharge or the date of the closing of the
case, whichever is later, on other grounds.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 741(6) of the House bill and Senate amendment is deleted by the House amendment since the
defined term is used only in section 741(4)(A)(iii). A corresponding change is made in that section.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 741 sets forth definitions for subchapter III of chapter 7.
Paragraph (1) defines "Commission" to mean the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Paragraph (2) defines "customer" to include anybody that interacts with the debtor in a capacity that
concerns securities transactions. The term embraces cash or margin customers of a broker or dealer in the
broadest sense.
Paragraph (3) defines "customer name security" in a restrictive fashion to include only non-transferable
securities that are registered, or in the process of being registered in a customer's own name. The securities
must not be endorsed by the customer and the stockbroker must not be able to legally transfer the securities by
delivery, by a power of attorney, or otherwise.
Paragraph (4) defines "customer property" to include all property of the debtor that has been segregated for
customers or property that should have been segregated but was unlawfully converted. Clause (i) refers to
customer property not properly segregated by the debtor or customer property converted and then recovered
so as to become property of the estate. Unlawfully converted property that has been transferred to a third party
is excluded until it is recovered as property of the estate by virtue of the avoiding powers. The concept
excludes customer name securities that have been delivered to or reclaimed by a customer and any property
properly belonging to the stockholder, such as money deposited by a customer to pay for securities that the
stockholder has distributed to such customer.
Paragraph (5) [enacted as (6)] defines "net equity" to establish the extent to which a customer will be
entitled to share in the single and separate fund. Accounts of a customer are aggregated and offset only to the
extent the accounts are held by the customer in the same capacity. Thus, a personal account is separate from
an account held as trustee. In a community property state an account held for the community is distinct from
an account held as separate property.
The net equity is computed by liquidating all securities positions in the accounts and crediting the account
with any amount due to the customer. Regardless of the actual dates, if any, of liquidation, the customer is
only entitled to the liquidation value at the time of the filing of the petition. To avoid double counting, the
liquidation value of customer name securities belonging to a customer is excluded from net equity. Thus,
clause (ii) includes claims against a customer resulting from the liquidation of a security under clause (i). The
value of a security on which trading has been suspended at the time of the filing of the petition will be
estimated. Once the net liquidation value is computed, any amount that the customer owes to the stockbroker
is subtracted including any amount that would be owing after the hypothetical liquidation, such as brokerage
fees. Debts owed by the customer to the debtor, other than in a securities related transaction, will not reduce
the net equity of the customer. Finally, net equity is increased by any payment by the customer to the debtor
actually paid within 60 days after notice. The principal reason a customer would make such a payment is to
reclaim customer name securities under §751.
[Release Point 118-106]
Paragraph (6) defines "1934 Act" to mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.].
Paragraph (7) [enacted as (9)] defines "SIPC" to mean the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.

LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 742 of the House amendment deletes a sentence contained in the Senate amendment requiring the
trustee in an interstate stock-brokerage liquidation to comply with the provisions of subchapter IV of chapter 7
if the debtor is also a commodity broker. The House amendment expands the requirement to require the SIPC
trustee to perform such duties, if the debtor is a commodity broker, under section 7(b) of the Securities
Investor Protection Act [15 U.S.C. 78ggg(b)]. The requirement is deleted from section 742 since the trustee of
an intrastate stockbroker will be bound by the provisions of subchapter IV of chapter 7 if the debtor is also a
commodity broker by reason of section 103 of title 11.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 742 indicates that the automatic stay does not prevent SIPC from filing an application for a
protective decree under SIPA. If SIPA does file such an application, then all bankruptcy proceedings are
suspended until the SIPC action is completed. If SIPC completes liquidation of the stockbroker then the
bankruptcy case is dismissed.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 745(a) indicates that each account held by a customer in a separate capacity is to be considered a
separate account. This prevents the offset of accounts held in different capacities.
Subsection (b) indicates that a bank or another stockbroker that is a customer of a debtor is considered to
hold its customers accounts in separate capacities. Thus a bank or other stockbroker is not treated as a mutual
fund for purposes of bulk investment. This protects unrelated customers of a bank or other stockholder from
having their accounts offset.
Subsection (c) effects the same result with respect to a trust so that each beneficiary is treated as the
customer of the debtor rather than the trust itself. This eliminates any doubt whether a trustee holds a personal
account in a separate capacity from his trustee's account.

(a) If, after the date of the filing of the petition, an entity enters into a transaction with the debtor,
in a manner that would have made such entity a customer had such transaction occurred before the
date of the filing of the petition, and such transaction was entered into by such entity in good faith
and before the qualification under section 322 of this title of a trustee, such entity shall be deemed a
customer, and the date of such transaction shall be deemed to be the date of the filing of the petition

(b) An entity does not have a claim as a customer to the extent that such entity transferred to the
debtor cash or a security that, by contract, agreement, understanding, or operation of law, is—
(1) part of the capital of the debtor; or
(2) subordinated to the claims of any or all creditors.

Section 746(a) protects entities who deal in good faith with the debtor after the filing of the petition and

section will be in an involuntary case before the order for relief, because §701(b) requires prompt appointment
of an interim trustee after the order for relief.
Subsection (b) indicates that an entity who holds securities that are either part of the capital of the debtor or
that are subordinated to the claims of any creditor of the debtor is not a customer with respect to those
securities. This subsection will apply when the stockbroker has sold securities in itself to the customer or

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 748 requires the trustee to liquidate all securities, except for customer name securities, of the estate
in a manner consistent with good market practice. The trustee should refrain from flooding a thin market with
a large percentage of shares in any one issue. If the trustee holds restricted securities or securities in which
trading has been suspended, then the trustee must arrange to liquidate such securities in accordance with the
securities laws. A private placement may be the only exemption available with the customer of the debtor the
best prospect for such a placement. The subsection does not permit such a customer to bid in his net equity as
part of the purchase price; a contrary result would permit a customer to receive a greater percentage on his net
equity claim than other customers.
§749. Voidable transfers
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any transfer of property that, but for such transfer,
would have been customer property, may be avoided by the trustee, and such property shall be
treated as customer property, if and to the extent that the trustee avoids such transfer under section
544, 545, 547, 548, or 549 of this title. For the purpose of such sections, the property so transferred
shall be deemed to have been property of the debtor and, if such transfer was made to a customer or
for a customer's benefit, such customer shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to have
been a creditor.
(b) Notwithstanding sections 544, 545, 547, 548, and 549 of this title, the trustee may not avoid a
transfer made before seven days after the order for relief if such transfer is approved by the
Commission by rule or order, either before or after such transfer, and if such transfer is—
(1) a transfer of a securities contract entered into or carried by or through the debtor on behalf
of a customer, and of any cash, security, or other property margining or securing such securities
contract; or
(2) the liquidation of a securities contract entered into or carried by or through the debtor on

The trustee may not distribute a security except under section 751 of this title.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 750 forbids the trustee from distributing a security other than a customer name security. The term
"distribution" refers to a distribution to customers in satisfaction of net equity claims and is not intended to
preclude the trustee from liquidating securities under proposed 11 U.S.C. 748.
§751. Customer name securities
The trustee shall deliver any customer name security to or on behalf of the customer entitled to
such security, unless such customer has a negative net equity. With the approval of the trustee, a
customer may reclaim a customer name security after payment to the trustee, within such period as
the trustee allows, of any claim of the debtor against such customer to the extent that such customer
will not have a negative net equity after such payment.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2614.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 751 requires the trustee to deliver a customer name security to the customer entitled to such security
unless the customer has a negative net equity. The customer's net equity will be negative when the amount
owed by the customer to the stockbroker exceeds the liquidation value of the non-customer name securities in
the customer's account. If the customer is a net debtor of the stockbroker, then the trustee may permit the
customer to repay debts to the stockbroker so that the customer will no longer be in debt to the stockbroker. If
the customer refuses to pay such amount, then the court may order the customer to endorse the security in
order that the trustee may liquidate such property.
§752. Customer property
(a) The trustee shall distribute customer property ratably to customers on the basis and to the
extent of such customers' allowed net equity claims and in priority to all other claims, except claims
of the kind specified in section 507(a)(2) of this title that are attributable to the administration of
such customer property.
(b)(1) The trustee shall distribute customer property in excess of that distributed under subsection
[Release Point 118-106]
(a) of this section in accordance with section 726 of this title.
(2) Except as provided in section 510 of this title, if a customer is not paid the full amount of such
customer's allowed net equity claim from customer property, the unpaid portion of such claim is a
claim entitled to distribution under section 726 of this title.
(c) Any cash or security remaining after the liquidation of a security interest created under a
security agreement made by the debtor, excluding property excluded under section 741(4)(B) of this
title, shall be apportioned between the general estate and customer property in the same proportion as
the general estate of the debtor and customer property were subject to such security interest.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2614; Pub. L. 97–222, §15, July 27, 1982, 96 Stat. 238; Pub.

2005, 119 Stat. 216.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 752(a) requires the trustee to distribute customer property to customers based on the amount of their
net equity claims. Customer property is to be distributed in priority to all claims except expenses of
administration entitled to priority under §507(1). It is anticipated that the court will apportion such
administrative claims on an equitable basis between the general estate and the customer property of the debtor.
Subsection (b)(1) indicates that in the event customer property exceeds customers net equity claims and
administrative expenses, the excess pours over into the general estate. This event would occur if the value of
securities increased dramatically after the order for relief but before liquidation by the trustee. Subsection
(b)(2) indicates that the unpaid portion of a customer's net equity claim is entitled to share in the general estate
as an unsecured claim unless subordinated by the court under proposed 11 U.S.C. 501. A net equity claim of a
customer that is subordinated under section 747 is entitled to share in distribution under section 726(a)(2)
unless subordinated under section 510 independently of the subordination under section 747.
Subsection (c) provides for apportionment between customer property and the general estate of any equity
of the debtor in property remaining after a secured creditor liquidates a security interest. This might occur if a
stockbroker hypothecates securities of his own and of his customers if the value of the hypothecated securities
exceeds the debt owed to the secured party. The apportionment is to be made according to the ratio of
customer property and general property of the debtor that comprised the collateral. The subsection refers to
cash and securities of customers to include any customer property unlawfully converted by the stockbroker in
the course of such a transaction. The apportionment is made subject to section 741(4)(B) to insure that
property in a customer's account that is owed to the stockbroker will not be considered customer property.
This recognizes the right of the stockbroker to withdraw money that has been erroneously placed in a
customer's account or that is otherwise owing to the stockbroker.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Subchapter IV of chapter 7 represents a compromise between similar chapters in the House bill and Senate
amendment. Section 761(2) of the House amendment defines "clearing organization" to cover an organization
that clears commodity contracts on a contract market or a board of trade; the expansion of the definition is
intended to include clearing organizations that clear commodity options. Section 761(4) of the House
[Release Point 118-106]
amendment adopts the term "commodity contract" as used in section 761(5) of the Senate amendment but with
the more precise substantive definitions contained in section 761(8) of the House bill. The definition is
modified to insert "board of trade" to cover commodity options. Section 761(5) of the House amendment
adopts the definition contained in section 761(6) of the Senate amendment in preference to the definition
contained in section 761(4) of the House bill which erroneously included onions. Section 761(9) of the House
amendment represents a compromise between similar provisions contained in section 761(10) of the Senate
amendment and section 761(9) of the House bill. The compromise adopts the substance contained in the
House bill and adopts the terminology of "commodity contract" in lieu of "contractual commitment" as
suggested in the Senate amendment. Section 761(10) of the House amendment represents a compromise
between similar sections in the House bill and Senate amendment regarding the definition of "customer
property." The definition of "distribution share" contained in section 761(12) of the Senate amendment is
deleted as unnecessary. Section 761(12) of the House amendment adopts a definition of "foreign futures
commission merchant" similar to the definition contained in section 761(14) of the Senate amendment. The
definition is modified to cover either an entity engaged in soliciting orders or the purchase or sale of a foreign
future, or an entity that accepts cash, a security, or other property for credit in connection with such a
solicitation or acceptance. Section 761(13) of the House amendment adopts a definition of "leverage
transaction" identical to the definition contained in section 761(15) of the Senate amendment. Section 761(15)
of the House amendment adopts the definition of "margin payment" contained in section 761(17) of the Senate
amendment. Section 761(17) of the House amendment adopts a definition of "net equity" derived from section
761(15) of the House bill.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Paragraph (1) defines "Act" to mean the Commodity Exchange Act [7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.].
Paragraph (2) defines "clearing organization" to mean an organization that clears (i.e., matches purchases
and sales) commodity futures contracts made on or subject to the rules of a contract market or commodity
options transactions made on or subject to the rules of a commodity option exchange. Although commodity
option trading on exchanges is currently prohibited, it is anticipated that CFTC may permit such trading in the
future.
Paragraphs (3) and (4) define terms "Commission" and "commodity futures contract".
Paragraph (5) [enacted as (4)] defines "commodity contract" to mean a commodity futures contract
(§761(4)), a commodity option (§761(6)), or a leverage contract (§761(15)).
Paragraph (b) [probably should be "(6)" which was enacted as (5)] defines "commodity option" by
reference to section 4c(b) of the Commodity Exchange Act [7 U.S.C. 6c(b)].
Paragraphs (7), (8), and (9) [enacted as (6), (7), and (8)] define "commodity options dealer," "contract
market," "contract of sale," "commodity," "future delivery," "board of trade," and "futures commission
merchant."
Paragraph (10) [enacted as (9)] defines the term "customer" to mean with respect to a futures commission
merchant or a foreign futures commission merchant, the entity for whom the debtor carries a commodity
futures contract or foreign future, or with whom such a contract is carried (such as another commodity
broker), or from whom the debtor has received, acquired, or holds cash, securities, or other property arising
out of or connected with specified transactions involving commodity futures contracts or foreign futures. This
section also defines "customer" in the context of leverage transaction merchants, clearing organizations, and
commodity options dealers. Persons associated with a commodity broker, such as its employees, officers, or
partners, may be customers under this definition.
The definition of "customer" serves to isolate that class of persons entitled to the protection subchapter IV
provides to customers. In addition, section 101(5) defines "commodity broker" to mean a futures commission
merchant, foreign futures commission merchant, clearing organization, leverage transaction merchant, or
commodity options dealer, with respect to which there is a customer. Accordingly, the definition of customer
also serves to designate those entities which must utilize chapter 7 and are precluded from reorganizing under
chapter 11.
Paragraph (11) [enacted as (10)] defines "customer property" to mean virtually all property or proceeds
thereof, received, acquired, or held by or for the account of the debtor for a customer arising out of or in
connection with a transaction involving a commodity contract.
Paragraph (12) defines "distribution share" to mean the amount to which a customer is entitled under
section 765(a).
Paragraphs (13), (14), (15), and (16) [enacted as (11), (12), (13), and (14)] define "foreign future," "foreign
futures commission merchant," "leverage transaction," and "leverage transaction merchant."
Paragraph (17) [enacted as (15)] defines "margin payment" to mean a payment or deposit commonly known
[Release Point 118-106]
to the commodities trade as original margin, initial margin, or variation margin.
Paragraph (18) [enacted as (16)] defines "member property."
Paragraph (19) [enacted as (17)] defines "net equity" to be the sum of (A) the value of all customer property
remaining in a customer's account immediately after all commodity contracts of such customer have been
transferred, liquidated, or become identified for delivery and all obligations of such customer to the debtor
have been offset (such as margin payments, whether or not called, and brokerage commissions) plus (B) the
value of specifically identifiable customer property previously returned to the customer by the trustee, plus (C)
if the trustee has transferred any commodity contract to which the customer is entitled or any margin or
security for such contract, the value of such contract and margin or security. Net equity, therefore, will be the
total amount of customer property to which a customer is entitled as of the date of the filing of the bankruptcy
petition, although valued at subsequent dates. The Commission is given authority to promulgate rules and
regulations to further refine this definition.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Paragraph (8) [enacted as (4)] is a dynamic definition of "contractual commitment". The definition will vary
depending on the character of the debtor in each case. If the debtor is a futures commission merchant or a
clearing organization, then subparagraphs (A) and (D) indicate that the definition means a contract of sale of a
commodity for future delivery on a contract market. If the debtor is a foreign futures commission merchant, a
leverage transaction merchant, or a commodity options dealer, then subparagraphs (B), (C), and (E) indicate
that the definition means foreign future, leverage transaction, or commodity option, respectively.
Paragraph (9) defines "customer" in a similar style. It is anticipated that a debtor with multifaceted
characteristics will have separate estates for each different kind of customer. Thus, a debtor that is a leverage
transaction merchant and a commodity options dealer would have separate estates for the leverage transaction
customers and for the options customers, and a general estate for other creditors. Customers for each kind of
commodity broker, except the clearing organization, arise from either of two relationships. In subparagraphs
(A), (B), (C), and (E), clause (i) treats with customers to the extent of contractual commitments with the
debtor in either a broker or a dealer relationship. Clause (ii) treats with customers to the extent of proceeds
from contractual commitments or deposits for the purpose of making contractual commitments. The customer
of the clearing organization is a member with a proprietary or customers' account.
Paragraph (10) defines "customer property" to include all property in customer accounts and property that
should have been in those accounts but was diverted through conversion or mistake. Clause (i) refers to
customer property not properly segregated by the debtor or customer property converted and then recovered
so as to become property of the estate. Clause (vii) is intended to exclude property that would cost more to
recover from a third party than the value of the property itself. Subparagraph (B) excludes property in a
customer's account that belongs to the commodity broker, such as a contract placed in the account by error, or
cash due the broker for a margin payment that the broker has made.
Paragraph (15) [enacted as (17)] defines "net equity" to include the value of all contractual commitments at
the time of liquidation or transfer less any obligations owed by the customer to the debtor, such as brokerage
fees. In addition, the term includes the value of any specifically identifiable property as of the date of return to
the customer and the value of any customer property transferred to another commodity broker as of the date of
transfer. This definition places the risk of market fluctuations on the customer until commitments leave the
estate.

Commission by rule or order, either before or after such transfer, and if such transfer is—
(1) a transfer of a commodity contract entered into or carried by or through the debtor on behalf

Section 764 of the House amendment is derived from the House bill.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 764 permits the trustee to void any transfer of property that, except for such transfer, would have
been customer property, to the extent permitted under section 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, or 724(a).
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Section 764 indicates the extent to which the avoiding powers may be used by the trustee under subchapter
IV of chapter 7. If property recovered would have been customer property if never transferred, then subsection
(a) indicates that it will be so treated when recovered.
Subsection (b) prohibits avoiding any transaction that occurs before or within five days after the petition if
the transaction is approved by the Commission and concerns an open contractual commitment. This enables
the Commission to exercise its discretion to protect the integrity of the market by insuring that transactions
cleared with other brokers will not be undone on a preference or a fraudulent transfer theory.
Subsection (c) insulates variation margin payments and other deposits from the avoiding powers except to
the extent of actual fraud under section 548(a)(1). This facilitates prepetition transfers and protects the
ordinary course of business in the market.

§766. Treatment of customer property
(a) The trustee shall answer all margin calls with respect to a specifically identifiable commodity
contract of a customer until such time as the trustee returns or transfers such commodity contract, but
the trustee may not make a margin payment that has the effect of a distribution to such customer of
more than that to which such customer is entitled under subsection (h) or (i) of this section.
(b) The trustee shall prevent any open commodity contract from remaining open after the last day
of trading in such commodity contract, or into the first day on which notice of intent to deliver on
such commodity contract may be tendered, whichever occurs first. With respect to any commodity
contract that has remained open after the last day of trading in such commodity contract or with
respect to which delivery must be made or accepted under the rules of the contract market on which
such commodity contract was made, the trustee may operate the business of the debtor for the
purpose of—
(1) accepting or making tender of notice of intent to deliver the physical commodity underlying
such commodity contract;
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) facilitating delivery of such commodity; or
(3) disposing of such commodity if a party to such commodity contract defaults.
(c) The trustee shall return promptly to a customer any specifically identifiable security, property,
or commodity contract to which such customer is entitled, or shall transfer, on such customer's
behalf, such security, property, or commodity contract to a commodity broker that is not a debtor
under this title, subject to such rules or regulations as the Commission may prescribe, to the extent
that the value of such security, property, or commodity contract does not exceed the amount to which
such customer would be entitled under subsection (h) or (i) of this section if such security, property,
or commodity contract were not returned or transferred under this subsection.
(d) If the value of a specifically identifiable security, property, or commodity contract exceeds the
amount to which the customer of the debtor is entitled under subsection (h) or (i) of this section, then
such customer to whom such security, property, or commodity contract is specifically identified may
deposit cash with the trustee equal to the difference between the value of such security, property, or
commodity contract and such amount, and the trustee then shall—
(1) return promptly such security, property, or commodity contract to such customer; or
(2) transfer, on such customer's behalf, such security, property, or commodity contract to a
commodity broker that is not a debtor under this title, subject to such rules or regulations as the
Commission may prescribe.
(e) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the trustee shall liquidate any commodity contract
that—
(1) is identified to a particular customer and with respect to which such customer has not timely
instructed the trustee as to the desired disposition of such commodity contract;
(2) cannot be transferred under subsection (c) of this section; or
(3) cannot be identified to a particular customer.
(f) As soon as practicable after the commencement of the case, the trustee shall reduce to money,
consistent with good market practice, all securities and other property, other than commodity
contracts, held as property of the estate, except for specifically identifiable securities or property
distributable under subsection (h) or (i) of this section.
(g) The trustee may not distribute a security or other property except under subsection (h) or (i) of
this section.
(h) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the trustee shall distribute customer
property ratably to customers on the basis and to the extent of such customers' allowed net equity
claims, and in priority to all other claims, except claims of a kind specified in section 507(a)(2) of
this title that are attributable to the administration of customer property. Such distribution shall be in
the form of—
(1) cash;
(2) the return or transfer, under subsection (c) or (d) of this section, of specifically identifiable
customer securities, property, or commodity contracts; or
(3) payment of margin calls under subsection (a) of this section.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a customer net equity claim based on a
proprietary account, as defined by Commission rule, regulation, or order, may not be paid either in
whole or in part, directly or indirectly, out of customer property unless all other customer net equity
claims have been paid in full.
(i) If the debtor is a clearing organization, the trustee shall distribute—
(1) customer property, other than member property, ratably to customers on the basis and to the
extent of such customers' allowed net equity claims based on such customers' accounts other than
proprietary accounts, and in priority to all other claims, except claims of a kind specified in section
507(a)(2) of this title that are attributable to the administration of such customer property; and
(2) member property ratably to customers on the basis and to the extent of such customers'
[Release Point 118-106]
allowed net equity claims based on such customers' proprietary accounts, and in priority to all
other claims, except claims of a kind specified in section 507(a)(2) of this title that are attributable
to the administration of member property or customer property.
(j)(1) The trustee shall distribute customer property in excess of that distributed under subsection
(h) or (i) of this section in accordance with section 726 of this title.
(2) Except as provided in section 510 of this title, if a customer is not paid the full amount of such
customer's allowed net equity claim from customer property, the unpaid portion of such claim is a
claim entitled to distribution under section 726 of this title.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Sections 765 and 766 of the House amendment represent a consolidation and redraft of sections 765, 766,
767, and 768 of the House bill and sections 765, 766, 767, and 768 of the Senate amendment. In particular,
section 765(a) of the House amendment is derived from section 765(a) of the House bill and section 767(a) of
the Senate amendment. Under section 765(a) of the House amendment customers are notified of the
opportunity to immediately file proofs of claim and to identify specifically identifiable securities, property, or
commodity contracts. The customer is also afforded an opportunity to instruct the trustee regarding the
customer's desires concerning disposition of the customer's commodity contracts. Section 767(b) [probably
should be 765(b)] makes clear that the trustee must comply with instructions received to the extent
practicable, but in the event the trustee has transferred commodity contracts to a commodity broker, such
instructions shall be forwarded to the broker.
Section 766(a) of the House amendment is derived from section 768(c) of the House bill and section 767(f)
of the Senate amendment. Section 766(b) of the House amendment is derived from section 765(d) of the
House bill, and section 767(g) of the Senate amendment. Section 766(c) of the House amendment is derived
from section 768(a) of the House bill and section 767(e) of the Senate amendment. Section 766(d) of the
House amendment is derived from section 768(b) of the House bill and the second sentence of section 767(e)
of the Senate amendment.
Section 766(e) of the House amendment is derived from section 765(c) of the House bill and sections
767(c) and (d) of the Senate amendment. The provision clarifies that the trustee may liquidate a commodity
contract only if the commodity contract cannot be transferred to a commodity broker under section 766(c),
cannot be identified to a particular customer, or has been identified with respect to a particular customer, but
with respect to which the customer's instructions have not been received.
Section 766(f) of the House amendment is derived from section 766(b) of the House bill and section 767(h)
of the Senate amendment. The term "all securities and other property" is not intended to include a commodity
contract. Section 766(g) of the House amendment is derived from section 766(a) of the House bill. Section
766(h) of the House amendment is derived from section 767(a) of the House bill and section 765(a) of the
Senate amendment. In order to induce private trustees to undertake the difficult and risky job of liquidating a
commodity broker, the House amendment contains a provision insuring that a pro rata share of administrative
claims will be paid. The provision represents a compromise between the position taken in the House bill,
subordinating customer property to all expenses of administration, and the position taken in the Senate
amendment requiring the distribution of customer property in advance of any expenses of administration. The
position in the Senate amendment is rejected since customers, in any event, would have to pay a brokerage
commission or fee in the ordinary course of business. The compromise provision requires customers to pay
only those administrative expenses that are attributable to the administration of customer property.
Section 766(i) of the House amendment is derived from section 767(b) of the House bill and contains a
similar compromise with respect to expenses of administration as the compromise detailed in connection with
section 766(h) of the House amendment. Section 766(j) of the House amendment is derived from section
767(c) of the House bill. No counterpart is contained in the Senate amendment. The provision takes account of
the rare case where the estate has customer property in excess of customer claims and administrative expenses
attributable to those claims. The section also specifies that to the extent a customer is not paid in full out of
customer property, that the unpaid claim will be treated the same as any other general unsecured creditor.
Section 768 of the Senate amendment was deleted from the House amendment as unwise. The provision in
[Release Point 118-106]
the Senate amendment would have permitted the trustee to distribute customer property based upon an
estimate of value of the customer's account, with no provision for recapture of excessive disbursements.
Moreover, the section would have exonerated the trustee from any liability for such an excessive
disbursement. Furthermore, the section is unclear with respect to the customer's rights in the event the trustee
makes a distribution less than the share to which the customer is entitled. The provision is deleted in the
House amendment so that this difficult problem may be handled on a case-by-case basis by the courts as the
facts and circumstances of each case require.
Section 769 of the Senate amendment is deleted in the House amendment as unnecessary. The provision
was intended to codify Board of Trade v. Johnson, 264 U.S. 1 (1924) [Ill.1924, 44 S.Ct. 232]. Board of Trade
against Johnson is codified in section 363(f) of the House amendment which indicates the only five
circumstances in which property may be sold free and clear of an interest in such property of an entity other
than the estate.
Section 770 of the Senate amendment is deleted in the House amendment as unnecessary. That section
would have permitted commodity brokers to liquidate commodity contracts, notwithstanding any contrary
order of the court. It would require an extraordinary circumstance, such as a threat to the national security, to
enjoin a commodity broker from liquidating a commodity contract. However, in those circumstances, an
injunction must prevail. Failure of the House amendment to incorporate section 770 of the Senate amendment
does not imply that the automatic stay prevents liquidation of commodity contracts by commodity brokers. To
the contrary, whenever by contract, or otherwise, a commodity broker is entitled to liquidate a position as a
result of a condition specified in a contract, other than a condition or default of the kind specified in section
365(b)(2) of title 11, the commodity broker may engage in such liquidation. To this extent, the commodity
broker's contract with his customer is treated no differently than any other contract under section 365 of title
11.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
[Section 765] Subsection (a) of this section [enacted as section 766(h)] provides that with respect to
liquidation of commodity brokers which are not clearing organizations, the trustee shall distribute customer
property to customers on the basis and to the extent of such customers' allowed net equity claims, and in
priority to all other claims. This section grants customers' claims first priority in the distribution of the estate.
Subsection (b) [enacted as section 766(i)] grants the same priority to member property and other customer
property in the liquidation of a clearing organization. A fundamental purpose of these provisions is to ensure
that the property entrusted by customers to their brokers will not be subject to the risks of the broker's business
and will be available for disbursement to customers if the broker becomes bankrupt.
As a result of section 765, a customer need not trace any funds in order to avoid treatment as a general
creditor as was required by the Seventh Circuit in In re Rosenbaum Grain Corporation.
Section 766 lists certain transfers which are not voidable by the trustee of a commodity broker. Subsection
(a) exempts transfers approved by the Commission by rule or order, either before or after the transfer. It is
expected that the Commission will use this power sparingly and only when necessary to effectuate the
remedial purposes of this legislation, bearing in mind that the immediate transfer of customer accounts from
bankrupt commodity brokers to solvent commodity brokers is one of the primary goals of this subchapter. The
committee considered and rejected a provision in subsection (b) that would have exempted payments made to
a commodity broker. The Commission may not by rule exempt such transfers. The Commission's prompt
attention to the promulgation of such rules and regulations is expected.
Subsection (b) [enacted as section 764(c)] provides for the nonavoidability of margin payments made by a
commodity broker, other than a clearing organization. If such payments are made by or to a clearing
organization, they are nonavoidable pursuant to subsection (c). All other margin payments made by a
commodity broker, other than a clearing organization, are nonavoidable if they meet the conditions set forth in
subsection (b). Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) parallel the requirements for avoidance of fraudulent transfers
and obligations under section 548. Subsection (b)(3) adds a requirement that there be collusion between the
transferee and transferor in order for such payments to be voidable. It would be unfair to permit recovery from
an innocent commodity broker since such brokers are, for the most part, simply conduits for margin payments
and do not retain margin for use in their operations. Subsection (b)(4) would permit recovery of a subsequent
transferee only if it had actual knowledge at the time of that subsequent transfer of the scheme to defraud.
Again it should be noted that if the transfer is a margin payment and the subsequent transferee is a clearing
organization, the transfer is nonavoidable under section 766(c).
Subsection (c) [enacted as section 548(d)(2)] overrules Seligson v. New York Produce Exchange, and
provides as a matter of law that margin payments made by or to a clearing organization are not voidable.
Section 767 sets forth the procedures to be followed by the trustee. It should be emphasized that many of
[Release Point 118-106]
the duties imposed on the trustee are required to be discharged by the trustee immediately upon his
appointment. The earlier these duties are discharged the less potential market disruption can result.
The initial duty of the trustee is to endeavor to transfer to another commodity broker or brokers all
identified customer accounts together with the customer property margining such accounts, to the extent the
trustee deems appropriate. Although it is preferable for all such accounts to be transferred, exigencies may
dictate a partial transfer. The requirement that the value of the accounts and property transferred not exceed
the customer's distribution share may necessitate a slight delay until the trustee can submit to the court, for its
disapproval, an estimate of each customer's distribution share pursuant to section 768.
Subsection (c) [enacted as section 766(e)] provides that contemporaneously with the estimate of the
distribution share and the transfer of identified customer accounts and property, subsection (c) provides that
the trustee should make arrangements for the liquidation of all commodity contracts maintained by the debtor
that are not identifiable to specific customers. These contracts would, of course, include all such contracts held
in the debtor's proprietory [sic] account.
At approximately the same time, the trustee should notify each customer of the debtor's bankruptcy and
instruct each customer immediately to submit a claim including any claim to a specifically identifiable
security or other property, and advise the trustee as to the desired disposition of commodity contracts carried
by the debtor for the customer.
This requirement is placed upon the trustee to insure that producers who have hedged their production in
the commodities market are allowed the opportunity to preserve their positions. The theory of the commodity
market is that it exists for producers and buyers of commodities and not for the benefit of the speculators
whose transactions now comprise the overwhelming majority of trades. Maintenance of positions by hedges
may require them to put up additional margin payments in the hours and days following the commodity broker
bankruptcy, which they may be unable or unwilling to do. In such cases, their positions will be quickly
liquidated by the trustee, but they must have the opportunity to make those margin payments before they are
summarily liquidated out of the market to the detriment of their growing crop. The failure of the customer to
advise the trustee as to disposition of the customer's commodity contract will not delay a transfer of a contract
pursuant to subsection (b) so long as the contract can otherwise be identified to the customer. Nor will the
failure of the customer to submit a claim prevent the customer from recovering the net equity in that
customer's account, absent a claim the customer cannot participate in the determination of the net equity in the
account.
If the customer submits instructions pursuant to subsection (a) after the customer's commodity contracts are
transferred to another commodity broker, the trustee must transmit the instruction to the transferee. If the
customer's commodity contracts are not transferred before the customer's instructions are received, the trustee
must attempt to comply with the instruction, subject to the provisions of section 767(d).
Under subsection (d) [enacted as section 766(e)], the trustee has discretion to liquidate any commodity
contract carried by the debtor at any time. This discretion must be exercised with restraint in such cases,
consistent with the purposes of this subchapter and good business practices. The committee intends that
hedged accounts will be given special consideration before liquidation as discussed in connection with
subsection (c).
Subsection (e) [enacted as section 766(c)] instructs the trustee as to the disposition of any security or other
property, not disposed of pursuant to subsection (b) or (d), that is specifically identifiable to a customer and to
which the customer is entitled. Such security or other property must be returned to the customer or promptly
transferred to another commodity broker for the benefit of the customer. If the value of the security or other
property retained or transferred, together with any other distribution made by the trustee to or on behalf of the
customer, exceeds the customer's distribution share the customer must deposit cash with the trustee equal to
that difference before the return or transfer of the security or other property.
Subsection (f) [enacted as section 766(a)] requires the trustee to answer margin calls on specifically
identifiable customer commodity contracts, but only to the extent that the margin payment, together with any
other distribution made by the trustee to or on behalf of the customer, does not exceed the customer's
distribution share.
Subsection (g) [enacted as section 766(b)] requires the trustee to liquidate all commodity futures contracts
prior to the close of trading in that contract, or the first day on which notice of intent to deliver on that contract
may be tendered, whichever occurs first. If the customer desires that the contract be kept open for delivery, the
contract should be transferred to another commodity broker pursuant to subsection (b).
If for some reason the trustee is unable to transfer a contract on which delivery must be made or accepted
and is unable to close out such contract, the trustee is authorized to operate the business of the debtor for the
purpose of accepting or making tender of notice of intent to deliver the physical commodity underlying the
contract, facilitating delivery of the physical commodity or disposing of the physical commodity in the event
[Release Point 118-106]
of a default. Any property received, not previously held, by the trustee in connection with its operation of the
business of the debtor for these purposes, is not by the terms of this subchapter specifically included in the
definition of customer property.
Finally, subsection (h) [enacted as section 766(f)] requires the trustee to liquidate the debtor's estate as soon
as practicable and consistent with good market practice, except for specifically identifiable securities or other
property distributable under subsection (e).
Section 768 is an integral part of the commodity broker liquidation procedures outlined in section 767.
Prompt action by the trustee to transfer or liquidate customer commodity contracts is necessary to protect
customers, the debtor's estate, and the marketplace generally. However, transfers of customer accounts and
property valued in excess of the customer's distribution share are prohibited. Since a determination of the
customer's distribution share requires a determination of the customer's net equity and the total dollar value of
customer property held by or for the account of the debtor, it is possible that the customer's distribution share
will not be determined, and thus the customer's contracts and property will not be transferred, on a timely
basis. To avoid this problem, and to expedite transfers of customer property, section 768 permits the trustee to
make distributions to customers in accordance with a preliminary estimate of the debtor's customer property
and each customer's distribution share.
It is acknowledged that the necessity for prompt action may not allow the trustee to assemble all relevant
facts before such an estimate is made. However, the trustee is expected to develop as accurate an estimate as
possible based on the available facts. Further, in order to permit expeditious action, section 768 does not
require that notice be given to customers or other creditors before the court approves or disapproves the
estimate. Nor does section 768 require that customer claims be received pursuant to section 767(a) before the
trustee may act upon and in accordance with the estimate. If the estimate is inaccurate, the trustee is absolved
of liability for a distribution which exceeds the customer's actual distribution share so long as the distribution
did not exceed the customer's estimated distribution share. However, a trustee may have a claim back against a
customer who received more than its actual distribution share.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Section 765(a) indicates that a customer must file a proof of claim, including any claim to specifically
identifiable property, within such time as the court fixes.
Subsection (c) [of section 765 (enacted as section 766(e))] sets forth the general rule requiring the trustee to
liquidate contractual commitments that are either not specifically identifiable or with respect to which a
customer has not instructed the trustee during the time fixed by the court. Subsection (d) [enacted as section
766(b)] indicates an exception to the time limits in the rule by requiring the trustee to liquidate any open
contractual commitment before the last day of trading or the first day during which delivery may be
demanded, whichever first occurs, if transfer cannot be effectuated.
Section 766(a) [enacted as section 766(g)] indicates that the trustee may distribute securities or other
property only under section 768. This does not preclude a distribution of cash under section 767(a) or
distribution of any excess customer property under section 767(c) to the general estate.
Subsection (b) [enacted as section 766(f)] indicates that the trustee shall liquidate all securities and other
property that is not specifically identifiable property as soon as practicable after the commencement of the
case and in accordance with good market practice. If securities are restricted or trading has been suspended,
the trustee will have to make an exempt sale or file a registration statement. In the event of a private
placement, a customer is not entitled to "bid in" his net equity claim. To do so would enable him to receive a
greater percentage recovery than other customers.
Section 767(a) [enacted as section 766(h)] provides for the trustee to distribute customer property pro rata
according to customers' net equity claims. The court will determine an equitable portion of customer property
to pay administrative expenses. Paragraphs (2) and (3) indicate that the return of specifically identifiable
property constitutes a distribution of net equity.
Subsection (b) [enacted as section 766(i)] indicates that if the debtor is a clearing organization, customer
property is to be segregated into customers' accounts and proprietary accounts and distributed accordingly
without offset. This protects a member's customers from having their claims offset against the member's
proprietary account. Subsection (c)(1) [enacted as section 766(j)(1)] indicates that any excess customer
property will pour over into the general estate. This unlikely event would occur only if customers fail to file
proofs of claim. Subsection (c)(2) [enacted as section 766(j)(2)] indicates that to the extent customers are not
paid in full, they are entitled to share in the general estate as unsecured creditors, unless subordinated by the
court under proposed 11 U.S.C. 510.
Section 768(a) [enacted as section 766(c)] requires the trustee to return specifically identifiable property to
the extent that such distribution will not exceed a customer's net equity claim. Thus, if the customer owes
[Release Point 118-106]
money to a commodity broker, this will be offset under section 761(15)(A)(ii). If the value of the specifically
identifiable property exceeds the net equity claim, then the customer may deposit cash with the trustee to
make up the difference after which the trustee may return or transfer the customer's property.
Subsection (c) [enacted as section 766(a)] permits the trustee to answer all margin calls, to the extent of the
customer's net equity claim, with respect to any specifically identifiable open contractual commitment. It
should be noted that any payment under subsections (a) or (c) will be considered a reduction of the net equity
claim under section 767(a). Thus the customer's net equity claim is a dynamic amount that varies with
distributions of specifically identifiable property or margin payments on such property. This approach differs
from the priority given to specifically identifiable property under subchapter III of chapter 7 by limiting the
priority effect to a right to receive specific property as part of, rather than in addition to, a ratable share of
customer property. This policy is designed to protect the small customer who is unlikely to have property in
specifically identifiable form as compared with the professional trader. The CFTC is authorized to make rules
defining specifically identifiable property under section 302 of the bill, in title III.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
[Release Point 118-106]
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Chapter 9 of the House amendment represents a compromise between chapter 9 of the House bill and 9 of
the Senate amendment. In most respects this chapter follows current law with respect to the adjustment of
debts of a municipality. Stylistic changes and minor substantive revisions have been made in order to conform
this chapter with other new chapters of the bankruptcy code. There are few major differences between the
House bill and the Senate amendment on this issue. Section 901 indicates the applicability of other sections of
title 11 in cases under chapter 9. Included are sections providing for creditors' committees under sections 1102
and 1103.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Section 901 makes applicable appropriate provisions of other chapters of proposed title 11. The general rule
set out in section 103(e) is that only the provisions of chapters 1 and 9 apply in a chapter 9 case. Section 901 is
the exception, and specifies other provisions that do apply. They are as follows:
§301. Voluntary cases. Application of this section makes clear, as under current chapter IX [chapter 9 of
former title 11], that a municipal case can be commenced only by the municipality itself. There are no
involuntary chapter 9 cases.
§344. Self-incrimination; immunity. Application of this section is of no substantive effect for the
administration of the case, but merely provides that the general rules in part V [§6001 et seq.] of title 18
govern immunity.
§347(b). Unclaimed property. This provision currently appears in section 96(d) of chapter IX [section
416(d) of former title 11].
§349. Effect of dismissal. This section governs the effect of a dismissal of a chapter 9 case. It provides in
substance that rights that existed before the case that were disturbed by the commencement of the case are
reinstated. This section does not concern grounds for dismissal, which are found in section 926.
§361. Adequate protection. Section 361 provides the general standard for the protection of secured creditors
whose property is used in a case under title 11. Its importance lies in its application to sections 362 and 364.
§362. Automatic stay. The automatic stay provisions of the general portions of the title are incorporated into
chapter 9. There is an automatic stay provided in current Bankruptcy Act §85(e) [section 405(e) of former title
11]. The thrust of section 362 is the same as that of section 85(e), but, of course, its application in chapter 9 is
modernized and drafted to conform with the stay generally applicable under the bankruptcy code. An
additional part of the automatic stay applicable only to municipal cases is included in section 922.
§§364(c), 364(d), 364(e). Obtaining credit. This section governs the borrowing of money by a municipality
in reorganization. It is narrower than a comparable provision in current law, section 82(b)(2) [section
402(b)(2) of former title 11]. The difference lies mainly in the removal under the bill of the authority of the
court to supervise borrowing by the municipality in instances in which none of the special bankruptcy powers
are involved. That is, if a municipality could borrow money outside of the bankruptcy court, then it should
have the same authority in bankruptcy court, under the doctrine of Ashton v. Cameron Water District No. 1,
298 U.S. 513 (1936) [Tex.1936, 56 S.Ct. 892, 80 L.Ed. 1309, 31 Am.Bankr.Rep.N.S. 96, rehearing denied 57
S.Ct. 5, 299 U.S. 619, 81 L.Ed. 457] and National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976)
[Dist.Col.1976, 96 S.Ct. 2465, 49 L.Ed.2d 245, on remand 429 F. Supp. 703]. Only when the municipality
needs special authority, such as subordination of existing liens, or special priority for the borrowed funds, will
the court become involved in the authorization.
§365. Executory contracts and unexpired leases. The applicability of section 365 incorporates the general
power of a bankruptcy court to authorize the assumption or rejection of executory contracts or unexpired
leases found in other chapters of the title. This section is comparable to section 82(b)(1) of current law
[section 402(b)(1) of former title 11].
§366. Utility service. This section gives a municipality the same authority as any other debtor with respect
to continuation of utility service during the proceeding, provided adequate assurance of future payment is
provided. No comparable explicit provision is found in current law, although the case law seems to support
the same result.
§501. Filing of proofs of claims. This section permits filing of proofs of claims in a chapter 9 case. Note,
however, that section 924 permits listing of creditors' claims, as under chapter 11 and under section 85(b) of
chapter IX [section 405(b) of former title 11].
§502. Allowance of claims. This section applies the general allowance rules to chapter 9 cases. This is no
change from current law.
§503. Administrative expenses. Administrative expenses as defined in section 503 will be paid in a chapter
9 case, as provided under section 89(1) of current law [section 409(1) of former title 11].
§504. Sharing of compensation. There is no comparable provision in current law. However, this provision
[Release Point 118-106]
applies generally throughout the proposed law, and will not affect the progress of the case, only the
interrelations between attorneys and other professionals that participate in the case.
§506. Determination of secured status. Section 506 specifies that claims secured by a lien should be
separated, to the extent provided, into secured and unsecured claims. It applies generally. Current law follows
this result, though there is no explicit provision.
§507(1). Priorities. Paragraph (1) of section 507 requires that administrative expenses be paid first. This
rule will apply in chapter 9 cases. It is presently found in section 89(1) [section 409(1) of former title 11]. The
two other priorities presently found in section 89 have been deleted. The second for claims arising within 3
months before the case is commenced, is deleted from the statute, but may be within the court's equitable
power to award, under the case of Fosdick v. Schall, 99 U.S. 235 (1878) [25 L.Ed. 339]. Leaving the provision
to the courts permits greater flexibility, as under railroad cases, than an absolute three-month rule. The third
priority under current law, for claims which are entitled to priority under the laws of the United States, is
deleted because of the proposed amendment to section 3466 of the Revised Statutes [former 31 U.S.C. 191,
see 31 U.S.C. 3713(a)] contained in section 321(a) of title III of the bill, which previously has given the
United States an absolute first priority in chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11] and section 77 [section 205
of former title 11] cases. Because the priority rules are regularized and brought together in the bankruptcy
laws by this bill, the need for incorporation of priorities elsewhere specified is eliminated.
§509. Claims of codebtors. This section provides for the treatment of sureties, guarantors, and codebtors.
The general rule of postponement found in the other chapters will apply in chapter 9. This section adopts
current law.
§510. Subordination of claims. This section permits the court to subordinate, on equitable grounds, any
claim, and requires enforcement of contractual subordination agreements, and subordination of securities
rescission claims. The section recognizes the inherent equitable power of the court under current law, and the
practice followed with respect to contractual provisions.
§547. Preferences. Incorporation of section 547 will permit the debtor to recover preferences. This power
will be used primarily when those who gave the preferences have been replaced by new municipal officers or
when creditors coerced preferential payments. Unlike Bankruptcy Act §85(h) [section 405(h) of former title
11], the section does not permit the appointment of a trustee for the purpose of pursuing preferences.
Moreover, this bill does not incorporate the other avoiding powers of a trustee for chapter 9, found in current
section 85(h).
§550. Liability of transfers. Incorporation of this section is made necessary by the incorporation of the
preference section, and permits recovery by the debtor from a transferee of an avoided preference.
§551. Automatic preservation of avoided transfer. Application of section 551 requires preservation of any
avoided preference for the benefit of the estate.
§552. Postpetition effect of security interest. This section will govern the applicability after the
commencement of the case of security interests granted by the debtor before the commencement of the case.
§553. Setoff. Under current law, certain setoff is stayed. Application of this section preserves that result,
though the setoffs that are permitted under section 553 are better defined than under present law. Application
of this section is necessary to stay the setoff and to provide the offsetting creditor with the protection to which
he is entitled under present law.
§1122. Classification of claims. This section is derived from current section 88(b) [section 408(b) of former
title 11], and is substantially similar.
§1123(a)(1)–(4), (b). Contents of plan. The general provisions governing contents of a chapter 11 plan are
made applicable here, with two exceptions relating to the rights of stockholders, which are not applicable in
chapter 9 cases. This section expands current law by specifying the contents of a plan in some detail. Section
91 of current law [section 411 of former title 11] speaks only in general terms. The substance of the two
sections is substantially the same, however.
§1124. Impairment of claims. The confirmation standards adopted in chapter 9 are the same as those of
chapter 11. This changes current chapter IX [chapter 9 of former title 11], which requires compliance with the
fair and equitable rule. The greater flexibility of proposed chapter 11 is carried over into chapter 9, for there
appears to be no reason why the confirmation standards for the two chapters should be different, or why the
elimination of the fair and equitable rule from corporate reorganizations should not be followed in municipal
debt adjustments. The current chapter IX rule is based on the confirmation rules of current chapter X [chapter
10 of former title 11]. The change in the latter suggests a corresponding change in the former. Section 1124 is
one part of the new confirmation standard. It defines impairment, for use in section 1129.
§1125. Postpetition disclosure and solicitation. The change in the confirmation standard necessitates a
corresponding change in the disclosure requirements for solicitation of acceptances of a plan. Under current
chapter IX [chapter 9 of former title 11] there is no disclosure requirement. Incorporation of section 1125 will
[Release Point 118-106]
insure that creditors receive adequate information before they are required to vote on a plan.
§1126(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), (g). Acceptance of plan. Section 1126 incorporates the current chapter IX
[chapter 9 of former title 11] acceptance requirement: two-thirds in amount and a majority in number,
Bankruptcy Act §92 [section 412 of former title 11]. Section 1125 permits exclusion of certain acceptances
from the computation if the acceptances were obtained in bad faith or, unlike current law, if there is a conflict
of interest motivating the acceptance.
§1127(d). Modification of plan. This section governs the change of a creditor's vote on the plan after a
modification is proposed. It is derived from current section 92(e) [section 412(e) of former title 11].
§1128. Hearing on confirmation. This section requires a hearing on the confirmation of the plan, and
permits parties in interest to object. It is the same as Bankruptcy Act §§93 and 94(a) [sections 413 and 414(a)
of former title 11], though the provision, comparable to section 206 of current chapter X [section 606 of
former title 11], permitting a labor organization to appear and be heard on the economic soundness of the plan,
has been deleted as more appropriate for the Rules.
§1129(a)(2), (3), (8), (b)(1), (2). Confirmation of plan. This section provides the boiler-plate language that
the plan be proposed in good faith and that it comply with the provisions of the chapter, and also provides the
financial standard for confirmation, which replaces the fair and equitable rule. See §1124, supra.
§1142(b). Execution of plan. Derived from Bankruptcy Act §96(b) [section 416(b) of former title 11], this
section permits the court to order execution and delivery of instruments in order to execute the plan.
§1143. Distribution. This section is the same in substance as section 96(d) [section 416(d) of former title
11], which requires presentment or delivery of securities within five years, and bars creditors that do not act
within that time.
§1144. Revocation of order of confirmation. This section permits the court to revoke the order of
confirmation and the discharge if the confirmation of the plan was procured by fraud. There is no comparable
provision in current chapter IX [chapter 9 of former title 11].

LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 902(2) of the Senate amendment is deleted since the bankruptcy court will have jurisdiction over all
cases under chapter 9. The concept of a claim being materially and adversely affected reflected in section
902(1) of the Senate amendment has been deleted and replaced with the new concept of "impairment" set forth
in section 1124 of the House amendment and incorporated by reference into chapter 9.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
There are six definitions for use in chapter 9. Paragraph (1) defines what claims are included in a chapter 9
case and adopts the definition now found in section 81(1) [section 401(1) of former title 11]. All claims
against the petitioner generally will be included, with one significant exception. Municipalities are authorized,
under section 103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended [title 26], to issue tax-exempt
industrial development revenue bonds to provide for the financing of certain projects for privately owned
companies. The bonds are sold on the basis of the credit of the company on whose behalf they are issued, and
the principal, interest, and premium, if any, are payable solely from payments made by the company to the
trustee under the bond indenture and do not constitute claims on the tax revenues or other funds of the issuing
municipalities. The municipality merely acts as the vehicle to enable the bonds to be issued on a tax-exempt
basis. Claims that arise by virtue of these bonds are not among the claims defined by this paragraph and
amounts owed by private companies to the holders of industrial development revenue bonds are not to be
included among the assets of the municipality that would be affected by the plan. See Cong. Record, 94th
Cong., 1st Sess. H.R. 12073 (statement by Mr. Don Edwards, floor manager of the bill in the House).
[Release Point 118-106]
Paragraph (2) defines the court which means the federal district court or federal district judge before which the
case is pending. Paragraph (3) [enacted as (1)] specifies that when the term "property of the estate" is used in a
section in another chapter made applicable in chapter 9 cases, the term means "property of the debtor".
Paragraphs (4) and (5) [enacted as (2) and (3)] adopt the definition of "special taxpayer affected by the plan"
that appears in current sections 81(10) and 81(11) of the Bankruptcy Act [section 401(10) and (11) of former
title 11]. Paragraph (6) [enacted as (4)] provides that "trustee" means "debtor" when used in conjunction with
chapter 9.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
There are only four definitions for use only in chapter 9. The first specifies that when the term "property of
the estate" is used in a section in another chapter made applicable in chapter 9 cases, the term will mean
"property of the debtor". Paragraphs (2) and (3) adopt the definition of "special taxpayer affected by the plan"
that appears in current sections 81(10) and 81(11) [section 401(10) and (11) of former title 11]. Paragraph (4)
provides for "trustee" the same treatment as provided for "property of the estate", specifying that it means
"debtor" when used in conjunction with chapter 9.

§903. Reservation of State power to control municipalities
This chapter does not limit or impair the power of a State to control, by legislation or otherwise, a
municipality of or in such State in the exercise of the political or governmental powers of such
municipality, including expenditures for such exercise, but—
(1) a State law prescribing a method of composition of indebtedness of such municipality may
not bind any creditor that does not consent to such composition; and
(2) a judgment entered under such a law may not bind a creditor that does not consent to such
composition.

LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 903 of the House amendment represents a stylistic revision of section 903 of the Senate
amendment. To the extent section 903 of the House bill would have changed present law, such section is
rejected.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 903 is derived, with stylistic changes, from section 83 of current Chapter IX [section 403 of former
title 11]. It sets forth the primary authority of a State, through its constitution, laws, and other powers, over its
municipalities. The proviso in section 83, prohibiting State composition procedures for municipalities, is
retained. Deletion of the provision would "permit all States to enact their own versions of Chapter IX [chapter
9 of former title 11]", Municipal Insolvency, 50 Am.Bankr.L.J. 55, 65, which would frustrate the
constitutional mandate of uniform bankruptcy laws. Constitution of the United States, Art. I, Sec. 8.
This section provides that the municipality can consent to the court's orders in regard to use of its income or
property. It is contemplated that such consent will be required by the court for the issuance of certificates of
indebtedness under section 364(c). Such consent could extend to enforcement of the conditions attached to the
certificates or the municipal services to be provided during the proceedings.

Notwithstanding any power of the court, unless the debtor consents or the plan so provides, the
court may not, by any stay, order, or decree, in the case or otherwise, interfere with—

(2) any of the property or revenues of the debtor; or

(a) Notwithstanding sections 109(d) and 301 of this title, a case under this chapter concerning an

commenced by the filing under section 301 of this title of a petition under this chapter by such
district's governing authority or the board or body having authority to levy taxes or assessments to
meet the obligations of such district.
(b) The chief judge of the court of appeals for the circuit embracing the district in which the case
is commenced shall designate the bankruptcy judge to conduct the case.
(c) After any objection to the petition, the court, after notice and a hearing, may dismiss the
petition if the debtor did not file the petition in good faith or if the petition does not meet the
requirements of this title.
(d) If the petition is not dismissed under subsection (c) of this section, the court shall order relief

(e) The court may not, on account of an appeal from an order for relief, delay any proceeding
under this chapter in the case in which the appeal is being taken; nor shall any court order a stay of

Section 905 of the Senate amendment is incorporated as section 921(b) of the House amendment with the
difference that the chief judge of the circuit embracing the district in which the case is commenced designates
a bankruptcy judge to conduct the case in lieu of a district judge as under present law. It is intended that a
municipality may commence a case in any district in which the municipality is located, as under present law.
Section 906 of the Senate amendment has been adopted in substance in section 109(c) of the House
amendment.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 905 [enacted as section 921(b)] adopts the procedures for selection of the judge for the chapter 9
case as found in current section 82(d) [section 402(d) of former title 11]. It is expected that the large chapter 9
case might take up almost all the judicial time of the presiding judge and involve very complex legal
questions. Selection should not be left to chance or the luck of the draw. This provision will insure that
calendar demands and levels of experience can be considered in the selection of the judge in a chapter 9 case.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (a) is derived from section 85(a) [section 405(a) of former title 11], second sentence, of current
law. There is no substantive change in the law. The subsection permits a municipality that does not have its
own officers to be moved into chapter 9 by the action of the body or board that has authority to levy taxes for
the municipality.
Subsection (b) permits a party in interest to object to the filing of the petition not later than 15 days after
notice. This provision tracks the third sentence of section 85(a) [section 405(a) of former title 11], except that
the provision for publication in section 85(a) is left to the Rules (see Rule 9–14), and therefore the
determinative date is left less definite.
Subsection (c) permits the court to dismiss a petition not filed in good faith or not filed in compliance with
the requirements of the chapter. This provision is the fourth sentence of section 85(a) [section 405(a) of
former title 11].
Subsection (d) directs the court to order relief on the petition if it does not dismiss the case under subsection

(c) If the debtor provides, under section 362, 364, or 922 of this title, adequate protection of the
interest of the holder of a claim secured by a lien on property of the debtor and if, notwithstanding
such protection such creditor has a claim arising from the stay of action against such property under
section 362 or 922 of this title or from the granting of a lien under section 364(d) of this title, then
such claim shall be allowable as an administrative expense under section 503(b) of this title.
(d) Notwithstanding section 362 of this title and subsection (a) of this section, a petition filed
under this chapter does not operate as a stay of application of pledged special revenues in a manner
consistent with section 927 of this title to payment of indebtedness secured by such revenues.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 923 of the House amendment represents a compromise with respect to the notice provisions
contained in comparable provisions of the House bill and Senate amendment. As a general matter, title 11
leaves most procedural issues to be determined by the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. Section 923 of the
House amendment contains certain important aspects of procedure that have been retained from present law. It
is anticipated that the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure will adopt rules similar to the present rules for chapter
IX of the Bankruptcy Act [chapter 9 of former title 11].
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
The notice provisions in section 923 are significantly more sparse than those provided under section 85(d)
of chapter IX [section 405(d) of former title 11]. The exact contours of the notice to be given under chapter 9
are left to the Rules. Because the Rules deal with notice in a municipal case (Rule 9–14), and because section
405(d) of title IV of the bill continues those Rules in effect to the extent not inconsistent with the bill, the
notice provisions of current law and Rules would continue to apply.
§924. List of creditors
The debtor shall file a list of creditors.

of section 724 [probably should be "924"] of the Senate bill are anticipated to be incorporated in the rules of
bankruptcy procedure.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section adopts the provision presently contained in section 85(b) of Chapter IX [section 405(b) of

HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
This section directs the debtor to file a list of creditors with the court. A comparable provision is presently
contained in section 85(b) of chapter IX [section 405(b) of former title 11]. The Rules, in Rule 9–7, copy the
provisions of section 85(b), with additional matter. As noted above, section 405(d) of title IV will continue
those Rules in effect. Because the form, time of filing, and nature of the list, are procedural matters that may

unliquidated.

LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 925 of the Senate amendment regarding venue and fees has been deleted.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 926 [enacted as section 925] follows the policy contained in section 88(a) of the present Act
[section 408(a) of former title 11], though certain details are left to the Rules. The language of section 926 is
the same as that of proposed 11 U.S.C. 1111, which applies in chapter 11 cases. The list of creditors filed
under section 924 is given weight as prima facie evidence of the claims listed (except claims that are listed as
disputed, contingent, or unliquidated), which are deemed filed under section 501, obviating the need for listed
creditors to file proofs of claim.
§926. Avoiding powers
(a) If the debtor refuses to pursue a cause of action under section 544, 545, 547, 548, 549(a), or
550 of this title, then on request of a creditor, the court may appoint a trustee to pursue such cause of
action.
(b) A transfer of property of the debtor to or for the benefit of any holder of a bond or note, on
account of such bond or note, may not be avoided under section 547 of this title.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2623; Pub. L. 100–597, §6, Nov. 3, 1988, 102 Stat. 3029.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 926 of the House amendment is derived from section 928 of the Senate bill. The provision enables
creditors to request the court to appoint a trustee to pursue avoiding powers if the debtor refuses to exercise
those powers. Section 901 of the House amendment makes a corresponding change to incorporate avoiding
powers included in the Senate amendment, but excluded from the House bill.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section [928 (enacted as section 926)] adopts current section 85(h) [section 405(h) of former title 11]
which provides for a trustee to be appointed for the purpose of pursuing an action under an avoiding power, if
the debtor refuses to do so. This section is necessary because a municipality might, by reason of political
[Release Point 118-106]
pressure or desire for future good relations with a particular creditor or class of creditors, make payments to
such creditors in the days preceding the petition to the detriment of all other creditors. No change in the
elected officials of such a city would automatically occur upon filing of the petition, and it might be very
awkward for those same officials to turn around and demand the return of the payments following the filing of
the petition. Hence, the need for a trustee for such purpose.
The general avoiding powers are incorporated by reference in section 901 and are broader than under
current law. Preference, fraudulent conveyances, and other kinds of transfers will thus be voidable.
Incorporated by reference also is the power to accept or reject executory contracts and leases (section 365).
Within the definition of executory contracts are collective bargaining agreements between the city and its
employees. Such contracts may be rejected despite contrary State laws. Courts should readily allow the
rejection of such contracts where they are burdensome, the rejection will aid in the municipality's
reorganization and in consideration of the equities of each case. On the last point, "[e]quities in favor of the
city in chapter 9 will be far more compelling than the equities in favor of the employer in chapter 11. Onerous
employment obligations may prevent a city from balancing its budget for some time. The prospect of an
unbalanced budget may preclude judicial confirmation of the plan. Unless a city can reject its labor contracts,
lack of funds may force cutbacks in police, fire, sanitation, and welfare services, imposing hardships on many
citizens. In addition, because cities in the past have often seemed immune to the constraint of "profitability"
faced by private businesses, their wage contracts may be relatively more onerous than those in the private
sector." Executory Contracts and Municipal Bankruptcy, 85 Yale L. J. 957, 965 (1976) (footnote omitted).
Rejection of the contracts may require the municipalities to renegotiate such contracts by state collective
bargaining laws. It is intended that the power to reject collective bargaining agreements will pre-empt state
termination provisions, but not state collective bargaining laws. Thus, a city would not be required to maintain
existing employment terms during the renegotiation period.

LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 927(b) of the House amendment is derived from section 927(b) of the Senate bill. The provision
requires mandatory dismissal if confirmation of a plan is refused.
The House amendment deletes section 929 of the Senate amendment as unnecessary since the bankruptcy
court has original exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under chapter 9.
The House amendment deletes section 930 of the Senate amendment and incorporates section 507(a)(1) by

SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 927 conforms to section 98 of current law [section 418 of former title 11]. The Section permits
dismissal by the court for unreasonable delay by the debtor, failure to propose a plan, failure of acceptance of
a plan, or default by the debtor under a conformed plan. Mandatory dismissal is required if confirmation is
refused.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Section 926 [enacted as section 927] generally conforms to section 98(a) [section 418(a) of former title 11]
of current law. Stylistic changes have been made to conform the language with that used in chapter 11, section
1112. The section permits dismissal by the court for unreasonable delay by the debtor that is prejudicial to
creditors, failure to propose a plan, failure of confirmation of a plan, or material default by the debtor under a
confirmed plan. The only significant change from current law lies in the second ground. Currently, section
98(a)(2) provides for dismissal if a proposed plan is not accepted, and section 98(b) requires dismissal if an
accepted plan is not confirmed. In order to provide greater flexibility to the court, the debtor, and creditors, the
bill allows the court to permit the debtor to propose another plan if the first plan is not confirmed. In that event
the debtor need not, as under current law, commence the case all over again. This could provide savings in
time and administrative expenses if a plan is denied confirmation.

§943. Confirmation
(a) A special tax payer may object to confirmation of a plan.
(b) The court shall confirm the plan if—
(1) the plan complies with the provisions of this title made applicable by sections 103(e) 1 and
901 of this title;
(2) the plan complies with the provisions of this chapter;
(3) all amounts to be paid by the debtor or by any person for services or expenses in the case or
incident to the plan have been fully disclosed and are reasonable;
(4) the debtor is not prohibited by law from taking any action necessary to carry out the plan;
(5) except to the extent that the holder of a particular claim has agreed to a different treatment
of such claim, the plan provides that on the effective date of the plan each holder of a claim of a
kind specified in section 507(a)(2) of this title will receive on account of such claim cash equal to
the allowed amount of such claim;
(6) any regulatory or electoral approval necessary under applicable nonbankruptcy law in order
to carry out any provision of the plan has been obtained, or such provision is expressly
conditioned on such approval; and
(7) the plan is in the best interests of creditors and is feasible.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 943(a) of the House amendment makes clear that a special taxpayer may object to confirmation of a
plan. Section 943(b) of the House amendment is derived from section 943 of the House bill respecting
confirmation of a plan under chapter 9. It must be emphasized that these standards of confirmation are in
addition to standards in section 1129 that are made applicable to chapter 9 by section 901 of the House
amendment. In particular, if the requirements of sections 1129(a)(8) are not complied with, then the proponent
may request application of section 1129(b). The court will then be required to confirm the plan if it complies
with the "fair and equitable" test and is in the best interests of creditors. The best interests of creditors test
does not mean liquidation value as under chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act [chapter 11 of former title 11]. In
making such a determination, it is expected that the court will be guided by standards set forth in Kelley v.
Everglades Drainage District, 319 U.S. 415 (1943) [Fla.1943, 63 S.Ct. 1141, 87 L.Ed. 1485, rehearing denied
63 S.Ct. 1444, 320 U.S. 214, 87 L.Ed. 1851, motion denied 64 S.Ct 783, 321 U.S. 754, 88 L.Ed. 1054] and
Fano v. Newport Heights Irrigation Dist., 114 F.2d 563 (9th Cir. 1940), as under present law, the bankruptcy
[Release Point 118-106]
court should make findings as detailed as possible to support a conclusion that this test has been met.
However, it must be emphasized that unlike current law, the fair and equitable test under section 1129(b) will
not apply if section 1129(a)(8) has been satisfied in addition to the other confirmation standards specified in
section 943 and incorporated by reference in section 901 of the House amendment. To the extent that
American United Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. City of Avon Park, 311 U.S. 138 (1940) [Fla.1940, 61 S.Ct.
157, 85 L.Ed. 91, 136 A.L.R. 860, rehearing denied 61 S.Ct. 395, 311 U.S. 730, 85 L.Ed. 475] and other cases
are to the contrary, such cases are overruled to that extent.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 946 [enacted as section 943] is adopted from current section 94 [section 414 of former title 11]. The
test for confirmation is whether or not the plan is fair and equitable and feasible. The fair and equitable test
tracts current chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11] and is known as the strict priority rule. Creditors must
be provided, under the plan, the going concern value of their claims. The going concern value contemplates a
"comparison of revenues and expenditures taking into account the taxing power and the extent to which tax
increases are both necessary and feasible" Municipal Insolvency, supra, at p. 64, and is intended to provide
more of a return to creditors than the liquidation value if the city's assets could be liquidated like those of a
private corporation.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
In addition to the confirmation requirements incorporated from section 1129 by section 901, this section
specifies additional requirements. Paragraph (1) requires compliance with the provisions of the title made
applicable in chapter 9 cases. This provision follows section 94(b)(2) [section 414(b)(2) of former title 11].
Paragraph (2) requires compliance with the provisions of chapter 9, as does section 94(b)(2). Paragraph (3)
adopts section 94(b)(4), requiring disclosure and reasonableness of all payments to be made in connection
with the plan or the case. Paragraph (4), copied from section 92(b)(6) [probably should be "94(b)(6)" which
was section 414(b)(6) of former title 11], requires that the debtor not be prohibited by law from taking any
action necessary to carry out the plan. Paragraph (5) departs from current law by requiring that administrative
expenses be paid in full, but not necessarily in cash. Finally, paragraph (6) requires that the plan be in the best
interest of creditors and feasible. The best interest test was deleted in section 94(b)(1) of current chapter IX
from previous chapter IX [chapter 9 of former title 11] because it was redundant with the fair and equitable
rule. However, this bill proposes a new confirmation standard generally for reorganization, one element of
which is the best interest of creditors test; see section 1129(a)(7). In that section, the test is phrased in terms of
liquidation of the debtor. Because that is not possible in a municipal case, the test here is phrased in its more
traditional form, using the words of art "best interest of creditors." The best interest of creditors test here is in
addition to the financial standards imposed on the plan by sections 1129(a)(8) and 1129(b), just as those
provisions are in addition to the comparable best interest test in chapter 11, 11 U.S.C. 1129(a)(7). The
feasibility requirement, added in the revision of chapter IX last year, is retained.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Chapter 11 of the House amendment is derived in large part from chapter 11 as contained in the House bill.
Unlike chapter 11 of the Senate amendment, chapter 11 of the House amendment does not represent an
extension of chapter X of current law [chapter 10 of former title 11] or any other chapter of the Bankruptcy
Act [former title 11]. Rather chapter 11 of the House amendment takes a new approach consolidating subjects
dealt with under chapters VIII, X, XI, and XII of the Bankruptcy Act [chapters 8, 10, 11, and 12 of former title
11]. The new consolidated chapter 11 contains no special procedure for companies with public debt or equity
security holders. Instead, factors such as the standard to be applied to solicitation of acceptances of a plan of
reorganization are left to be determined by the court on a case-by-case basis. In order to insure that adequate
investigation of the debtor is conducted to determine fraud or wrongdoing on the part of present management,
an examiner is required to be appointed in all cases in which the debtor's fixed, liquidated, and unsecured
debts, other than debts for goods, services, or taxes, or owing to an insider, exceed $5 million. This should
adequately represent the needs of public security holders in most cases. However, in addition, section 1109 of
the House amendment enables both the Securities and Exchange Commission and any party in interest who is
creditor, equity security holder, indenture trustee, or any committee representing creditors or equity security
holders to raise and appear and be heard on any issue in a case under chapter 11. This will enable the
bankruptcy court to evaluate all sides of a position and to determine the public interest. This approach is
sharply contrasted to that under chapter X of present law in which the public interest is often determined only
in terms of the interest of public security holders. The advisory role of the Securities and Exchange
Commission will enable the court to balance the needs of public security holders against equally important
public needs relating to the economy, such as employment and production, and other factors such as the public
health and safety of the people or protection of the national interest. In this context, the new chapter 11 deletes
archaic rules contained in certain chapters of present law such as the requirement of an approval hearing and
the prohibition of prepetition solicitation. Such requirements were written in an age before the enactment of
the Trust Indenture Act [15 U.S.C. 77aaa et seq.] and the development of securities laws had occurred. The
benefits of these provisions have long been outlived but the detriment of the provisions served to frustrate and
delay effective reorganization in those chapters of the Bankruptcy Act in which such provisions applied.
Chapter 11 thus represents a much needed revision of reorganization laws. A brief discussion of the history of
this important achievement is useful to an appreciation of the monumental reform embraced in chapter 11.
Under the existing Bankruptcy Act [former title 11] debtors seeking reorganization may choose among
three reorganization chapters, chapter X, chapter XI, and chapter XII [chapters 10, 11, and 12 of former title
11]. Individuals and partnerships may file under chapter XI or, if they own property encumbered by mortgage
liens, they may file under chapter XII. A corporation may file under either chapter X or chapter XI, but is
ineligible to file under chapter XII. Chapter X was designed to facilitate the pervasive reorganization of
corporations whose creditors include holders of publicly issued debt securities. Chapter XI, on the other hand,
was designed to permit smaller enterprises to negotiate composition or extension plans with their unsecured
creditors. The essential differences between chapters X and XI are as follows. Chapter X mandates that, first,
an independent trustee be appointed and assume management control from the officers and directors of the
debtor corporation; second, the Securities and Exchange Commission must be afforded an opportunity to
participate both as an adviser to the court and as a representative of the interests of public security holders;
third, the court must approve any proposed plan of reorganization, and prior to such approval, acceptances of
creditors and shareholders may not be solicited; fourth, the court must apply the absolute priority rule; and
fifth, the court has the power to affect, and grant the debtor a discharge in respect of, all types of claims,
whether secured or unsecured and whether arising by reason of fraud or breach of contract.
The Senate amendment consolidates chapters X, XI, and XII [chapters 10, 11, and 12 of former title 11],
but establishes a separate and distinct reorganization procedure for "public companies." The special provisions
applicable to "public companies" are tantamount to the codification of chapter X of the existing Bankruptcy
Act and thus result in the creation of a "two-track system." The narrow definition of the term "public
company" would require many businesses which could have been rehabilitated under chapter XI to instead use
the more cumbersome procedures of chapter X, whether needed or not.
The special provisions of the Senate amendment applicable to a "public company" are as follows:
(a) Section 1101(3) defines a "public company" as a debtor who, within 12 months prior to the filing of the
petition, had outstanding $5 million or more in debt and had not less than 1000 security holders;
(b) Section 1104(a) requires the appointment of a disinterested trustee irrespective of whether creditors
support such appointment and whether there is cause for such appointment;
[Release Point 118-106]
(c) Section 1125(f) prohibits the solicitation of acceptances of a plan of reorganization prior to court
approval of such plan even though the solicitation complies with all applicable securities laws;
(d) Section 1128(a) requires the court to conduct a hearing on any plan of reorganization proposed by the
trustee or any other party;
(e) Section 1128(b) requires the court to refer any plans "worthy of consideration" to the Securities and
Exchange Commission for their examination and report, prior to court approval of a plan; and
(f) Section 1128(c) and section 1130(a)(7) requires the court to approve a plan or plans which are "fair and
equitable" and comply with the other provisions of chapter 11.
The record of the Senate hearings on S. 2266 and the House hearings on H.R. 8200 is replete with evidence
of the failure of the reorganization provisions of the existing Bankruptcy Act [former title 11] to meet the
needs of insolvent corporations in today's business environment. Chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11] was
designed to impose rigid and formalized procedures upon the reorganization of corporations and, although
designed to protect public creditors, has often worked to the detriment of such creditors. As the House report
has noted:
The negative results under chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11] have resulted from the stilted
procedures, under which management is always ousted and replaced by an independent trustee, the courts and
the Securities and Exchange Commission examine the plan of reorganization in great detail, no matter how
long that takes, and the court values the business, a time consuming and inherently uncertain procedure.
The House amendment deletes the "public company" exception, because it would codify the well
recognized infirmities of chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11], because it would extend the chapter X
approach to a large number of new cases without regard to whether the rigid and formalized procedures of
chapter X are needed, and because it is predicated upon the myth that provisions similar to those contained in
chapter X are necessary for the protection of public investors. Bankruptcy practice in large reorganization
cases has also changed substantially in the 40 years since the Chandler Act [June 22, 1938, ch. 575, 52 Stat.
883, amending former title 11] was enacted. This change is, in large part, attributable to the pervasive effect of
the Federal securities laws and the extraordinary success of the Securities and Exchange Commission in
sensitizing both management and members of the bar to the need for full disclosure and fair dealing in
transactions involving publicly held securities.
It is important to note that Congress passed the Chandler Act [June 22, 1938, ch. 575, 52 Stat. 883,
amending former title 11] prior to enactment of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 [15 U.S.C. section 77aaa et
seq.] and prior to the definition and enforcement of the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act of 1933
[15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.] and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.]. The judgments made
by the 75th Congress in enacting the Chandler Act are not equally applicable to the financial markets of 1978.
First of all, most public debenture holders are neither weak nor unsophisticated investors. In most cases, a
significant portion of the holders of publicly issued debentures are sophisticated institutions, acting for their
own account or as trustees for investment funds, pension funds, or private trusts. In addition, debenture
holders, sophisticated, and unsophisticated alike, are represented by indenture trustees, qualified under section
77ggg of the Trust Indenture Act [probably should be "section 307" which is 15 U.S.C. 77ggg]. Given the
high standard of care to which indenture trustees are bound, they are invariably active and sophisticated
participants in efforts to rehabilitate corporate debtors in distress.
It is also important to note that in 1938 when the Chandler Act [June 22, 1938, ch. 575, 52 Stat. 883,
amending former title 11] was enacted, public investors commonly held senior, not subordinated, debentures
and corporations were very often privately owned. In this environment, the absolute priority rule protected
debenture holders from an erosion of their position in favor of equity holders. Today, however, if there are
public security holders in a case, they are likely to be holders of subordinated debentures and equity and thus
the application of the absolute priority rule under chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11] leads to the
exclusion, rather than the protection, of the public.
The primary problem posed by chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11] is delay. The modern corporation is
a complex and multifaceted entity. Most corporations do not have a significant market share of the lines of
business in which they compete. The success, and even the survival, of a corporation in contemporary markets
depends on three elements: First, the ability to attract and hold skilled management; second, the ability to
obtain credit; and third, the corporation's ability to project to the public an image of vitality. Over and over
again, it is demonstrated that corporations which must avail themselves of the provisions of the Bankruptcy
Act [former title 11] suffer appreciable deterioration if they are caught in a chapter X proceeding for any
substantial period of time.
There are exceptions to this rule. For example, King Resources filed a chapter X [chapter 10 of former title
11] petition in the District of Colorado and it emerged from such proceeding as a solvent corporation. The
debtor's new found solvency was not, however, so much attributable to a brilliant rehabilitation program
[Release Point 118-106]
conceived by a trustee, but rather to a substantial appreciation in the value of the debtor's oil and uranium
properties during the pendency of the proceedings.
Likewise, Equity Funding is always cited as an example of a successful chapter X [chapter 10 of former
title 11] case. But it should be noted that in Equity Funding there was no question about retaining existing
management. Rather, Equity Funding involved fraud on a grand scale. Under the House amendment with the
deletion of the mandatory appointment of a trustee in cases involving "public companies," a bankruptcy judge,
in a case like Equity Funding, would presumably have little difficulty in concluding that a trustee should be
appointed under section 1104(6).
While I will not undertake to list the chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11] failures, it is important to note
a number of cases involving corporations which would be "public companies" under the Senate amendment
which have successfully skirted the shoals of chapter X and confirmed plans of arrangement in chapter XI
[chapter 11 of former title 11]. Among these are Daylin, Inc. ("Daylin") and Colwell Mortgage Investors
("Colwell").
Daylin filed a chapter XI [chapter 11 of former title 11] petition on February 26, 1975, and confirmed its
plan of arrangement on October 20, 1976. The success of its turnaround is best evidenced by the fact that it
had consolidated net income of $6,473,000 for the first three quarters of the 1978 fiscal year.
Perhaps the best example of the contrast between chapter XI and chapter X [chapters 11 and 10 of former
title 11] is the recent case of In re Colwell Mortgage Investors. Colwell negotiated a recapitalization plan with
its institutional creditors, filed a proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and solicited
consents of its creditors and shareholders prior to filing its chapter XI petition. Thereafter, Colwell confirmed
its plan of arrangement 41 days after filing its chapter XI petition. This result would have been impossible
under the Senate amendment since Colwell would have been a "public company."
There are a number of other corporations with publicly held debt which have successfully reorganized
under chapter XI [chapter 11 of former title 11]. Among these are National Mortgage Fund (NMF), which
filed a chapter XI petition in the northern district of Ohio on June 30, 1976. Prior to commencement of the
chapter XI proceeding, NMF filed a proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
solicited acceptances to a proposed plan of arrangement. The NMF plan was subsequently confirmed on
December 14, 1976. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not file a motion under section 328 of the
Bankruptcy Act [section 728 of former title 11] to transfer the case to chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11]
and a transfer motion which was filed by private parties was denied by the court.
While there are other examples of large publicly held companies which have successfully reorganized in
chapter XI [chapter 11 of former title 11], including Esgrow, Inc. (C.D.Cal. 73–02510), Sherwood Diversified
Services Inc. (S.D.N.Y. 73–B–213), and United Merchants and Manufacturers, Inc. (S.D.N.Y. 77–B–1513),
the numerous successful chapter XI cases demonstrate two points: first, the complicated and time-consuming
provisions of chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11] are not always necessary for the successful
reorganization of a company with publicly held debt, and second, the more flexible provisions in chapter XI
permit a debtor to obtain relief under the Bankruptcy Act [former title 11] in significantly less time than is
required to confirm a plan of reorganization under chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act.
One cannot overemphasize the advantages of speed and simplicity to both creditors and debtors. Chapter XI
[chapter 11 of former title 11] allows a debtor to negotiate a plan outside of court and, having reached a
settlement with a majority in number and amount of each class of creditors, permits the debtor to bind all
unsecured creditors to the terms of the arrangement. From the perspective of creditors, early confirmation of a
plan of arrangement: first, generally reduces administrative expenses which have priority over the claims of
unsecured creditors; second, permits creditors to receive prompt distributions on their claims with respect to
which interest does not accrue after the filing date; and third, increases the ultimate recovery on creditor
claims by minimizing the adverse effect on the business which often accompanies efforts to operate an
enterprise under the protection of the Bankruptcy Act [former title 11].
Although chapter XI [chapter 11 of former title 11] offers the corporate debtor flexibility and continuity of
management, successful rehabilitation under chapter XI is often impossible for a number of reasons. First,
chapter XI does not permit a debtor to "affect" secured creditors or shareholders, in the absence of their
consent. Second, whereas a debtor corporation in chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11], upon the
consummation of the plan or reorganization, is discharged from all its debts and liabilities, a corporation in
chapter XI may not be able to get a discharge in respect of certain kinds of claims including fraud claims, even
in cases where the debtor is being operated under new management. The language of chapter 11 in the House
amendment solves these problems and thus increases the utility and flexibility of the new chapter 11, as
compared to chapter XI of the existing Bankruptcy Act [chapter 11 of former title 11].
Those who would urge the adoption of a two-track system have two major obstacles to meet. First, the
practical experience of those involved in business rehabilitation cases, practitioners, debtors, and bankruptcy
[Release Point 118-106]
judges, has been that the more simple and expeditious procedures of chapter XI [chapter 11 of former title 11]
are appropriate in the great majority of cases. While attempts have been made to convince the courts that a
chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11] proceeding is required in every case where public debt is present, the
courts have categorically rejected such arguments. Second, chapter X has been far from a success. Of the 991
chapter X cases filed during the period of January 1, 1967, through December 31, 1977, only 664 have been
terminated. Of those cases recorded as "terminated," only 140 resulted in consummated plans. This 21 percent
success rate suggests one of the reasons for the unpopularity of chapter X.
In summary, it has been the experience of the great majority of those who have testified before the Senate
and House subcommittees that a consolidated approach to business rehabilitation is warranted. Such approach
is adopted in the House amendment.
Having discussed the general reasons why chapter 11 of the House amendment is sorely needed, a brief
discussion of the differences between the House bill, Senate amendment, and the House amendment, is in
order. Since chapter 11 of the House amendment rejects the concept of separate treatment for a public
company, sections 1101(3), 1104(a), 1125(f), 1128, and 1130(a)(7) of the Senate amendment have been
deleted.

SUBCHAPTER I—OFFICERS AND ADMINISTRATION
§1101. Definitions for this chapter
In this chapter—
(1) "debtor in possession" means debtor except when a person that has qualified under section
322 of this title is serving as trustee in the case;
(2) "substantial consummation" means—
(A) transfer of all or substantially all of the property proposed by the plan to be transferred;
(B) assumption by the debtor or by the successor to the debtor under the plan of the business
or of the management of all or substantially all of the property dealt with by the plan; and
(C) commencement of distribution under the plan.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2626.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section contains definitions of three terms that are used in chapter 11. Paragraph (1) defines debtor in
possession to mean the debtor, except when a trustee who has qualified in serving in the case.
Paragraph (2), derived from section 229a of current law [section 629(a) of former title 11], defines
substantial consummation. Substantial consummation of a plan occurs when transfer of all or substantially all
of the property proposed by the plan to be transferred is actually transferred; when the debtor (or its successor)
has assumed the business of the debtor or the management of all or substantially all of the property dealt with
by the plan; and when distribution under the plan has commenced.
Paragraph (3) defines for purposes of Chapter 11 a public company to mean "a debtor who, within 12
[Release Point 118-106]
months prior to the filing of a petition for relief under this chapter, had outstanding liabilities of $5 million or
more, exclusive of liabilities for goods, services, or taxes and not less than 1,000 security holders." There are,
as noted, special safeguards for public investors related to the reorganization of a public company, as so
defined.
Both requirements must be met: liabilities, excluding tax obligations and trade liabilities, must be $5
million or more; and (2) the number of holders of securities, debt or equity, or both, must be not less than
1,000. The amount and number are to be determined as of any time within 12 months prior to the filing of the
petition for reorganization.
§1102. Creditors' and equity security holders' committees
(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), as soon as practicable after the order for relief under
chapter 11 of this title, the United States trustee shall appoint a committee of creditors holding
unsecured claims and may appoint additional committees of creditors or of equity security holders as
the United States trustee deems appropriate.
(2) On request of a party in interest, the court may order the appointment of additional committees
of creditors or of equity security holders if necessary to assure adequate representation of creditors or
of equity security holders. The United States trustee shall appoint any such committee.
(3) Unless the court for cause orders otherwise, a committee of creditors may not be appointed in a
small business case or a case under subchapter V of this chapter.
(4) On request of a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court may order the United
States trustee to change the membership of a committee appointed under this subsection, if the court
determines that the change is necessary to ensure adequate representation of creditors or equity
security holders. The court may order the United States trustee to increase the number of members of
a committee to include a creditor that is a small business concern (as described in section 3(a)(1) of
the Small Business Act), if the court determines that the creditor holds claims (of the kind
represented by the committee) the aggregate amount of which, in comparison to the annual gross
revenue of that creditor, is disproportionately large.
(b)(1) A committee of creditors appointed under subsection (a) of this section shall ordinarily
consist of the persons, willing to serve, that hold the seven largest claims against the debtor of the
kinds represented on such committee, or of the members of a committee organized by creditors
before the commencement of the case under this chapter, if such committee was fairly chosen and is
representative of the different kinds of claims to be represented.
(2) A committee of equity security holders appointed under subsection (a)(2) of this section shall
ordinarily consist of the persons, willing to serve, that hold the seven largest amounts of equity
securities of the debtor of the kinds represented on such committee.
(3) A committee appointed under subsection (a) shall—
(A) provide access to information for creditors who—
(i) hold claims of the kind represented by that committee; and
(ii) are not appointed to the committee;
(B) solicit and receive comments from the creditors described in subparagraph (A); and
(C) be subject to a court order that compels any additional report or disclosure to be made to the
creditors described in subparagraph (A).

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1102(a) of the House amendment adopts a compromise between the House bill and Senate
amendment requiring appointment of a committee of creditors holding unsecured claims by the court; the
[Release Point 118-106]
alternative of creditor committee election is rejected.
Section 1102(b) of the House amendment represents a compromise between the House bill and the Senate
amendment by preventing the appointment of creditors who are unwilling to serve on a creditors committee.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section provides for the election and appointment of committees. Subsection (c) provides that this
section does not apply in case of a public company, as to which a trustee, appointed under section 1104(a) will
have responsibility to administer the estate and to formulate a plan as provided in section 1106(a).
There is no need for the election or appointment of committees for which the appointment of a trustee is
mandatory. In the case of a public company there are likely to be several committees, each representing a
different class of security holders and seeking authority to retain accountants, lawyers, and other experts, who
will expect to be paid. If in the case of a public company creditors or stockholders wish to organize
committees, they may do so, as authorized under section 1109(a). Compensation and reimbursement will be
allowed for contributions to the reorganization pursuant to section 503(b) (3) and (4).
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
This section provides for the appointment of creditors' and equity security holders' committees, which will
be the primary negotiating bodies for the formulation of the plan of reorganization. They will represent the
various classes of creditors and equity security holders from which they are selected. They will also provide
supervision of the debtor in possession and of the trustee, and will protect their constituents' interests.
Subsection (a) requires the court to appoint at least one committee. That committee is to be composed of
creditors holding unsecured claims. The court is authorized to appoint such additional committees as are
necessary to assure adequate representation of creditors and equity security holders. The provision will be
relied upon in cases in which the debtor proposes to affect several classes of debt or equity holders under the
plan, and in which they need representation.
Subsection (b) contains precatory language directing the court to appoint the persons holding the seven
largest claims against the debtor of the kinds represented on a creditors' committee, or the members of a
prepetition committee organized by creditors before the order for relief under chapter 11. The court may
continue prepetition committee members only if the committee was fairly chosen and is representative of the
different kinds of claims to be represented. The court is restricted to the appointment of persons in order to
exclude governmental holders of claims or interests.
Paragraph (2) of subsection (b) requires similar treatment for equity security holders' committees. The
seven largest holders are normally to be appointed, but the language is only precatory.
Subsection (c) authorizes the court, on request of a party in interest, to change the size or the membership of
a creditors' or equity security holders' committee if the membership of the committee is not representative of
the different kinds of claims or interests to be represented. This subsection is intended, along with the
nonbinding nature of subsection (b), to afford the court latitude in appointing a committee that is manageable
and representative in light of the circumstances of the case.

SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section defines the powers and duties of a committee elected or appointed under section 1102.
Under subsection (a) the committee may, if authorized by the court, employ one or more attorneys,
accountants, or other agents to represent or perform services for the committee. Normally one attorney should
suffice; more than one may be authorized for good cause. The same considerations apply to the services of
others, if the need for any at all is demonstrated.
Under subsections (c) and (d) the committee, like any party in interest, may confer with the trustee or debtor
regarding the administration of the estate; may advise the court on the need for a trustee under section
1104(b). The committee may investigate matters specified in paragraph (2) of subsection (c), but only if
authorized by the court and if no trustee or examiner is appointed.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (a) of this section authorizes a committee appointed under section 1102 to select and authorize
the employment of counsel, accountants, or other agents, to represent or perform services for the committee.
The committee's selection and authorization is subject to the court's approval, and may only be done at a
meeting of the committee at which a majority of its members are present. The subsection provides for the
employment of more than one attorney. However, this will be the exception, and not the rule; cause must be
shown to depart from the normal standard.
Subsection (b) requires a committee's counsel to cease representation of any other entity in connection with
the case after he begins to represent the committee. This will prevent the potential of severe conflicts of
interest.
Subsection (c) lists a committee's functions in a chapter 11 case. The committee may consult with the
trustee or debtor in possession concerning the administration of the case, may investigate the acts, conduct,
assets, liabilities and financial condition of the debtor, the operation of the debtor's business, and the
desirability of the continuance of the business, and any other matter relevant to the case or to the formulation
of a plan. The committee may participate in the formulation of a plan, advise those it represents of the
committee's recommendation with respect to any plan formulated, and collect and file acceptances. These will
be its most important functions. The committee may also determine the need for the appointment of a trustee,
if one has not previously been appointed, and perform such other services as are in the interest of those
represented.
Subsection (d) requires the trustee and each committee to meet as soon as practicable after their
appointments to transact such business as may be necessary and proper.

§1104. Appointment of trustee or examiner
(a) At any time after the commencement of the case but before confirmation of a plan, on request
of a party in interest or the United States trustee, and after notice and a hearing, the court shall order
the appointment of a trustee—
(1) for cause, including fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, or gross mismanagement of the affairs
of the debtor by current management, either before or after the commencement of the case, or
similar cause, but not including the number of holders of securities of the debtor or the amount of
assets or liabilities of the debtor; or
(2) if such appointment is in the interests of creditors, any equity security holders, and other
interests of the estate, without regard to the number of holders of securities of the debtor or the
amount of assets or liabilities of the debtor.
(b)(1) Except as provided in section 1163 of this title, on the request of a party in interest made not
later than 30 days after the court orders the appointment of a trustee under subsection (a), the United
States trustee shall convene a meeting of creditors for the purpose of electing one disinterested
person to serve as trustee in the case. The election of a trustee shall be conducted in the manner
provided in subsections (a), (b), and (c) of section 702 of this title.
(2)(A) If an eligible, disinterested trustee is elected at a meeting of creditors under paragraph (1),
the United States trustee shall file a report certifying that election.
(B) Upon the filing of a report under subparagraph (A)—
(i) the trustee elected under paragraph (1) shall be considered to have been selected and
appointed for purposes of this section; and
(ii) the service of any trustee appointed under subsection (a) shall terminate.
(C) The court shall resolve any dispute arising out of an election described in subparagraph (A).
(c) If the court does not order the appointment of a trustee under this section, then at any time
before the confirmation of a plan, on request of a party in interest or the United States trustee, and
after notice and a hearing, the court shall order the appointment of an examiner to conduct such an
investigation of the debtor as is appropriate, including an investigation of any allegations of fraud,
dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularity in the management of the
affairs of the debtor of or by current or former management of the debtor, if—
(1) such appointment is in the interests of creditors, any equity security holders, and other
interests of the estate; or
(2) the debtor's fixed, liquidated, unsecured debts, other than debts for goods, services, or taxes,
or owing to an insider, exceed $5,000,000.
(d) If the court orders the appointment of a trustee or an examiner, if a trustee or an examiner dies
or resigns during the case or is removed under section 324 of this title, or if a trustee fails to qualify
under section 322 of this title, then the United States trustee, after consultation with parties in
interest, shall appoint, subject to the court's approval, one disinterested person other than the United
States trustee to serve as trustee or examiner, as the case may be, in the case.
(e) The United States trustee shall move for the appointment of a trustee under subsection (a) if
there are reasonable grounds to suspect that current members of the governing body of the debtor,
the debtor's chief executive or chief financial officer, or members of the governing body who
selected the debtor's chief executive or chief financial officer, participated in actual fraud,
dishonesty, or criminal conduct in the management of the debtor or the debtor's public financial
reporting.

[Release Point 118-106]
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1104 of the House amendment represents a compromise between the House bill and the Senate
amendment concerning the appointment of a trustee or examiner. The method of appointment rather than
election, is derived from the House bill; the two alternative standards of appointment are derived with
modifications from the Senate amendment, instead of the standard stated in the House bill. For example, if the
current management of the debtor gambled away rental income before the filing of the petition, a trustee
should be appointed after the petition, whether or not postpetition mismanagement can be shown. However,
under no circumstances will cause include the number of security holders of the debtor or the amount of assets
or liabilities of the debtor. The standard also applies to the appointment of an examiner in those circumstances
in which mandatory appointment, as previously detailed, is not required.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) provides for the mandatory appointment of a disinterested trustee in the case of a public
company, as defined in section 1101(3), within 10 days of the order for relief, or of a successor, in the event of
a vacancy, as soon as practicable.
Section 156 of chapter X ([former] 11 U.S.C. 516 [556]) requires the appointment of a disinterested trustee
if the debtor's liabilities are $250,000 or over. Section 1104(a) marks a substantial change. The appointment of
a trustee is mandatory only for a public company, which under section 1101(3), has $5 million in liabilities,
excluding tax and trade obligations, and 1,000 security holders. In view of past experience, cases involving
public companies will under normal circumstances probably be relatively few in number but of vast
importance in terms of public investor interest.
In case of a nonpublic company, the appointment or election of a trustee is discretionary if the interests of
the estate and its security holders would be served thereby. A test based on probable costs and benefits of a
trusteeship is not practical. The appointment may be made at any time prior to confirmation of the plan.
In case of a nonpublic company, if no trustee is appointed, the court may under subsection (c) appoint an
examiner, if the appointment would serve the interests of the estate and security holders. The purpose of his
appointment is specified in section 1106(b).
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (a) of this section governs the appointment of trustees in reorganization cases. The court is
permitted to order the appointment of one trustee at any time after the commencement of the case if a party in
interest so requests. The court may order appointment only if the protection afforded by a trustee is needed
and the costs and expenses of a trustee would not be disproportionately higher than the value of the protection
afforded.
The protection afforded by a trustee would be needed, for example, in cases where the current management
of the debtor has been fraudulent or dishonest, or has grossly mismanaged the company, or where the debtor's
management has abandoned the business. A trustee would not necessarily be needed to investigate misconduct
of former management of the debtor, because an examiner appointed under this section might well be able to
serve that function adequately without displacing the current management. Generally, a trustee would not be
needed in any case where the protection afforded by a trustee could equally be afforded by an examiner.
Though the device of examiner appears in current chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11], it is rarely used
because of the nearly absolute presumption in favor of the appointment of a trustee. Its use here will give the
courts, debtors, creditors, and equity security holders greater flexibility in handling the affairs of an insolvent
debtor, permitting the court to tailor the remedy to the case.
The second test, relating to the costs and expenses of a trustee, is not intended to be a strict cost/benefit
analysis. It is included to require the court to have due regard for any additional costs or expenses that the
appointment of a trustee would impose on the estate.
Subsection (b) permits the court, at any time after the commencement of the case and on request of a party
in interest, to order the appointment of an examiner, if the court has not ordered the appointment of a trustee.
The examiner would be appointed to conduct such an investigation of the debtor as is appropriate under the
particular circumstances of the case, including an investigation of any allegations of fraud, dishonesty, or
gross mismanagement of the debtor of or by current or former management of the debtor. The standards for
the appointment of an examiner are the same as those for the appointment of a trustee: the protection must be
needed, and the costs and expenses must not be disproportionately high.
By virtue of proposed 11 U.S.C. 1109, an indenture trustee and the Securities and Exchange Commission
will be parties in interest for the purpose of requesting the appointment of a trustee or examiner.
Subsection (c) directs that the United States trustee actually select and appoint the trustee or examiner
ordered appointed under this section. The United States trustee is required to consult with various parties in
[Release Point 118-106]
interest before selecting and appointing a trustee. He is not bound to select one of the members of the panel of
private trustees established under proposed 28 U.S.C. 586(a)(1) which exists only for the purpose of providing
trustees for chapter 7 cases. Neither is he precluded from selecting a panel member if the member is qualified
to serve as chapter 11 trustee. Appointment by the United States trustee will remove the court from the often
criticized practice of appointing an officer that will appear in litigation before the court against an adverse
party.

business, and any other matter relevant to the case or to the formulation of a plan. Paragraph (4) requires the
trustee to report the results of his investigation to the court and to creditors' committees, equity security
holders' committees, indenture trustees and any other entity the court designates.
Paragraph (5) requires the trustee to file a plan or to report why a plan cannot be formulated, or to
recommend conversion to liquidation or to an individual repayment plan case, or dismissal. It is anticipated
that the trustee will consult with creditors and other parties in interest in the formulation of a plan, just as the
debtor in possession would.
Paragraph (6) [enacted as (7)] requires final reports by the trustee, as the court orders.
Subsection (b) gives the trustee's investigative duties to an examiner, if one is appointed. The court is
authorized to give the examiner additional duties as the circumstances warrant.
Paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of subsection (a) are derived from sections 165 and 169 of chapter X [sections
565 and 569 of former title 11].

102 Stat. 613, provided that:
"(a)(1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5), and notwithstanding title 11 of the United States Code,
the trustee shall pay benefits to retired former employees under a plan, fund, or program maintained or
established by the debtor prior to filing a petition (through the purchase of insurance or otherwise) for the
purpose of providing medical, surgical, or hospital care benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident,
disability, or death.
"(2) The level of benefits required to be paid by this subsection may be modified prior to confirmation of a
plan under section 1129 of such title if—
"(A) the trustee and an authorized representative of the former employees with respect to whom such
benefits are payable agree to the modification of such benefit payments; or
"(B) the court finds that a modification proposed by the trustee meets the standards of section
1113(b)(1)(A) of such title and the balance of the equities clearly favors the modification.
If such benefits are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the authorized representative shall be the
labor organization that is signatory to such collective bargaining agreement unless there is a conflict of
interest.
"(3) The trustee shall pay benefits in accordance with this subsection until—
"(A) the dismissal of the case involved; or
"(B) the effective date of a plan confirmed under section 1129 of such title which provides for the
continued payment after confirmation of the plan of all such benefits at the level established under
paragraph (2) of this subsection, at any time prior to the confirmation of the plan, for the duration of the
period the debtor (as defined in such title) has obligated itself to provide such benefits.
"(4) No such benefits paid between the filing of a petition in a case covered by this section and the time a
plan confirmed under section 1129 of such title with respect to such case becomes effective shall be deducted
or offset from the amount allowed as claims for any benefits which remain unpaid, or from the amount to be
paid under the plan with respect to such claims for unpaid benefits, whether such claims for unpaid benefits
are based upon or arise from a right to future benefits or from any benefit not paid as a result of modifications
allowed pursuant to this section.
"(5) No claim for benefits covered by this section shall be limited by section 502(b)(7) of such title.
"(b)(1) Notwithstanding any provision of title 11 of the United States Code, the trustee shall pay an
allowable claim of any person for a benefit paid—
"(A) before the filing of the petition under title 11 of the United States Code; and
"(B) directly or indirectly to a retired former employee under a plan, fund, or program described in
subsection (a)(1);
if, as determined by the court, such person is entitled to recover from such employee, or any provider of health
care to such employee, directly or indirectly, the amount of such benefit for which such person receives no
payment from the debtor.
"(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term 'provider of health care' means a person who—
"(A) is the direct provider of health care (including a physician, dentist, nurse, podiatrist, optometrist,
physician assistant, or ancillary personnel employed under the supervision of a physician); or
"(B) administers a facility or institution (including a hospital, alcohol and drug abuse treatment
facility, outpatient facility, or health maintenance organization) in which health care is provided.
"(c) This section is effective with respect to cases commenced under chapter 11, of title 11, United States
Code, in which a plan for reorganization has not been confirmed by the court and in which any such benefit is
still being paid on October 2, 1986, and in cases that become subject to chapter 11, title 11, United States
Code, after October 2, 1986 and before the date of the enactment of the Retiree Benefits Bankruptcy
Protection Act of 1988 [June 16, 1988].

This section places a debtor in possession in the shoes of a trustee in every way. The debtor is given the

trustee (except the investigative duties). He is also subject to any limitations on a chapter 11 trustee, and to
such other limitations and conditions as the court prescribes cf. Wolf v. Weinstein, 372 U.S. 633, 649–650

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
The House amendment adopts section 1108 of the House bill in preference to the style of an identical
substantive provision contained in the Senate amendment. Throughout title 11 references to a "trustee" is read
to include other parties under various sections of the bill. For example, section 1107 applies to give the debtor
in possession all the rights and powers of a trustee in a case under chapter 11; this includes the power of the
trustee to operate the debtor's business under section 1108.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section permits the debtor's business to continue to be operated, unless the court orders otherwise.
Thus, in a reorganization case, operation of the business will be the rule, and it will not be necessary to go to
the court to obtain an order authorizing operation.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
[Release Point 118-106]
This section does not presume that a trustee will be appointed to operate the business of the debtor. Rather,
the power granted to trustee under this section is one of the powers that a debtor in possession acquires by
virtue of proposed 11 U.S.C. 1107.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1109 of the House amendment represents a compromise between comparable provisions in the
House bill and Senate amendment. As previously discussed the section gives the Securities and Exchange
Commission the right to appear and be heard and to raise any issue in a case under chapter 11; however, the
Securities and Exchange Commission is not a party in interest and the Commission may not appeal from any
judgment, order, or decree entered in the case. Under section 1109(b) a party in interest, including the debtor,
the trustee, creditors committee, equity securities holders committee, a creditor, an equity security holder, or
an indentured trustee, may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in a case under chapter 11. Section
1109(c) of the Senate amendment has been moved to subchapter IV pertaining to Railroad Reorganizations.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) provides, in unqualified terms, that any creditor, equity security holder, or an indenture
trustee shall have the right to be heard as a party in interest under this chapter in person, by an attorney, or by
a committee. It is derived from section 206 of chapter X ([former] 11 U.S.C. 606).
Subsection (b) provides that the Securities and Exchange Commission may appear by filing an appearance
in a case of a public company and may appear in other cases if authorized or requested by the court. As a party
in interest in either case, the Commission may raise and be heard on any issue. The Commission may not
appeal from a judgment, order, or decree in a case, but may participate in any appeal by any other party in
interest. This is the present law under section 208 of chapter X ([former] 11 U.S.C. 608).
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Section 1109 authorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission and any indenture trustee to intervene in
the case at any time on any issue. They may raise an issue or may appear and be heard on an issue that is
raised by someone else. The section, following current law, denies the right of appeal to the Securities and
Exchange Commission. It does not, however, prevent the Commission from joining or participating in an
appeal taken by a true party in interest. The Commission is merely prevented from initiating the appeal in any
capacity.
[Release Point 118-106]
§1110. Aircraft equipment and vessels
(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) and subject to subsection (b), the right of a secured
party with a security interest in equipment described in paragraph (3), or of a lessor or conditional
vendor of such equipment, to take possession of such equipment in compliance with a security
agreement, lease, or conditional sale contract, and to enforce any of its other rights or remedies,
under such security agreement, lease, or conditional sale contract, to sell, lease, or otherwise retain or
dispose of such equipment, is not limited or otherwise affected by any other provision of this title or
by any power of the court.
(2) The right to take possession and to enforce the other rights and remedies described in
paragraph (1) shall be subject to section 362 if—
(A) before the date that is 60 days after the date of the order for relief under this chapter, the
trustee, subject to the approval of the court, agrees to perform all obligations of the debtor under
such security agreement, lease, or conditional sale contract; and
(B) any default, other than a default of a kind specified in section 365(b)(2), under such security
agreement, lease, or conditional sale contract—
(i) that occurs before the date of the order is cured before the expiration of such 60-day
period;
(ii) that occurs after the date of the order and before the expiration of such 60-day period is
cured before the later of—
(I) the date that is 30 days after the date of the default; or
(II) the expiration of such 60-day period; and
(iii) that occurs on or after the expiration of such 60-day period is cured in compliance with
the terms of such security agreement, lease, or conditional sale contract, if a cure is permitted
under that agreement, lease, or contract.
(3) The equipment described in this paragraph—
(A) is—
(i) an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, or spare part (as defined in section 40102
of title 49) that is subject to a security interest granted by, leased to, or conditionally sold to a
debtor that, at the time such transaction is entered into, holds an air carrier operating certificate
issued pursuant to chapter 447 of title 49 for aircraft capable of carrying 10 or more individuals
or 6,000 pounds or more of cargo; or
(ii) a vessel documented under chapter 121 of title 46 that is subject to a security interest
granted by, leased to, or conditionally sold to a debtor that is a water carrier that, at the time
such transaction is entered into, holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity or
permit issued by the Department of Transportation; and
(B) includes all records and documents relating to such equipment that are required, under the
terms of the security agreement, lease, or conditional sale contract, to be surrendered or returned
by the debtor in connection with the surrender or return of such equipment.
(4) Paragraph (1) applies to a secured party, lessor, or conditional vendor acting in its own behalf
or acting as trustee or otherwise in behalf of another party.
(b) The trustee and the secured party, lessor, or conditional vendor whose right to take possession
is protected under subsection (a) may agree, subject to the approval of the court, to extend the 60-day
period specified in subsection (a)(1).
(c)(1) In any case under this chapter, the trustee shall immediately surrender and return to a
secured party, lessor, or conditional vendor, described in subsection (a)(1), equipment described in
subsection (a)(3), if at any time after the date of the order for relief under this chapter such secured
party, lessor, or conditional vendor is entitled pursuant to subsection (a)(1) to take possession of such
equipment and makes a written demand for such possession to the trustee.
(2) At such time as the trustee is required under paragraph (1) to surrender and return equipment
[Release Point 118-106]
described in subsection (a)(3), any lease of such equipment, and any security agreement or
conditional sale contract relating to such equipment, if such security agreement or conditional sale
contract is an executory contract, shall be deemed rejected.
(d) With respect to equipment first placed in service on or before October 22, 1994, for purposes
of this section—
(1) the term "lease" includes any written agreement with respect to which the lessor and the
debtor, as lessee, have expressed in the agreement or in a substantially contemporaneous writing
that the agreement is to be treated as a lease for Federal income tax purposes; and
(2) the term "security interest" means a purchase-money equipment security interest.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1110 of the House amendment adopts an identical provision contained in the House bill without
modifications contained in the Senate amendment. This section protects a limited class of financiers of aircraft
and vessels and is intended to be narrowly construed to prevent secured parties or lessors from gaining the
protection of the section unless the interest of such lessor or secured party is explicitly enumerated therein. It
should be emphasized that under section 1110(a) a debtor in possession or trustee is given 60 days after the
order for relief in a case under chapter 11, to have an opportunity to comply with the provisions of section
1110(a).
During this time the automatic stay will apply and may not be lifted prior to the expiration of the 60-day
period. Under section 1110(b), the debtor and secured party or lessor are given an opportunity to extend the
60-day period, but no right to reduce the period is intended. It should additionally be noted that under section
1110(a) the trustee or debtor in possession is not required to assume the executory contract or unexpired lease
under section 1110; rather, if the trustee or debtor in possession complies with the requirements of section
1110(a), the trustee or debtor in possession is entitled to retain the aircraft or vessels subject to the normal
requirements of section 365. The discussion regarding aircraft and vessels likewise applies with respect to
railroad rolling stock in a railroad reorganization under section 1168.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section, to a large degree, preserves the protection given lessors and conditional vendors of aircraft to a
certificated air carrier or of vessels to a certificated water carrier under section 116(5) and 116(6) of present
Chapter X [section 516(5) and (6) of former title 11]. It is modified to conform with the consolidation of
Chapters X and XI [chapters 10 and 11 of former title 11] and with the new chapter 11 generally. It is also
modified to give the trustee in a reorganization case an opportunity to continue in possession of the equipment
in question by curing defaults and by making the required lease or purchase payments. This removes the
absolute veto power over a reorganization that lessors and conditional vendors have under present law, while
entitling them to protection of their investment.
The section overrides the automatic stay or any power of the court to enjoin taking of possession of certain
leased, conditionally sold, or liened equipment, unless, the trustee agrees to perform the debtor's obligations
and cures all prior defaults (other than defaults under ipso facto or bankruptcy clauses) within 60 days after
the order for relief. The trustee and the equipment financer are permitted to extend the 60-day period by
agreement. During the first 60 days, the automatic stay will apply to prevent foreclosure unless the creditor
gets relief from the stay.
The effect of this section will be the same if the debtor has granted the security interest to the financer or if
the debtor is leasing equipment from a financer that has leveraged the lease and leased the equipment subject
to a security interest of a third party.

"(a) The right of a secured party with a purchase-money equipment security interest in, or of a lessor or
conditional vendor of, whether as trustee or otherwise, aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, appliances, or
spare parts, as defined in section 40102(a) of title 49, or vessels of the United States, as defined in section
30101 of title 46, that are subject to a purchase-money equipment security interest granted by, leased to, or
conditionally sold to, a debtor that is an air carrier operating under a certificate of convenience and necessity
issued by the Secretary of Transportation, or a water carrier that holds a certificate of public convenience and
necessity or permit issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, as the case may be, to take possession of
such equipment in compliance with the provisions of a purchase-money equipment security agreement, lease,
or conditional sale contract, as the case may be, is not affected by section 362 or 363 of this title or by any
power of the court to enjoin such taking of possession, unless—
"(1) before 60 days after the date of the order for relief under this chapter, the trustee, subject to the
court's approval, agrees to perform all obligations of the debtor that become due on or after such date under
such security agreement, lease, or conditional sale contract, as the case may be; and
"(2) any default, other than a default of a kind specified in section 365(b)(2) of this title, under such
security agreement, lease, or conditional sale contract, as the case may be—
"(A) that occurred before such date is cured before the expiration of such 60-day period; and
"(B) that occurs after such date is cured before the later of—
"(i) 30 days after the date of such default; and
"(ii) the expiration of such 60-day period.
"(b) The trustee and the secured party, lessor, or conditional vendor, as the case may be, whose right to take
possession is protected under subsection (a) of this section may agree, subject to the court's approval, to
extend the 60-day period specified in subsection (a)(1) of this section."

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
A discussion of section 1111(b) of the House amendment is best considered in the context of confirmation
and will therefore, be discussed in connection with section 1129.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section dispenses with the need for every creditor and equity security holder to file a proof of claim or
interest in a reorganization case. Usually the debtor's schedules are accurate enough that they will suffice to
determine the claims or interests allowable in the case. Thus, the section specifies that any claim or interest
included on the debtor's schedules is deemed filed under section 501. This does not apply to claims or interests
that are scheduled as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated.

may convert a case under this chapter to a case under chapter 7 of this title or may dismiss a case
under this chapter, whichever is in the best interest of creditors and the estate if the debtor in a
voluntary case fails to file, within fifteen days after the filing of the petition commencing such case
or such additional time as the court may allow, the information required by paragraph (1) of section
521(a), including a list containing the names and addresses of the holders of the twenty largest

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1112 of the House amendment represents a compromise between the House bill and Senate
amendment with respect to the factors constituting cause for conversion of a case to chapter 7 or dismissal.
The House amendment combines two separate factors contained in section 1112(b)(1) and section 1112(b)(2)
of the Senate amendment. Section 1112(b)(1) of the House amendment permits the court to convert a case to a
case under chapter 7 or to dismiss the case if there is both a continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and
the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation; requiring both factors to be present simultaneously
represents a compromise from the House bill which eliminated both factors from the list of causes
enumerated.
Sections 1112(c) and 1112(d) of the House amendment is derived from the House bill which differs from
the Senate amendment only as a matter of style.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section brings together all of the conversion and dismissal rules for chapter 11 cases. Subsection (a)
gives the debtor an absolute right to convert a voluntarily commenced chapter 11 case in which the debtor
remains in possession to a liquidation case.
Subsection (b) gives wide discretion to the court to make an appropriate disposition of the case sua sponte
or upon motion of a party in interest, or the court is permitted to convert a reorganization case to a liquidation
case or to dismiss the case, whichever is in the best interest of creditors and the estate, but only for cause.
Cause may include the continuing loss to or dimunition [sic] of the estate of an insolvent debtor, the absence
of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation, the inability to effectuate a plan, unreasonable delay by the debtor
that is prejudicial to creditors, failure to file a plan within the appropriate time limits, denial of confirmation
and any opportunity to modify or propose a new plan, revocation of confirmation and denial of confirmation
of a modified plan, inability to effectuate substantial consummation of a confirmed plan, material default by
the debtor under the plan, and termination of the plan by reason of the occurrence of a condition specified in
the plan. This list is not exhaustive. The court will be able to consider other factors as they arise, and to use its
equitable powers to reach an appropriate result in individual cases. The power of the court to act sua sponte
should be used sparingly and only in emergency situations.
Subsection (c) prohibits the court from converting a case concerning a farmer or an eleemosynary
institution to a liquidation case unless the debtor consents.
Subsection (d) prohibits conversion of a reorganization case to a chapter 13 case unless the debtor requests
conversion and his discharge has not been granted or has been revoked.
Subsection (e) reinforces section 109 by prohibiting conversion of a chapter 11 case to a case under another
[Release Point 118-106]
chapter proceedings under which the debtor is not permitted to proceed.

§1113. Rejection of collective bargaining agreements
(a) The debtor in possession, or the trustee if one has been appointed under the provisions of this
chapter, other than a trustee in a case covered by subchapter IV of this chapter and by title I of the
Railway Labor Act, may assume or reject a collective bargaining agreement only in accordance with
the provisions of this section.
(b)(1) Subsequent to filing a petition and prior to filing an application seeking rejection of a
collective bargaining agreement, the debtor in possession or trustee (hereinafter in this section
"trustee" shall include a debtor in possession), shall—
(A) make a proposal to the authorized representative of the employees covered by such
agreement, based on the most complete and reliable information available at the time of such
proposal, which provides for those necessary modifications in the employees benefits and
protections that are necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor and assures that all
creditors, the debtor and all of the affected parties are treated fairly and equitably; and
(B) provide, subject to subsection (d)(3), the representative of the employees with such relevant
information as is necessary to evaluate the proposal.
(2) During the period beginning on the date of the making of a proposal provided for in paragraph
(1) and ending on the date of the hearing provided for in subsection (d)(1), the trustee shall meet, at
reasonable times, with the authorized representative to confer in good faith in attempting to reach
mutually satisfactory modifications of such agreement.
(c) The court shall approve an application for rejection of a collective bargaining agreement only
if the court finds that—
(1) the trustee has, prior to the hearing, made a proposal that fulfills the requirements of
subsection (b)(1);
(2) the authorized representative of the employees has refused to accept such proposal without
good cause; and
(3) the balance of the equities clearly favors rejection of such agreement.
(d)(1) Upon the filing of an application for rejection the court shall schedule a hearing to be held
not later than fourteen days after the date of the filing of such application. All interested parties may
appear and be heard at such hearing. Adequate notice shall be provided to such parties at least ten
days before the date of such hearing. The court may extend the time for the commencement of such
hearing for a period not exceeding seven days where the circumstances of the case, and the interests
of justice require such extension, or for additional periods of time to which the trustee and
representative agree.
(2) The court shall rule on such application for rejection within thirty days after the date of the
commencement of the hearing. In the interests of justice, the court may extend such time for ruling
for such additional period as the trustee and the employees' representative may agree to. If the court
does not rule on such application within thirty days after the date of the commencement of the
hearing, or within such additional time as the trustee and the employees' representative may agree to,
the trustee may terminate or alter any provisions of the collective bargaining agreement pending the
ruling of the court on such application.
(3) The court may enter such protective orders, consistent with the need of the authorized
representative of the employee to evaluate the trustee's proposal and the application for rejection, as
may be necessary to prevent disclosure of information provided to such representative where such
disclosure could compromise the position of the debtor with respect to its competitors in the industry
in which it is engaged.
(e) If during a period when the collective bargaining agreement continues in effect, and if essential
to the continuation of the debtor's business, or in order to avoid irreparable damage to the estate, the
[Release Point 118-106]
court, after notice and a hearing, may authorize the trustee to implement interim changes in the
terms, conditions, wages, benefits, or work rules provided by a collective bargaining agreement. Any
hearing under this paragraph shall be scheduled in accordance with the needs of the trustee. The
implementation of such interim changes shall not render the application for rejection moot.
(f) No provision of this title shall be construed to permit a trustee to unilaterally terminate or alter
any provisions of a collective bargaining agreement prior to compliance with the provisions of this
section.

dependents, for medical, surgical, or hospital care benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness,

benefits.
(c)(1) A labor organization shall be, for purposes of this section, the authorized representative of
those persons receiving any retiree benefits covered by any collective bargaining agreement to which
that labor organization is signatory, unless (A) such labor organization elects not to serve as the
authorized representative of such persons, or (B) the court, upon a motion by any party in interest,
after notice and hearing, determines that different representation of such persons is appropriate.
(2) In cases where the labor organization referred to in paragraph (1) elects not to serve as the
authorized representative of those persons receiving any retiree benefits covered by any collective
bargaining agreement to which that labor organization is signatory, or in cases where the court,
pursuant to paragraph (1) finds different representation of such persons appropriate, the court, upon a
motion by any party in interest, and after notice and a hearing, shall appoint a committee of retired
[Release Point 118-106]
employees if the debtor seeks to modify or not pay the retiree benefits or if the court otherwise
determines that it is appropriate, from among such persons, to serve as the authorized representative
of such persons under this section.
(d) The court, upon a motion by any party in interest, and after notice and a hearing, shall order
the appointment of a committee of retired employees if the debtor seeks to modify or not pay the
retiree benefits or if the court otherwise determines that it is appropriate, to serve as the authorized
representative, under this section, of those persons receiving any retiree benefits not covered by a
collective bargaining agreement. The United States trustee shall appoint any such committee.
(e)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the debtor in possession, or the trustee if
one has been appointed under the provisions of this chapter (hereinafter in this section "trustee" shall
include a debtor in possession), shall timely pay and shall not modify any retiree benefits, except
that—
(A) the court, on motion of the trustee or authorized representative, and after notice and a
hearing, may order modification of such payments, pursuant to the provisions of subsections (g)
and (h) of this section, or
(B) the trustee and the authorized representative of the recipients of those benefits may agree to
modification of such payments,
after which such benefits as modified shall continue to be paid by the trustee.
(2) Any payment for retiree benefits required to be made before a plan confirmed under section
1129 of this title is effective has the status of an allowed administrative expense as provided in
section 503 of this title.
(f)(1) Subsequent to filing a petition and prior to filing an application seeking modification of the
retiree benefits, the trustee shall—
(A) make a proposal to the authorized representative of the retirees, based on the most complete
and reliable information available at the time of such proposal, which provides for those necessary
modifications in the retiree benefits that are necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor
and assures that all creditors, the debtor and all of the affected parties are treated fairly and
equitably; and
(B) provide, subject to subsection (k)(3), the representative of the retirees with such relevant
information as is necessary to evaluate the proposal.
(2) During the period beginning on the date of the making of a proposal provided for in paragraph
(1), and ending on the date of the hearing provided for in subsection (k)(1), the trustee shall meet, at
reasonable times, with the authorized representative to confer in good faith in attempting to reach
mutually satisfactory modifications of such retiree benefits.
(g) The court shall enter an order providing for modification in the payment of retiree benefits if
the court finds that—
(1) the trustee has, prior to the hearing, made a proposal that fulfills the requirements of
subsection (f);
(2) the authorized representative of the retirees has refused to accept such proposal without
good cause; and
(3) such modification is necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor and assures that all
creditors, the debtor, and all of the affected parties are treated fairly and equitably, and is clearly
favored by the balance of the equities;
except that in no case shall the court enter an order providing for such modification which
provides for a modification to a level lower than that proposed by the trustee in the proposal found
by the court to have complied with the requirements of this subsection and subsection (f): Provided,
however, That at any time after an order is entered providing for modification in the payment of
retiree benefits, or at any time after an agreement modifying such benefits is made between the
trustee and the authorized representative of the recipients of such benefits, the authorized
representative may apply to the court for an order increasing those benefits which order shall be
[Release Point 118-106]
granted if the increase in retiree benefits sought is consistent with the standard set forth in paragraph
(3): Provided further, That neither the trustee nor the authorized representative is precluded from
making more than one motion for a modification order governed by this subsection.
(h)(1) Prior to a court issuing a final order under subsection (g) of this section, if essential to the
continuation of the debtor's business, or in order to avoid irreparable damage to the estate, the court,
after notice and a hearing, may authorize the trustee to implement interim modifications in retiree
benefits.
(2) Any hearing under this subsection shall be scheduled in accordance with the needs of the
trustee.
(3) The implementation of such interim changes does not render the motion for modification moot.
(i) No retiree benefits paid between the filing of the petition and the time a plan confirmed under
section 1129 of this title becomes effective shall be deducted or offset from the amounts allowed as
claims for any benefits which remain unpaid, or from the amounts to be paid under the plan with
respect to such claims for unpaid benefits, whether such claims for unpaid benefits are based upon or
arise from a right to future unpaid benefits or from any benefits not paid as a result of modifications
allowed pursuant to this section.
(j) No claim for retiree benefits shall be limited by section 502(b)(7) of this title.
(k)(1) Upon the filing of an application for modifying retiree benefits, the court shall schedule a
hearing to be held not later than fourteen days after the date of the filing of such application. All
interested parties may appear and be heard at such hearing. Adequate notice shall be provided to
such parties at least ten days before the date of such hearing. The court may extend the time for the
commencement of such hearing for a period not exceeding seven days where the circumstances of
the case, and the interests of justice require such extension, or for additional periods of time to which
the trustee and the authorized representative agree.
(2) The court shall rule on such application for modification within ninety days after the date of
the commencement of the hearing. In the interests of justice, the court may extend such time for
ruling for such additional period as the trustee and the authorized representative may agree to. If the
court does not rule on such application within ninety days after the date of the commencement of the
hearing, or within such additional time as the trustee and the authorized representative may agree to,
the trustee may implement the proposed modifications pending the ruling of the court on such
application.
(3) The court may enter such protective orders, consistent with the need of the authorized
representative of the retirees to evaluate the trustee's proposal and the application for modification, as
may be necessary to prevent disclosure of information provided to such representative where such
disclosure could compromise the position of the debtor with respect to its competitors in the industry
in which it is engaged.
(l) If the debtor, during the 180-day period ending on the date of the filing of the petition—
(1) modified retiree benefits; and
(2) was insolvent on the date such benefits were modified;
the court, on motion of a party in interest, and after notice and a hearing, shall issue an order
reinstating as of the date the modification was made, such benefits as in effect immediately before
such date unless the court finds that the balance of the equities clearly favors such modification.
(m) This section shall not apply to any retiree, or the spouse or dependents of such retiree, if such
retiree's gross income for the twelve months preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition equals or
exceeds $250,000, unless such retiree can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court that he is
unable to obtain health, medical, life, and disability coverage for himself, his spouse, and his
dependents who would otherwise be covered by the employer's insurance plan, comparable to the
coverage provided by the employer on the day before the filing of a petition under this title.

cause reduce or increase the 120-day period or the 180-day period referred to in this section.
(2)(A) The 120-day period specified in paragraph (1) may not be extended beyond a date that is 18

SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) permits the debtor to file a reorganization plan with a petition commencing a voluntary case
or at any time during a voluntary or involuntary case.
Subsection (b) gives the debtor the exclusive right to file a plan during the first 120 days of the case. There
are exceptions, however, enumerated in subsection (c). If a trustee has been appointed, if the debtor does not
meet the 120-day deadline, or if the debtor fails to obtain the required consent within 180 days after the filing
of the petition, any party in interest may propose a plan. This includes the debtor, the trustee, a creditors'
committee, an equity security holders' committee, a creditor, an equity security holder, and an indenture
trustee. The list is not exhaustive. In the case of a public company, a trustee is appointed within 10 days of the
petition. In such a case, for all practical purposes, any party in interest may file a plan.
Subsection (d) permits the court, for cause, to increase or reduce the 120-day and 180-day periods specified.
Since, the debtor has an exclusive privilege for 6 months during which others may not file a plan, the granted
extension should be based on a showing of some promise of probable success. An extension should not be

employed as a tactical device to put pressure on parties in interest to yield to a plan they consider
unsatisfactory.

possessing voting power, an appropriate distribution of such power among such classes, including,

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1123 of the House amendment represents a compromise between similar provisions in the House
bill and Senate amendment. The section has been clarified to clearly indicate that both secured and unsecured
claims, or either of them, may be impaired in a case under title 11. In addition assumption or rejection of an
executory contract under a plan must comply with section 365 of title 11. Moreover, section 1123(a)(1) has
been substantively modified to permit classification of certain kinds of priority claims. This is important for
purposes of confirmation under section 1129(a)(9).
Section 1123(a)(5) of the House amendment is derived from a similar provision in the House bill and
Senate amendment but deletes the language pertaining to "fair upset price" as an unnecessary restriction.
Section 1123 is also intended to indicate that a plan may provide for any action specified in section 1123 in
the case of a corporation without a resolution of the board of directors. If the plan is confirmed, then any
action proposed in the plan may be taken notwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law in
accordance with section 1142(a) of title 11.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) specifies what a plan of reorganization must contain. The plan must designate classes of
claims and interests, and specify, by class, the claims or interests that are unimpaired under the plan. Priority
claims are not required to be classified because they may not have arisen when the plan is filed. The plan must
provide the same treatment for each claim or interest of a particular class, unless the holder of a particular
claim or interest agrees to a different, but not better, treatment of his claim or interest.
Paragraph (3) applies to claims, not creditors. Thus, if a creditor is undersecured, and thus has a secured
claim and an unsecured claim, this paragraph will be applied independently to each of his claims.
Paragraph (4) of subsection (a) is derived from section 216 of chapter X [section 616 of former title 11]
with some modifications. It requires the plan to provide adequate means for the plans execution. These means
may include retention by the debtor of all or any part of the property of the estate, transfer of all or any part of
[Release Point 118-106]
the property of the estate to one or more entities, whether organized pre- or postconfirmation, merger or
consolidation of the debtor with one or more persons, sale and distribution of all or any part of the property of
the estate, satisfaction or modification of any lien, cancellation or modification of any indenture or similar
instrument, curing or waiving of any default, extension of maturity dates or change in interest rates of
securities, amendment of the debtor's charter, and issuance of securities.
Subparagraph (C), as it applies in railroad cases, has the effect of overruling St. Joe Paper Co. v. Atlantic
Coast Line R. R., 347 U.S. 298 (1954). It will allow the trustee or creditors to propose a plan of merger with
another railroad without the consent of the debtor, and the debtor will be bound under proposed 11 U.S.C.
1141(a). See Hearings, pt. 3, at 1616. "Similar instrument" referred to in subparagraph (F) might include a
deposit with an agent for distribution, other than an indenture trustee, such as an agent under an agreement in
a railroad conditional sale or lease financing agreement.
Paragraphs (5) and (6) and subsection (b) are derived substantially from Section 216 of Chapter X ([former]
11 U.S.C. 616). Paragraph (5) requires the plan to prohibit the issuance of nonvoting equity securities, and to
provide for an appropriate distribution of voting power among the various classes of equity securities.
Paragraph (6) requires that the plan contain only provisions that are consistent with the interests of creditors
and equity security holders, and with public policy with respect to the selection of officers, directors, and
trustees, and their successors.
Subsection (b) specifies the matters that the plan may propose. The plan may impair or leave unimpaired
any claim or interest. The plan may provide for the assumption or rejection of executory contracts or
unexpired leases not previously rejected under section 365. The plan may also provide for the treatment of
claims by the debtor against other entities that are not settled before the confirmation of the plan. The plan
may propose settlement or adjustment of any claim or equity security belonging to the estate, or may propose
retention and enforcement of such claim or interest by the debtor or by an agent appointed for that purpose.
The plan may also propose the sale of all or substantially all of the property of the estate, and the
distribution of the proceeds of the sale among creditors and equity security holders. This would be a
liquidating plan. The subsection permits the plan to include any other appropriate provision not inconsistent
with the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code.
Subsection (c) protects an individual debtor's exempt property by prohibiting its use, sale, or lease under a
plan proposed by someone other than the debtor, unless the debtor consents.

any reasonable reliance by such holder on such contractual provision or such applicable law;
(D) if such claim or such interest arises from any failure to perform a nonmonetary

lease subject to section 365(b)(1)(A), compensates the holder of such claim or such interest
(other than the debtor or an insider) for any actual pecuniary loss incurred by such holder as a
result of such failure; and

interest entitles the holder of such claim or interest.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1124 of the House amendment is derived from a similar provision in the House bill and Senate
amendment. The section defines the new concept of "impairment" of claims or interests; the concept differs
significantly from the concept of "materially and adversely affected" under the Bankruptcy Act [former title
11]. Section 1124(3) of the House amendment provides that a holder of a claim or interest is not impaired, if
the plan provides that the holder will receive the allowed amount of the holder's claim, or in the case of an
interest with a fixed liquidation preference or redemption price, the greater of such price. This adopts the
position contained in the House bill and rejects the contrary standard contained in the Senate amendment.
Section 1124(3) of the House amendment rejects a provision contained in section 1124(3)(B)(iii) of the
House bill which would have considered a class of interest not to be impaired by virtue of the fact that the
plan provided cash or property for the value of the holder's interest in the debtor.
The effect of the House amendment is to permit an interest not to be impaired only if the interest has a fixed
liquidation preference or redemption price. Therefore, a class of interests such as common stock, must either
accept a plan under section 1129(a)(8), or the plan must satisfy the requirements of section 1129(b)(2)(C) in
order for a plan to be confirmed.
A compromise reflected in section 1124(2)(C) of the House amendment indicates that a class of claims is
[Release Point 118-106]
not impaired under the circumstances of section 1124(2) if damages are paid to rectify reasonable reliance
engaged in by the holder of a claim or interest arising from the prepetition breach of a contractual provision,
such as an ipso facto or bankruptcy clause, or law. Where the rights of third parties are concerned, such as in
the case of lease premises which have been rerented to a third party, it is not intended that there will be
adequate damages to compensate the third party.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
The basic concept underlying this section is not new. It rests essentially on Section 107 of Chapter X
([former] 11 U.S.C. 507), which states that creditors or stockholders or any class thereof "shall be deemed to
be 'affected' by a plan only if their or its interest shall be materially and adversely affected thereby."
This section is designated to indicate when contractual rights of creditors or interest holders are not
materially affected. It specifies three ways in which the plan may leave a claim or interest unimpaired.
First, the plan may propose not to alter the legal, equitable, or contractual rights to which the claim or
interest entitled its holder.
Second, a claim or interest is unimpaired by curing the effect of a default and reinstating the original terms
of an obligation when maturity was brought on or accelerated by the default. The intervention of bankruptcy
and the defaults represent a temporary crisis which the plan of reorganization is intended to clear away. The
holder of a claim or interest who under the plan is restored to his original position, when others receive less or
get nothing at all, is fortunate indeed and has no cause to complain. Curing of the default and the assumption
of the debt in accordance with its terms is an important reorganization technique for dealing with a particular
class of claims, especially secured claims.
Third, a claim or interest is unimpaired if the plan provides for their payment in cash. In the case of a debt
liability, the cash payment is for the allowed amount of the claim, which does not include a redemption
premium. If it is an equity security with a fixed liquidation preference, such as a preferred stock, the allowed
amount is such liquidation preference, with no redemption premium. With respect to any other equity security,
such as a common stock, cash payment must be equal to the "value of such holder's interest in the debtor."
Section 1124 does not include payment "in property" other than cash. Except for a rare case, claims or
interests are not by their terms payable in property, but a plan may so provide and those affected thereby may
accept or reject the proposed plan. They may not be forced to accept a plan declaring the holders' claims or
interests to be "unimpaired."
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
This section is new. It is designed to indicate when contractual rights of creditors or interest holders are not
materially affected. The section specifies three ways in which the plan may leave a claim or interest
unimpaired.
First, the plan may propose not to alter the legal, equitable, or contractual rights to which the claim or
interest entitled its holder.
Second, the plan is permitted to reinstate a claim or interest and thus leave it unimpaired. Reinstatement
consists of curing any default (other than a default under an ipso facto or bankruptcy clause) and reinstatement
of the maturity of the claim or interest. Further, the plan may not otherwise alter any legal, equitable, or
contractual right to which the claim or interest entitles its holder.
Third, the plan may leave a claim or interest unimpaired by paying its amount in full other than in securities
of the debtor, an affiliate of the debtor participating in a joint plan, or a successor to the debtor. These
securities are excluded because determination of their value would require a valuation of the business being
reorganized. Use of them to pay a creditor or equity security holder without his consent may be done only
under section 1129(b) and only after a valuation of the debtor. Under this paragraph, the plan must pay the
allowed amount of the claim in full, in cash or other property, or, in the case of an equity security, must pay
the greatest of any fixed liquidation preference to which the terms of the equity security entitle its holder, any
fixed price at which the debtor, under the terms of the equity security may redeem such equity security, and
the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of the holder's interest in the debtor. The value of the holder's
interest need not be determined precisely by valuing the debtor's business if such value is clearly below
redemption or liquidation preference values. If such value would require a full-scale valuation of the business,
then such interest should be treated as impaired. But, if the debtor corporation is clearly insolvent, then the
value of the common stock holder's interest in the debtor is zero, and offering them nothing under the plan of
reorganization will not impair their rights.
"Value, as of the effective date of the plan," as used in paragraph (3) and in proposed 11 U.S.C.
1179(a)(7)(B), 1129(a)(9), 1129(b), 1172(2), 1325(a)(4), 1325(a)(5)(B), and 1328(b), indicates that the
[Release Point 118-106]
promised payment under the plan must be discounted to present value as of the effective date of the plan. The
discounting should be based only on the unpaid balance of the amount due under the plan, until that amount,
including interest, is paid in full.

§1125. Postpetition disclosure and solicitation
(a) In this section—
(1) "adequate information" means information of a kind, and in sufficient detail, as far as is
reasonably practicable in light of the nature and history of the debtor and the condition of the
debtor's books and records, including a discussion of the potential material Federal tax
consequences of the plan to the debtor, any successor to the debtor, and a hypothetical investor
typical of the holders of claims or interests in the case, that would enable such a hypothetical
investor of the relevant class to make an informed judgment about the plan, but adequate
information need not include such information about any other possible or proposed plan and in
determining whether a disclosure statement provides adequate information, the court shall
consider the complexity of the case, the benefit of additional information to creditors and other
parties in interest, and the cost of providing additional information; and
(2) "investor typical of holders of claims or interests of the relevant class" means investor
[Release Point 118-106]
having—
(A) a claim or interest of the relevant class;
(B) such a relationship with the debtor as the holders of other claims or interests of such class
generally have; and
(C) such ability to obtain such information from sources other than the disclosure required by
this section as holders of claims or interests in such class generally have.
(b) An acceptance or rejection of a plan may not be solicited after the commencement of the case
under this title from a holder of a claim or interest with respect to such claim or interest, unless, at
the time of or before such solicitation, there is transmitted to such holder the plan or a summary of
the plan, and a written disclosure statement approved, after notice and a hearing, by the court as
containing adequate information. The court may approve a disclosure statement without a valuation
of the debtor or an appraisal of the debtor's assets.
(c) The same disclosure statement shall be transmitted to each holder of a claim or interest of a
particular class, but there may be transmitted different disclosure statements, differing in amount,
detail, or kind of information, as between classes.
(d) Whether a disclosure statement required under subsection (b) of this section contains adequate
information is not governed by any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law, rule, or regulation, but
an agency or official whose duty is to administer or enforce such a law, rule, or regulation may be
heard on the issue of whether a disclosure statement contains adequate information. Such an agency
or official may not appeal from, or otherwise seek review of, an order approving a disclosure
statement.
(e) A person that solicits acceptance or rejection of a plan, in good faith and in compliance with
the applicable provisions of this title, or that participates, in good faith and in compliance with the
applicable provisions of this title, in the offer, issuance, sale, or purchase of a security, offered or
sold under the plan, of the debtor, of an affiliate participating in a joint plan with the debtor, or of a
newly organized successor to the debtor under the plan, is not liable, on account of such solicitation
or participation, for violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation governing solicitation of
acceptance or rejection of a plan or the offer, issuance, sale, or purchase of securities.
(f) Notwithstanding subsection (b), in a small business case—
(1) the court may determine that the plan itself provides adequate information and that a
separate disclosure statement is not necessary;
(2) the court may approve a disclosure statement submitted on standard forms approved by the
court or adopted under section 2075 of title 28; and
(3)(A) the court may conditionally approve a disclosure statement subject to final approval after
notice and a hearing;
(B) acceptances and rejections of a plan may be solicited based on a conditionally approved
disclosure statement if the debtor provides adequate information to each holder of a claim or
interest that is solicited, but a conditionally approved disclosure statement shall be mailed not later
than 25 days before the date of the hearing on confirmation of the plan; and
(C) the hearing on the disclosure statement may be combined with the hearing on confirmation
of a plan.
(g) Notwithstanding subsection (b), an acceptance or rejection of the plan may be solicited from a
holder of a claim or interest if such solicitation complies with applicable nonbankruptcy law and if
such holder was solicited before the commencement of the case in a manner complying with
applicable nonbankruptcy law.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
[Release Point 118-106]
Section 1125 of the House amendment is derived from section 1125 of the House bill and Senate
amendment except with respect to section 1125(f) of the Senate amendment. It will not be necessary for the
court to consider the report of the examiner prior to approval of a disclosure statement. The investigation of
the examiner is to proceed on an independent basis from the procedure of the reorganization under chapter 11.
In order to ensure that the examiner's report will be expeditious and fair, the examiner is precluded from
serving as a trustee in the case or from representing a trustee if a trustee is appointed, whether the case
remains in chapter 11 or is converted to chapter 7 or 13.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section extends disclosure requirements in connection with solicitations to all cases under chapter 11.
Heretofore this subject was dealt with by the Bankruptcy Act [former title 11] mainly in the special contexts
of railroad reorganizations and chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11] cases.
Subsection (a) defines (1) the subject matter of disclosure as "adequate information" and relates the
standard of adequacy to an (2) "investor typical of holders or claims or interests of the relevant class."
"Investor" is used broadly here, for it will almost always include a trade creditor or other creditors who
originally had no investment intent or interest. It refers to the investment-type decision by those called upon to
accept a plan to modify their claims or interests, which typically will involve acceptance of new securities or
of a cash payment in lieu thereof.
Both the kind and form of information are left essentially to the judicial discretion of the court, guided by
the specification in subparagraph (a)(1) that it be of a kind and in sufficient detail that a reasonable and typical
investor can make an informed judgment about the plan. The information required will necessarily be
governed by the circumstances of the case.
Reporting and audit standards devised for solvent and continuing businesses do not necessarily fit a debtor
in reorganization. Subsection (a)(1) expressly incorporates consideration of the nature and history of the
debtor and the condition of its books and records into the determination of what is reasonably practicable to
supply. These factors are particularly pertinent to historical data and to discontinued operations of no future
relevance.
A plan is necessarily predicated on knowledge of the assets and liabilities being dealt with and on factually
supported expectations as to the future course of the business sufficient to meet the feasibility standard in
section 1130(a)(11) of this title. It may thus be necessary to provide estimates or judgments for that purpose.
Yet it remains practicable to describe, in such detail as may be relevant and needed, the basis for the plan and
the data on which supporters of the plan rely.
Subsection (b) establishes the jurisdiction of the court over this subject by prohibiting solicitation of
acceptance or rejection of a plan after the commencement of the case, unless the person solicited receives,
before or at the time of the solicitation, a written disclosure statement approved by the court, after notice and
hearing, as containing adequate information. As under present law, determinations of value, by appraisal or
otherwise, are not required if not needed to accomplish the purpose specified in subsection (a)(1).
Subsection (c) requires that the same disclosure statement be transmitted to each member of a class. It
recognizes that the information needed for an informed judgment about the plan may differ among classes. A
class whose rights under the plan center on a particular fund or asset would have no use for an extensive
description of other matters that could not affect them.
Subsection (d) relieves the court of the need to follow any otherwise applicable Federal or state law in
determining the adequacy of the information contained in the disclosure statement submitted for its approval.
It authorizes an agency or official, Federal or state, charged with administering cognate laws so preempted to
advise the court on the adequacy of proposed disclosure statement. But they are not authorized to appeal the
court's decision.
Solicitations with respect to a plan do not involve just mere requests for opinions. Acceptance of the plan
vitally affects creditors and shareholders, and most frequently the solicitation involves an offering of securities
in exchange for claims or interests. The present bankruptcy statute [former title 11] has exempted such
offerings under each of its chapters from the registration and disclosure requirements of the Securities Act of
1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.], an exemption also continued by section 1145(a)(2) of this title. The extension of
the disclosure requirements to all chapter 11 cases justifies the coordinate extension of these exemptions. By
the same token, no valid purpose is served not to exempt from the requirements of similar state laws in a
matter under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal bankruptcy laws.
Subsection (e) exonerates any person who, in good faith and in compliance with this title, solicits or
participates in the offer, issuance, sale or purchase, under the plan, of a security from any liability, on account
[Release Point 118-106]
of such solicitation or participation, for violation of any law, rule, or regulation governing the offer, issuance,
sale, or purchase of securities. This exoneration is coordinate with the exemption from Federal or State
registration or licensing requirements provided by section 1145 of this title.
In the nonpublic case, the court, when approving the disclosure statement, has before it the texts of the plan,
a proposed disclosure document, and such other information the plan proponents and other interested parties
may present at the hearing. In the final analysis the exoneration which subsection (e) grants must depend on
the good faith of the plan proponents and of those who participate in the preparation of the disclosure
statement and in the solicitation. Subsection (e) does not affect civil or criminal liability for defects and
inadequacies that are beyond the limits of the exoneration that good faith provides.
Section 1125 applies to public companies as well, subject to the qualifications of subsection (f). In case of a
public company no solicitations of acceptance is permitted unless authorized by the court upon or after
approval of the plan pursuant to section 1128(c). In addition to the documents specified in subsection (b),
subsection (f) requires transmission of the opinion and order of the court approving the plan and, if filed, the
advisory report of the Securities and Exchange Commission or a summary thereof prepared by the
Commission.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
This section is new. It is the heart of the consolidation of the various reorganization chapters found in
current law. It requires disclosure before solicitation of acceptances of a plan or reorganization.
Subsection (a) contains two definitions. First, "adequate information" is defined to mean information of a
kind, and insufficient detail, as far as is reasonably practical in light of the nature and history of the debtor and
the condition of the debtor's books and records, that would enable a hypothetical reasonable investor typical of
holders of claims or interests of the relevant class to make an informed judgment about the plan. Second,
"investor typical of holders of claims or interests of the relevant class" is defined to mean an investor having a
claim or interest of the relevant class, having such a relationship with the debtor as the holders of other claims
or interests of the relevant class have, and having such ability to obtain information from sources other than
the disclosure statement as holders of claims or interests of the relevant class have, and having such ability to
obtain information from sources other than the disclosure statement as holders of claims or interests of the
relevant class have. That is, the hypothetical investor against which the disclosure is measured must not be an
insider if other members of the class are not insiders, and so on. In other words, the adequacy of disclosure is
measured against the typical investor, not an extraordinary one.
The Supreme Court's rulemaking power will not extend to rulemaking that will prescribe what constitutes
adequate information. That standard is a substantive standard. Precisely what constitutes adequate information
in any particular instance will develop on a case-by-case basis. Courts will take a practical approach as to
what is necessary under the circumstances of each case, such as the cost of preparation of the statements, the
need for relative speed in solicitation and confirmation, and, of course, the need for investor protection. There
will be a balancing of interests in each case. In reorganization cases, there is frequently great uncertainty.
Therefore the need for flexibility is greatest.
Subsection (b) is the operative subsection. It prohibits solicitation of acceptances or rejections of a plan
after the commencement of the case unless, at the time of the solicitation or before, there is transmitted to the
solicitee the plan or a summary of the plan, and a written disclosure statement approved by the court as
containing adequate information. The subsection permits approval of the statement without the necessity of a
valuation of the debtor or an appraisal of the debtor's assets. However, in some cases, a valuation or appraisal
will be necessary to develop adequate information. The court will be able to determine what is necessary in
light of the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
Subsection (c) requires that the same disclosure statement go to all members of a particular class, but
permits different disclosure to different classes.
Subsection (d) excepts the disclosure statements from the requirements of the securities laws (such as
section 14 of the 1934 Act [15 U.S.C. 78n] and section 5 of the 1933 Act [15 U.S.C. 77e]), and from similar
State securities laws (blue sky laws, for example). The subsection permits an agency or official whose duty is
to administer or enforce such laws (such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or State Corporation
Commissioners) to appear and be heard on the issue of whether a disclosure statement contains adequate
information, but the agencies and officials are not granted the right of appeal from an adverse determination in
any capacity. They may join in an appeal by a true party in interest, however.
Subsection (e) is a safe harbor provision, and is necessary to make the exemption provided by subsection
(d) effective. Without it, a creditor that solicited an acceptance or rejection in reliance on the court's approval
of a disclosure statement would be potentially liable under antifraud sections designed to enforce the very
sections of the securities laws from which subsection (d) excuses compliance. The subsection protects only
[Release Point 118-106]
persons that solicit in good faith and in compliance with the applicable provisions of the reorganization
chapter. It provides protection from legal liability as well as from equitable liability based on an injunctive
action by the SEC or other agency or official.

(1) the solicitation of such acceptance or rejection was in compliance with any applicable
nonbankruptcy law, rule, or regulation governing the adequacy of disclosure in connection with

entity whose acceptance or rejection of such plan was not in good faith, or was not solicited or
procured in good faith or in accordance with the provisions of this title.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a class that is not impaired under a plan,
and each holder of a claim or interest of such class, are conclusively presumed to have accepted the
plan, and solicitation of acceptances with respect to such class from the holders of claims or interests
of such class is not required.
(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a class is deemed not to have accepted a
plan if such plan provides that the claims or interests of such class do not entitle the holders of such
claims or interests to receive or retain any property under the plan on account of such claims or
interests.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1126 of the House amendment deletes section 1126(e) as contained in the House bill. Section 105
of the bill constitutes sufficient power in the court to designate exclusion of a creditor's claim on the basis of a
conflict of interest. Section 1126(f) of the House amendment adopts a provision contained in section 1127(f)
of the Senate bill indicating that a class that is not impaired under a plan is deemed to have accepted a plan
and solicitation of acceptances from such class is not required.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) of this section permits the holder of a claim or interest allowed under section 502 to accept
or reject a proposed plan of reorganization. The subsection also incorporates a provision now found in section
199 of chapter X [section 599 of former title 11] that authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to accept or
reject a plan on behalf of the United States when the United States is a creditor or equity security holder.
Subsection (b) governs acceptances and rejections of plans obtained before commencement of a
reorganization for a nonpublic company. Paragraph (3) expressly states that subsection (b) does not apply to a
public company.
Prepetition solicitation is a common practice under chapter XI [chapter 11 of former title 11] today, and
chapter IX [chapter 9 of former title 11] current makes explicit provision for it. Section 1126(b) counts a
prepetition acceptance or rejection toward the required amounts and number of acceptances only if the
solicitation of the acceptance or rejection was in compliance with any applicable nonbankruptcy law, rule, or
regulation governing the adequacy of disclosure in connection with such solicitation. If there is not any such
[Release Point 118-106]
applicable law, rule, or regulation, then the acceptance or rejection is counted only if it was solicited after
disclosure of adequate information, to the holder, as defined in section 1125(a)(1). This permits the court to
ensure that the requirements of section 1125 are not avoided by prepetition solicitation.
Subsection (c) specifies the required amount and number of acceptances for a class of creditors. A class of
creditors has accepted a plan if at least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of the allowed
claims of the class that are voted are cast in favor of the plan. The amount and number are computed on the
basis of claims actually voted for or against the plan, not as under chapter X [chapter 10 of former title 11] on
the basis of the allowed claims in the class. Subsection (f) excludes from all these calculations claims not
voted in good faith, and claims procured or solicited not in good faith or not in accordance with the provisions
of this title.
Subsection (c) requires that the same disclosure statement be transmitted to each member of a class. It
recognizes that the information needed for an informed judgment about the plan may differ among classes. A
class whose rights under the plan center on a particular fund or asset would have no use for an extensive
description of other matters that could not affect them.
Subsection (d) relieves the court of the need to follow any otherwise applicable Federal or state law in
determining the adequacy of the information contained in the disclosure statement submitted for its approval.
It authorizes an agency or official, Federal or state, charged with administering cognate laws so pre-empted to
advise the court on the adequacy of proposed disclosure statement. But they are not authorized to appeal the
court's decision.
Solicitations with respect to a plan do not involve just mere requests for opinions. Acceptance of the plan
vitally affects creditors and shareholders, and most frequently the solicitation involves an offering of securities
in exchange for claims or interests. The present Bankruptcy Act [former title 11] has exempted such offerings
under each of its chapters from the registration and disclosure requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 [15
U.S.C. 77a et seq.], an exemption also continued by section 1145 of this title. The extension of the disclosure
requirements to all chapter 11 cases is justified by the integration of the separate chapters into the single
chapter 11. By the same token, no valid purpose is served by failing to provide exemption from the
requirements of similar state laws in a matter under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal bankruptcy laws.
Under subsection (d), with respect to a class of equity securities, it is sufficient for acceptance of the plan if
the amount of securities voting for the plan is at least two-thirds of the total actually voted.
Subsection (e) provides that no acceptances are required from any class whose claims or interests are
unimpaired under the plan or in the order confirming the plan.
Subsection (g) provides that any class denied participation under the plan is conclusively deemed to have
rejected the plan. There is obviously no need to submit a plan for a vote by a class that is to receive nothing.
But under subsection (g) the excluded class is like a class that has not accepted, and is a dissenting class for
purposes of confirmation under section 1130.

552(a) of Pub. L. 98–353, set out as a note under section 101 of this title.
§1127. Modification of plan
(a) The proponent of a plan may modify such plan at any time before confirmation, but may not
modify such plan so that such plan as modified fails to meet the requirements of sections 1122 and
[Release Point 118-106]
1123 of this title. After the proponent of a plan files a modification of such plan with the court, the
plan as modified becomes the plan.
(b) The proponent of a plan or the reorganized debtor may modify such plan at any time after
confirmation of such plan and before substantial consummation of such plan, but may not modify
such plan so that such plan as modified fails to meet the requirements of sections 1122 and 1123 of
this title. Such plan as modified under this subsection becomes the plan only if circumstances
warrant such modification and the court, after notice and a hearing, confirms such plan as modified,
under section 1129 of this title.
(c) The proponent of a modification shall comply with section 1125 of this title with respect to the
plan as modified.
(d) Any holder of a claim or interest that has accepted or rejected a plan is deemed to have
accepted or rejected, as the case may be, such plan as modified, unless, within the time fixed by the
court, such holder changes such holder's previous acceptance or rejection.
(e) If the debtor is an individual, the plan may be modified at any time after confirmation of the
plan but before the completion of payments under the plan, whether or not the plan has been
substantially consummated, upon request of the debtor, the trustee, the United States trustee, or the
holder of an allowed unsecured claim, to—
(1) increase or reduce the amount of payments on claims of a particular class provided for by
the plan;
(2) extend or reduce the time period for such payments; or
(3) alter the amount of the distribution to a creditor whose claim is provided for by the plan to
the extent necessary to take account of any payment of such claim made other than under the plan.
(f)(1) Sections 1121 through 1128 and the requirements of section 1129 apply to any modification
under subsection (e).
(2) The plan, as modified, shall become the plan only after there has been disclosure under section
1125 as the court may direct, notice and a hearing, and such modification is approved.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1127(a) of the House amendment adopts a provision contained in the House bill permitting only the
proponent of a plan to modify the plan and rejecting the alternative of open modification contained in the
Senate amendment.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Under subsection (a) the proponent may file a proposal to modify a plan prior to confirmation. In the case
of a public company the modifying proposal may be filed prior to approval.
Subsection (b) provides that a party in interest eligible to file a plan may file instead of a plan a proposal to
modify a plan filed by another. Under subsection (c) a party in interest objecting to some feature of a plan may
submit a proposal to modify the plan to meet the objection.
After a plan has been confirmed, but before its substantial consummation, a plan may be modified by leave
of court, which subsection (d) provides shall be granted for good cause. Subsection (e) provides that a
proposal to modify a plan is subject to the disclosure requirements of section 1125 and as provided in
subsection (f). It provides that a creditor or stockholder who voted for or against a plan is deemed to have
accepted or rejected the modifying proposal. But if the modification materially and adversely affects any of
their interests, they must be afforded an opportunity to change their vote in accordance with the disclosure and
solicitation requirements of section 1125.
Under subsection (g) a plan, if modified prior to confirmation, shall be confirmed if it meets the
requirements of section 1130.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (a) permits the proponent of a plan to modify it at any time before confirmation, subject, of
[Release Point 118-106]
course, to the requirements of sections 1122 and 1123, governing classification and contents of a plan. After
the proponent of a plan files a modification with the court, the plan as modified becomes the plan, and is to be
treated the same as an original plan.
Subsection (b) permits modification of a plan after confirmation under certain circumstances. The
modification must be proposed before substantial consummation of the plan. The requirements of sections
1122 and 1123 continue to apply. The plan as modified under this subsection becomes the plan only if the
court confirms the plan as modified under section 1129 and the circumstances warrant the modification.
Subsection (c) requires the proponent of a modification to comply with the disclosure provisions of section
1125. Of course, if the modification were sufficiently minor, the court might determine that additional
disclosure was not required under the circumstances.
Subsection (d) simplifies modification procedure by deeming any creditor or equity security holder that has
already accepted or rejected the plan to have accepted or rejected the modification, unless, within the time
fixed by the court, the creditor or equity security holder changes this previous acceptance or rejection.

(A) each holder of a claim or interest of such class—
(i) has accepted the plan; or
(ii) will receive or retain under the plan on account of such claim or interest property of a

(8) With respect to each class of claims or interests—
(A) such class has accepted the plan; or
(B) such class is not impaired under the plan.

of such claim, the plan provides that—

benefits, as that term is defined in section 1114 of this title, at the level established pursuant to

plan, for the duration of the period the debtor has obligated itself to provide such benefits.
(14) If the debtor is required by a judicial or administrative order, or by statute, to pay a
domestic support obligation, the debtor has paid all amounts payable under such order or such
statute for such obligation that first become payable after the date of the filing of the petition.

unsecured claim objects to the confirmation of the plan—
(A) the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of the property to be distributed under the
plan on account of such claim is not less than the amount of such claim; or
(B) the value of the property to be distributed under the plan is not less than the projected
disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section 1325(b)(2)) to be received during the
5-year period beginning on the date that the first payment is due under the plan, or during the
period for which the plan provides payments, whichever is longer.
(16) All transfers of property under the plan shall be made in accordance with any applicable
provisions of nonbankruptcy law that govern the transfer of property by a corporation or trust that
is not a moneyed, business, or commercial corporation or trust.
(b)(1) Notwithstanding section 510(a) of this title, if all of the applicable requirements of
subsection (a) of this section other than paragraph (8) are met with respect to a plan, the court, on
request of the proponent of the plan, shall confirm the plan notwithstanding the requirements of such
paragraph if the plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each
class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan.
(2) For the purpose of this subsection, the condition that a plan be fair and equitable with respect
to a class includes the following requirements:
(A) With respect to a class of secured claims, the plan provides—
(i)(I) that the holders of such claims retain the liens securing such claims, whether the
property subject to such liens is retained by the debtor or transferred to another entity, to the
extent of the allowed amount of such claims; and
(II) that each holder of a claim of such class receive on account of such claim deferred cash
payments totaling at least the allowed amount of such claim, of a value, as of the effective date
of the plan, of at least the value of such holder's interest in the estate's interest in such property;
[Release Point 118-106]
(ii) for the sale, subject to section 363(k) of this title, of any property that is subject to the
liens securing such claims, free and clear of such liens, with such liens to attach to the proceeds
of such sale, and the treatment of such liens on proceeds under clause (i) or (iii) of this
subparagraph; or
(iii) for the realization by such holders of the indubitable equivalent of such claims.
(B) With respect to a class of unsecured claims—
(i) the plan provides that each holder of a claim of such class receive or retain on account of
such claim property of a value, as of the effective date of the plan, equal to the allowed amount
of such claim; or
(ii) the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such class will not receive
or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property, except that in a
case in which the debtor is an individual, the debtor may retain property included in the estate
under section 1115, subject to the requirements of subsection (a)(14) of this section.
(C) With respect to a class of interests—
(i) the plan provides that each holder of an interest of such class receive or retain on account
of such interest property of a value, as of the effective date of the plan, equal to the greatest of
the allowed amount of any fixed liquidation preference to which such holder is entitled, any
fixed redemption price to which such holder is entitled, or the value of such interest; or
(ii) the holder of any interest that is junior to the interests of such class will not receive or
retain under the plan on account of such junior interest any property.
(c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section and except as provided in section
1127(b) of this title, the court may confirm only one plan, unless the order of confirmation in the
case has been revoked under section 1144 of this title. If the requirements of subsections (a) and (b)
of this section are met with respect to more than one plan, the court shall consider the preferences of
creditors and equity security holders in determining which plan to confirm.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, on request of a party in interest that is a
governmental unit, the court may not confirm a plan if the principal purpose of the plan is the
avoidance of taxes or the avoidance of the application of section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. In
any hearing under this subsection, the governmental unit has the burden of proof on the issue of
avoidance.
(e) In a small business case, the court shall confirm a plan that complies with the applicable
provisions of this title and that is filed in accordance with section 1121(e) not later than 45 days after

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1129 of the House amendment relates to confirmation of a plan in a case under chapter 11. Section
1129(a)(3) of the House amendment adopts the position taken in the Senate amendment and section
1129(a)(5) takes the position adopted in the House bill. Section 1129(a)(7) adopts the position taken in the
House bill in order to insure that the dissenting members of an accepting class will receive at least what they
would otherwise receive under the best interest of creditors test; it also requires that even the members of a
class that has rejected the plan be protected by the best interest of creditors test for those rare cramdown cases
where a class of creditors would receive more on liquidation than under reorganization of the debtor. Section
1129(a)(7)(C) is discussed in connection with section 1129(b) and section 1111(b). Section 1129(a)(8) of the
House amendment adopts the provision taken in the House bill which permits confirmation of a plan as to a
[Release Point 118-106]
particular class without resort to the fair and equitable test if the class has accepted a plan or is unimpaired
under the plan.
Section 1129(a)(9) represents a compromise between a similar provision contained in the House bill and the
Senate amendment. Under subparagraph (A) claims entitled to priority under section 507(a)(1) or (2) are
entitled to receive cash on the effective date of the plan equal to the amount of the claim. Under subparagraph
(B) claims entitled to priority under section 507(a)(3), (4), or (5), are entitled to receive deferred cash
payments of a present value as of the effective date of the plan equal to the amount of the claims if the class
has accepted the plan or cash payments on the effective date of the plan otherwise. Tax claims entitled to
priority under section 507(a)(6) of different governmental units may not be contained in one class although all
claims of one such unit may be combined and such unit may be required to take deferred cash payments over a
period not to exceed 6 years after the date of assessment of the tax with the present value equal to the amount
of the claim.
Section 1129(a)(10) is derived from section 1130(a)(12) of the Senate amendment.
Section 1129(b) is new. Together with section 1111(b) and section 1129(a)(7)(C), this section provides
when a plan may be confirmed, notwithstanding the failure of an impaired class to accept the plan under
section 1129(a)(8). Before discussing section 1129(b) an understanding of section 1111(b) is necessary.
Section 1111(b)(1), the general rule that a secured claim is to be treated as a recourse claim in chapter 11
whether or not the claim is nonrecourse by agreement or applicable law. This preferred status for a
nonrecourse loan terminates if the property securing the loan is sold under section 363 or is to be sold under
the plan.
The preferred status also terminates if the class of which the secured claim is a part elects application of
section 1111(b)(2). Section 1111(b)(2) provides that an allowed claim is a secured claim to the full extent the
claim is allowed rather than to the extent of the collateral as under section 506(a). A class may elect
application of paragraph (2) only if the security is not of inconsequential value and, if the creditor is a recourse
creditor, the collateral is not sold under section 363 or to be sold under the plan. Sale of property under section
363 or under the plan is excluded from treatment under section 1111(b) because of the secured party's right to
bid in the full amount of his allowed claim at any sale of collateral under section 363(k) of the House
amendment.
As previously noted, section 1129(b) sets forth a standard by which a plan may be confirmed
notwithstanding the failure of an impaired class to accept the plan.
Paragraph (1) makes clear that this alternative confirmation standard, referred to as "cram down," will be
called into play only on the request of the proponent of the plan. Under this cramdown test, the court must
confirm the plan if the plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is "fair and equitable," with respect to each
class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan. The requirement of the
House bill that a plan not "discriminate unfairly" with respect to a class is included for clarity; the language in
the House report interpreting that requirement, in the context of subordinated debentures, applies equally
under the requirements of section 1129(b)(1) of the House amendment.
Although many of the factors interpreting "fair and equitable" are specified in paragraph (2), others, which
were explicated in the description of section 1129(b) in the House report, were omitted from the House
amendment to avoid statutory complexity and because they would undoubtedly be found by a court to be
fundamental to "fair and equitable" treatment of a dissenting class. For example, a dissenting class should be
assured that no senior class receives more than 100 percent of the amount of its claims. While that
requirement was explicitly included in the House bill, the deletion is intended to be one of style and not one of
substance.
Paragraph (2) provides guidelines for a court to determine whether a plan is fair and equitable with respect
to a dissenting class. It must be emphasized that the fair and equitable requirement applies only with respect to
dissenting classes. Therefore, unlike the fair and equitable rule contained in chapter X [chapter 10 of former
title 11] and section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act [section 205 of former title 11] under section 1129(b)(2), senior
accepting classes are permitted to give up value to junior classes as long as no dissenting intervening class
receives less than the amount of its claims in full. If there is no dissenting intervening class and the only
dissent is from a class junior to the class to which value have been given up, then the plan may still be fair and
equitable with respect to the dissenting class, as long as no class senior to the dissenting class has received
more than 100 percent of the amount of its claims.
Paragraph (2) contains three subparagraphs, each of which applies to a particular kind of class of claims or
interests that is impaired and has not accepted the plan. Subparagraph (A) applies when a class of secured
claims is impaired and has not accepted the plan. The provision applies whether or not section 1111(b)
applies. The plan may be crammed down notwithstanding the dissent of a secured class only if the plan
complies with clause (i), (ii), or (iii).
[Release Point 118-106]
Clause (i) permits cramdown if the dissenting class of secured claims will retain its lien on the property
whether the property is retained by the debtor or transferred. It should be noted that the lien secures the
allowed secured claim held by such holder. The meaning of "allowed secured claim" will vary depending on
whether section 1111(b)(2) applies to such class.
If section 1111(b)(2) applies then the "electing" class is entitled to have the entire allowed amount of the
debt related to such property secured by a lien even if the value of the collateral is less than the amount of the
debt. In addition, the plan must provide for the holder to receive, on account of the allowed secured claims,
payments, either present or deferred, of a principal face amount equal to the amount of the debt and of a
present value equal to the value of the collateral.
For example, if a creditor loaned $15,000,000 to a debtor secured by real property worth $18,000,000 and
the value of the real property had dropped to $12,000,000 by the date when the debtor commenced a
proceeding under chapter 11, the plan could be confirmed notwithstanding the dissent of the creditor as long
as the lien remains on the collateral to secure a $15,000,000 debt, the face amount of present or extended
payments to be made to the creditor under the plan is at least $15,000,000, and the present value of the present
or deferred payments is not less than $12,000,000. The House report accompanying the House bill described
what is meant by "present value".
Clause (ii) is self explanatory. Clause (iii) requires the court to confirm the plan notwithstanding the dissent
of the electing secured class if the plan provides for the realization by the secured class of the indubitable
equivalents of the secured claims. The standard of "indubitable equivalents" is taken from In re Murel Holding
Corp., 75 F.2d 941 (2d Cir. 1935) (Learned Hand, Jr.).
Abandonment of the collateral to the creditor would clearly satisfy indubitable equivalence, as would a lien
on similar collateral. However, present cash payments less than the secured claim would not satisfy the
standard because the creditor is deprived of an opportunity to gain from a future increase in value of the
collateral. Unsecured notes as to the secured claim or equity securities of the debtor would not be the
indubitable equivalent. With respect to an oversecured creditor, the secured claim will never exceed the
allowed claim.
Although the same language applies, a different result pertains with respect to a class of secured claims to
which section 1111(b)(2) does not apply. This will apply to all claims secured by a right of setoff. The court
must confirm the plan notwithstanding the dissent of such a class of secured claims if any of three alternative
requirements is met. Under clause (i) the plan may be confirmed if the class retains a right of setoff or a lien
securing the allowed secured claims of the class and the holders will receive payments of a present value equal
to the allowed amount of their secured claims. Contrary to electing classes of secured creditors who retain a
lien under subparagraph (A)(i)(I) to the extent of the entire claims secured by such lien, nonelecting creditors
retain a lien on collateral only to the extent of their allowed secured claims and not to the extent of any
deficiency, and such secured creditors must receive present or deferred payments with a present value equal to
the allowed secured claim, which in turn is only the equivalent of the value of the collateral under section
506(a).
Any deficiency claim of a nonelecting class of secured claims is treated as an unsecured claim and is not
provided for under subparagraph (A). The plan may be confirmed under clause (ii) if the plan proposes to sell
the property free and clear of the secured party's lien as long as the lien will attach to the proceeds and will
receive treatment under clause (i) or (iii). Clause (iii) permits confirmation if the plan provides for the
realization by the dissenting nonelecting class of secured claims of the indubitable equivalent of the secured
claims of such class.
Contrary to an "electing" class to which section 1111(b)(2) applies, the nonelecting class need not be
protected with respect to any future appreciation in value of the collateral since the secured claim of such a
class is never undersecured by reason of section 506(a). Thus the lien secures only the value of interest of such
creditor in the collateral. To the extent deferred payments exceed that amount, they represent interest. In the
event of a subsequent default, the portion of the face amount of deferred payments representing unaccrued
interest will not be secured by the lien.
Subparagraph (B) applies to a dissenting class of unsecured claims. The court must confirm the plan
notwithstanding the dissent of a class of impaired unsecured claims if the plan provides for such claims to
receive property with a present value equal to the allowed amount of the claims. Unsecured claims may
receive any kind of "property," which is used in its broadest sense, as long as the present value of the property
given to the holders of unsecured claims is equal to the allowed amount of the claims. Some kinds of property,
such as securities, may require difficult valuations by the court; in such circumstances the court need only
determine that there is a reasonable likelihood that the property given the dissenting class of impaired
unsecured claims equals the present value of such allowed claims.
Alternatively, under clause (ii), the court must confirm the plan if the plan provides that holders of any
[Release Point 118-106]
claims or interests junior to the interests of the dissenting class of impaired unsecured claims will not receive
any property under the plan on account of such junior claims or interests. As long as senior creditors have not
been paid more than in full, and classes of equal claims are being treated so that the dissenting class of
impaired unsecured claims is not being discriminated against unfairly, the plan may be confirmed if the
impaired class of unsecured claims receives less than 100 cents on the dollar (or nothing at all) as long as no
class junior to the dissenting class receives anything at all. Such an impaired dissenting class may not prevent
confirmation of a plan by objection merely because a senior class has elected to give up value to a junior class
that is higher in priority than the impaired dissenting class of unsecured claims as long as the above safeguards
are met.
Subparagraph (C) applies to a dissenting class of impaired interests. Such interests may include the interests
of general or limited partners in a partnership, the interests of a sole proprietor in a proprietorship, or the
interest of common or preferred stockholders in a corporation. If the holders of such interests are entitled to a
fixed liquidation preference or fixed redemption price on account of such interests then the plan may be
confirmed notwithstanding the dissent of such class of interests as long as it provides the holders property of a
present value equal to the greatest of the fixed redemption price, or the value of such interests. In the event
there is no fixed liquidation preference or redemption price, then the plan may be confirmed as long as it
provides the holders of such interests property of a present value equal to the value of such interests. If the
interests are "under water" then they will be valueless and the plan may be confirmed notwithstanding the
dissent of that class of interests even if the plan provides that the holders of such interests will not receive any
property on account of such interests.
Alternatively, under clause (ii), the court must confirm the plan notwithstanding the dissent of a class of
interests if the plan provides that holders of any interests junior to the dissenting class of interests will not
receive or retain any property on account of such junior interests. Clearly, if there are no junior interests junior
to the class of dissenting interests, then the condition of clause (ii) is satisfied. The safeguards that no claim or
interest receive more than 100 percent of the allowed amount of such claim or interest and that no class be
discriminated against unfairly will insure that the plan is fair and equitable with respect to the dissenting class
of interests.
Except to the extent of the treatment of secured claims under subparagraph (A) of this statement, the House
report remains an accurate description of confirmation of section 1129(b). Contrary to the example contained
in the Senate report, a senior class will not be able to give up value to a junior class over the dissent of an
intervening class unless the intervening class receives the full amount, as opposed to value, of its claims or
interests.
One last point deserves explanation with respect to the admittedly complex subject of confirmation. Section
1129(a)(7)(C) in effect exempts secured creditors making an election under section 1111(b)(2) from
application of the best interest of creditors test. In the absence of an election the amount such creditors receive
in a plan of liquidation would be the value of their collateral plus any amount recovered on the deficiency in
the case of a recourse loan. However, under section 1111(b)(2), the creditors are given an allowed secured
claim to the full extent the claim is allowed and have no unsecured deficiency. Since section 1129(b)(2)(A)
makes clear that an electing class need receive payments of a present value only equal to the value of the
collateral, it is conceivable that under such a "cram down" the electing creditors would receive nothing with
respect to their deficiency. The advantage to the electing creditors is that they have a lien securing the full
amount of the allowed claim so that if the value of the collateral increases after the case is closed, the deferred
payments will be secured claims. Thus it is both reasonable and necessary to exempt such electing class from
application of section 1129(a)(7) as a logical consequence of permitting election under section 1111(b)(2).
Section 1131 of the Senate amendment is deleted as unnecessary in light of the protection given a secured
creditor under section 1129(b) of the House amendment.
Payment of taxes in reorganizations: Under the provisions of section 1141 as revised by the House
amendment, an individual in reorganization under chapter 11 will not be discharged from any debt, including
prepetition tax liabilities, which are nondischargeable under section 523. Thus, an individual debtor whose
plan of reorganization is confirmed under chapter 11 will remain liable for prepetition priority taxes, as
defined in section 507, and for tax liabilities which receive no priority but are nondischargeable under section
523, including no return, late return, and fraud liabilities.
In the case of a partnership or a corporation in reorganization under chapter 11 of title 11, section
1141(d)(1) of the House amendment adopts a provision limiting the taxes that must be provided for in a plan
before a plan can be confirmed to taxes which receive priority under section 507. In addition, the House
amendment makes dischargeable, in effect, tax liabilities attributable to no return, late return, or fraud
situations. The amendment thus does not adopt a shareholder continuity test such as was contained in section
1141(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the Senate amendment. However, the House amendment amends section 1106, relating
[Release Point 118-106]
to duties of the trustee, to require the trustee to furnish, on request of a tax authority and without personal
liability, information available to the trustee concerning potential prepetition tax liabilities for unfiled returns
of the debtor. Depending on the condition of the debtor's books and records, this information may include
schedules and files available to the business. The House amendment also does not prohibit a tax authority
from disallowing any tax benefit claimed after the reorganization if the item originated in a deduction, credit,
or other item improperly reported before the reorganization occurred. It may also be appropriate for the
Congress to consider in the future imposing civil or criminal liability on corporate officers for preparing a
false or fraudulent tax return. The House amendment also contemplates that the Internal Revenue Service will
monitor the relief from liabilities under this provision and advise the Congress if, and to the extent, any
significant tax abuse may be resulting from the provision.
Medium of payment of taxes: Federal, State, and local taxes incurred during the administration period of the
estate, and during the "gap" period in an involuntary case, are to be paid solely in cash. Taxes relating to third
priority wages are to be paid, under the general rules, in cash on the effective date of the plan, if the class has
not accepted the plan, in an amount equal to the allowed amount of the claim. If the class has accepted the
plan, the taxes must be paid in cash but the payments must be made at the time the wages are paid which may
be paid in deferred periodic installments having a value, on the effective date of the plan, equal to the allowed
amount of the tax claims. Prepetition taxes entitled to sixth priority under section 507(a)(6) also must be paid
in cash, but the plan may also permit the debtor whether a corporation, partnership, or an individual, to pay the
allowed taxes in installments over a period not to exceed 6 years following the date on which the tax authority
assesses the tax liability, provided the value of the deferred payments representing principal and interest, as of
the effective date of the plan, equals the allowed amount of the tax claim.
The House amendment also modifies the provisions of both bills dealing with the time when tax liabilities
of a debtor in reorganization may be assessed by the tax authority. The House amendment follows the Senate
amendment in deleting the limitation in present law under which a priority tax assessed after a reorganization
plan is confirmed must be assessed within 1 year after the date of the filing of the petition. The House
amendment specifies broadly that after the bankruptcy court determines the liability of the estate for a
prepetition tax or for an administration period tax, the governmental unit may thereafter assess the tax against
the estate, debtor, or successor to the debtor. The party to be assessed will, of course, depend on whether the
case is under chapter 7, 11, or 13, whether the debtor is an individual, partnership, or a corporation, and
whether the court is determining an individual debtor's personal liability for a nondischargeable tax.
Assessment of the tax may only be made, however, within the limits of otherwise applicable law, such as the
statute of limitations under the tax law.
Tax avoidance purpose: The House bill provided that no reorganization plan may be approved if the
principal purpose of the plan is the avoidance of taxes. The Senate amendment modified the rule so that the
bankruptcy court need make a determination of tax avoidance purpose only if it is asked to do so by the
appropriate tax authority. Under the Senate amendment, if the tax authority does not request the bankruptcy
court to rule on the purpose of the plan, the tax authority would not be barred from later asserting a tax
avoidance motive with respect to allowance of a deduction or other tax benefit claimed after the
reorganization. The House amendment adopts the substance of the Senate amendment, but does not provide a
basis by which a tax authority may collaterally attack confirmation of a plan of reorganization other than
under section 1144.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
[Section 1130 (enacted as section 1129)] Subsection (a) enumerates the requirement governing
confirmation of a plan. The court is required to confirm a plan if and only if all of the requirements are met.
Paragraph (1) requires that the plan comply with the applicable provisions of chapter 11, such as sections
1122 and 1123, governing classification and contents of plan.
Paragraph (2) requires that the proponent of the plan comply with the applicable provisions of chapter 11,
such as section 1125 regarding disclosure.
Paragraph (3) requires that the plan have been proposed in good faith, and not by any means forbidden by
law.
Paragraph (4) is derived from section 221 of chapter X [section 621 of former title 11]. It requires that any
payment made or promised by the proponent, the debtor, or person issuing securities or acquiring property
under the plan, for services or for costs and expenses in, or in connection with the case, or in connection with
the plan and incident to the case, be disclosed to the court. In addition, any payment made before confirmation
must have been reasonable, and any payment to be fixed after confirmation must be subject to the approval of
the court as reasonable.
Paragraph (5) is also derived from section 221 of chapter X [section 621 of former title 11]. It requires the
[Release Point 118-106]
plan to disclose the identity and affiliations of any individual proposed to serve, after confirmation, as a
director, officer, or voting trustee of the reorganized debtor. The appointment to or continuance in one of these
offices by the individual must be consistent with the interests of creditors and equity security holders and with
public policy. The plan must also disclose the identity of any insider that will be employed or retained by the
reorganized debtor, and the nature of any compensation to be paid to the insider.
Paragraph (6) permits confirmation only if any regulatory commission that will have jurisdiction over the
debtor after confirmation of the plan has approved any rate change provided for in the plan. As an alternative,
the rate change may be conditioned on such approval.
Paragraph (7) provides that in the case of a public company the court shall confirm the plan if it finds the
plan to be fair and equitable and the plan either (1) has been accepted by classes of claims or interests as
provided in section 1126, or (2), if not so accepted, satisfies the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.
Paragraphs (8) and (9) apply only in nonpublic cases. Paragraph (8) does not apply the fair and equitable
standards in two situations. The first occurs if there is unanimous consent of all affected holders of claims and
interests. It is also sufficient for purposes of confirmation if each holder of a claim or interest receives or
retains consideration of a value, as of the effective date of the plan, that is not less than each would have or
receive if the debtor were liquidated under chapter 7 of this title. This standard adapts the test of "best interest
of creditors" as interpreted by the courts under chapter XI [chapter 11 of former title 11]. It is given broader
application in chapter 11 of this title since a plan under chapter 11 may affect not only unsecured claims but
secured claims and stock as well.
Under paragraph (9)(A), if a class of claims or interests has not accepted the plan, the court will confirm the
plan if, for the dissenting class and any class of equal rank, the negotiated plan provides in value no less than
under a plan that is fair and equitable. Such review and determination are not required for any other classes
that accepted the plan.
Paragraph (9)(A) would permit a senior creditor to adjust his participation for the benefit of stockholders. In
such a case, junior creditors, who have not been satisfied in full, may not object if, absent the "give-up", they
are receiving all that a fair and equitable plan would give them. To illustrate, suppose the estate is valued at
$1.5 million and claims and stock are:
Claims and stock (millions) Equity (millions)
(1) Senior debt $1.2 $1.2
(2) Junior debt .5 .3
(3) Stock (1) –
Total 1.7 1.5
1 No value.
Under the plan, the senior creditor gives up $100,000 in value for the benefit of stockholders as follows:
Millions
(1) Senior debt $1.1
(2) Junior debt .3
(3) Stock .1
Total 1.5
If the junior creditors dissent, the court may nevertheless confirm the plan since under the fair and equitable
standard they had an equity of only $300,000 and the allocation to equity security holders did not affect them.
Paragraph (9)(A) provides a special alternative with respect to secured claims. A plan may be confirmed
against a dissenting class of secured claims if the plan or order of confirmation provides for the realization of
their security (1) by the retention of the property subject to such security; (2) by a sale of the property and
transfer of the claim to the proceeds of sale if the secured creditors were permitted to bid at the sale and set off
against the purchase price up to the allowed amount of their claims; or (3) by such other method that will
assure them the realization of the indubitable equivalent of the allowed amount of their secured claims. The
[Release Point 118-106]
indubitable equivalent language is intended to follow the strict approach taken by Judge Learned Hand in In
Re Murel Holding Corp. 75, F.2d 941 (2nd Cir. 1935).
Paragraph (9)(B) provides that, if a class of claims or interests is excluded from participation under the
plan, the court may nevertheless confirm the plan if it determines that no class on a parity with or junior to
such participates under the plan. In the previous illustration, no confirmation would be permitted if the
negotiated plan would grant a participation to stockholders but nothing for junior creditors. As noted
elsewhere, by reason of section 1126(g), an excluded class is a dissenting class under section 1130.
Paragraph (10) states that, to be confirmed, the plan must provide that each holder of a claim under section
507 will receive property, as therein noted, of a value equal to the allowed amount of the claim. There are two
exceptions: (A) The holder thereof may agree to a different settlement in part or in whole; (B) where a debtor's
business is reorganized under chapter 11, this provision requires that taxes entitled to priority (including
administrative claims or taxes) must be paid in cash not later than 120 days after the plan is confirmed, unless
the Secretary of the Treasury agrees to other terms or kinds of payment. The bill, as introduced, required full
payment in cash within 60 days after the plan is confirmed.
Paragraph (11) requires a determination regarding feasibility of the plan. It is a slight elaboration of the law
that has developed in the application of the word "feasible" in Chapter X of the present Act [chapter 10 of
former title 11].
Paragraph (12) requires that at least one class must accept the plan, but any claims or interests held by
insiders are not to be included for purposes of determining the number and amount of acceptances.
Subsection (b) provides that if, in the case of a public company, the plan meets the requirements of
subsection (a) (except paragraphs (8) and (9) which do not apply to such a company), the court is to confirm
the plan if the plan or the order of confirmation provides adequate protection for the realization of the value of
the claims or interests of each class not accepting the plan. The intent is to incorporate inclusively, as a guide
to the meaning of subsection (a) the provisions of section 216(7) ([former] 11 U.S.C. 616(7)) with respect to
claims and section 216(8) ([former] 11 U.S.C. 616(8)) with respect to equity security interests.
Under subsection (c) the court may confirm only one plan, unless the order of confirmation has been
revoked under section 1144. If the requirements for confirmation are met with respect to more than one plan,
the court shall consider the preferences of creditors and stockholders in deciding which plan to confirm.
Subsection (d) provides that the bankruptcy court may not confirm a plan of reorganization if its principal
purpose is the avoidance of taxes or the avoidance of section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77e).
This rules modifies a similar provision of present law (section 269 of the Bankruptcy Act [section 669 of
former title 11]).
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Paragraph (7) [of subsec. (a)] incorporates the former "best interest of creditors" test found in chapter 11,
but spells out precisely what is intended. With respect to each class, the holders of the claims or interests of
that class must receive or retain under the plan on account of those claims or interest property of a value, as of
the effective date of the plan, that is not less than the amount that they would so receive or retain if the debtor
were liquidated under chapter 7 on the effective date of the plan.
In order to determine the hypothetical distribution in a liquidation, the court will have to consider the
various subordination provisions of proposed 11 U.S.C. 510, 726(a)(3), 726(a)(4), and the postponement
provisions of proposed 11 U.S.C. 724. Also applicable in appropriate cases will be the rules governing
partnership distributions under proposed 11 U.S.C. 723, and distributions of community property under
proposed 11 U.S.C. 726(c). Under subparagraph (A), a particular holder is permitted to accept less than
liquidation value, but his acceptance does not bind the class.
Property under subparagraph (B) may include securities of the debtor. Thus, the provision will apply in
cases in which the plan is confirmed under proposed 11 U.S.C. 1129(b).
Paragraph (8) is central to the confirmation standards. It requires that each class either have accepted the
plan or be unimpaired.
Paragraph (9) augments the requirements of paragraph (8) by requiring payment of each priority claim in
full. It permits payments over time and payment other than in cash, but payment in securities is not intended to
be permitted without consent of the priority claimant even if the class has consented. It also permits a
particular claimant to accept less than full payment.
Subsection (b) permits the court to confirm a plan notwithstanding failure of compliance with paragraph (8)
of subsection (a). The plan must comply with all other paragraphs of subsection (a), including paragraph (9).
This subsection contains the so-called cramdown. It requires simply that the plan meet certain standards of
fairness to dissenting creditors or equity security holders. The general principle of the subsection permits
confirmation notwithstanding nonacceptance by an impaired class if that class and all below it in priority are
[Release Point 118-106]
treated according to the absolute priority rule. The dissenting class must be paid in full before any junior class
may share under the plan. If it is paid in full, then junior classes may share. Treatment of classes of secured
creditors is slightly different because they do not fall in the priority ladder, but the principle is the same.
Specifically, the court may confirm a plan over the objection of a class of secured claims if the members of
that class are unimpaired or if they are to receive under the plan property of a value equal to the allowed
amount of their secured claims, as determined under proposed 11 U.S.C. 506(a). The property is to be valued
as of the effective date of the plan, thus recognizing the time-value of money. As used throughout this
subsection, "property" includes both tangible and intangible property, such as a security of the debtor or a
successor to the debtor under a reorganization plan.
The court may confirm over the dissent of a class of unsecured claims, including priority claims, only if the
members of the class are unimpaired, if they will receive under the plan property of a value equal to the
allowed amount of their unsecured claims, or if no class junior will share under the plan. That is, if the class is
impaired, then they must be paid in full or, if paid less than in full, then no class junior may receive anything
under the plan. This codifies the absolute priority rule from the dissenting class on down.
With respect to classes of equity, the court may confirm over a dissent if the members of the class are
unimpaired, if they receive their liquidation preference or redemption rights, if any, or if no class junior shares
under the plan. This, too, is a codification of the absolute priority rule with respect to equity. If a partnership
agreement subordinates limited partners to general partners to any degree, then the general principles of
paragraph (3) of this subsection would apply to prevent the general partners from being squeezed out.
One requirement applies generally to all classes before the court may confirm under this subsection. No
class may be paid more than in full.
The partial codification of the absolute priority rule here is not intended to deprive senior creditor of
compensation for being required to take securities in the reorganized debtor that are of an equal priority with
the securities offered to a junior class. Under current law, seniors are entitled to compensation for their loss of
priority, and the increased risk put upon them by being required to give up their priority will be reflected in a
lower value of the securities given to them than the value of comparable securities given to juniors that have
not lost a priority position.
Finally, the proponent must request use of this subsection. The court may not confirm notwithstanding
nonacceptance unless the proponent requests and the court may then confirm only if subsection (b) is
complied with. The court may not rewrite the plan.
A more detailed explanation follows:
The test to be applied by the court is set forth in the various paragraphs of section 1129(b). The elements of
the test are new[,] departing from both the absolute priority rule and the best interests of creditors tests found
under the Bankruptcy Act [former title 11]. The court is not permitted to alter the terms of the plan. It must
merely decide whether the plan complies with the requirements of section 1129(b). If so, the plan is
confirmed, if not the plan is denied confirmation.
The procedure followed is simple. The court examines each class of claims or interests designated under
section 1123(a)(1) to see if the requirements of section 1129(b) are met. If the class is a class of secured
claims, then paragraph (1) contains two tests that must be complied with in order for confirmation to occur.
First, under subparagraph (A), the court must be able to find that the consideration given under the plan on
account of the secured claim does not exceed the allowed amount of the claim. This condition is not
prescribed as a matter of law under section 1129(a), because if the secured claim is compensated in securities
of the debtor, a valuation of the business would be necessary to determine the value of the consideration.
While section 1129(a) does not contemplate a valuation of the debtor's business, such a valuation will almost
always be required under section 1129(b) in order to determine the value of the consideration to be distributed
under the plan. Once the valuation is performed, it becomes a simple matter to impose the criterion that no
claim will be paid more than in full.
Application of the test under subparagraph (A) also requires a valuation of the consideration "as of the
effective date of the plan". This contemplates a present value analysis that will discount value to be received
in the future; of course, if the interest rate paid is equivalent to the discount rate used, the present value and
face future value will be identical. On the other hand, if no interest is proposed to be paid, the present value
will be less than the face future value. For example, consider an allowed secured claim of $1,000 in a class by
itself. One plan could propose to pay $1,000 on account of this claim as of the effective date of the plan.
Another plan could propose to give a note with a $1,000 face amount due five years after the effective date of
the plan on account of this claim. A third plan could propose to give a note in a face amount of $1,000 due
five years from the effective date of the plan plus six percent annual interest commencing on the effective date
[Release Point 118-106]
of the plan on account of this claim. The first plan clearly meets the requirements of subparagraph (A) because
the amount received on account of the second claim has an equivalent present value as of the effective date of
the plan equal to the allowed amount of such claim.
The second plan also meets the requirements of subparagraph (A) because the present value of the five
years note as of the effective date of the plan will never exceed the allowed amount of the secured claim; the
higher the discount rate, the less present value the note will have. Whether the third plan complies with
subparagraph (A) depends on whether the discount rate is less than six percent. Normally, the interest rate
used in the plan will be prima facie evidence of the discount rate because the interest rate will reflect an arms
length determination of the risk of the security involved and feasibility considerations will tend to understate
interest payments. If the court found the discount rate to be greater than or equal to the interest rate used in the
plan, then subparagraph (A) would be complied with because the value of the note as of the effective date of
the plan would not exceed the allowed amount of the second claim. If, however, the court found the discount
rate to be less than the interest rate proposed under the plan, then the present value of the note would exceed
$1,000 and the plan would fail of confirmation. On the other hand, it is important to recognize that the future
principal amount of a note in excess of the allowed amount of a secured claim may have a present value less
than such allowed amount, if the interest rate under the plan is correspondingly less than the discount rate.
Even if the requirements of subparagraph (A) are complied with, the class of secured claims must satisfy
one of the three clauses in paragraph (B) in order to pass muster. It is sufficient for confirmation if the class
has accepted the plan, or if the claims of the class are unimpaired, or if each holder of a secured claim in the
class will receive property of a value as of the effective date of the plan equal to the allowed amount of such
claim (unless he has agreed to accept less). It is important to note that under section 506(a), the allowed
amount of the secured claim will not include any extent to which the amount of such claim exceeds the value
of the property securing such claim. Thus, instead of focusing on secured creditors or unsecured creditors, the
statute focuses on secured claims and unsecured claims.
After the court has applied paragraph (1) to each class of secured claims, it then applies paragraph (2) to
each class of unsecured claims. Again two separate components must be tested. Subparagraph (A) is identical
with the test under section 1129(b)(1)(A) insofar as the holder of an unsecured claim is not permitted to
receive property of a value as of the effective date of the plan on account of such claim that is greater than the
allowed amount of such claim. In addition, subparagraph (B) requires compliance with one of four conditions.
The conditions in clauses (i)–(iii) mirror the conditions of acceptance unimpairment, or full value found in
connection with secured claims in section 1129(b)(1)(B).
The condition contained in section 1129(b)(2)(B)(iv) provides another basis for confirming the plan with
respect to a class of unsecured claims. It will be of greatest use when an impaired class that has not accepted
the plan is to receive less than full value under the plan. The plan may be confirmed under clause (iv) in those
circumstances if the class is not unfairly discriminated against with respect to equal classes and if junior
classes will receive nothing under the plan. The second criterion is the easier to understand. It is designed to
prevent a senior class from giving up consideration to a junior class unless every intermediate class consents,
is paid in full, or is unimpaired. This gives intermediate creditors a great deal of leverage in negotiating with
senior or secured creditors who wish to have a plan that gives value to equity. One aspect of this test that is
not obvious is that whether one class is senior, equal, or junior to another class is relative and not absolute.
Thus from the perspective of trade creditors holding unsecured claims, claims of senior and subordinated
debentures may be entitled to share on an equal basis with the trade claims. However, from the perspective of
the senior unsecured debt, the subordinated debentures are junior.
This point illustrates the lack of precision in the first criterion which demands that a class not be unfairly
discriminated against with respect to equal classes. From the perspective of unsecured trade claims, there is no
unfair discrimination as long as the total consideration given all other classes of equal rank does not exceed
the amount that would result from an exact aliquot distribution. Thus if trade creditors, senior debt, and
subordinate debt are each owed $100 and the plan proposes to pay the trade debt $15, the senior debt $30, and
the junior debt $0, the plan would not unfairly discriminate against the trade debt nor would any other
allocation of consideration under the plan between the senior and junior debt be unfair as to the trade debt as
long as the aggregate consideration is less than $30. The senior debt could take $25 and give up $5 to the
junior debt and the trade debt would have no cause to complain because as far as it is concerned the junior
debt is an equal class.
However, in this latter case the senior debt would have been unfairly discriminated against because the
trade debt was being unfairly over-compensated; of course the plan would also fail unless the senior debt was
unimpaired, received full value, or accepted the plan, because from its perspective a junior class received
property under the plan. Application of the test from the perspective of senior debt is best illustrated by the
plan that proposes to pay trade debt $15, senior debt $25, and junior debt $0. Here the senior debt is being
[Release Point 118-106]
unfairly discriminated against with respect to the equal trade debt even though the trade debt receives less than
the senior debt. The discrimination arises from the fact that the senior debt is entitled to the rights of the junior
debt which in this example entitle the senior debt to share on a 2:1 basis with the trade debt.
Finally, it is necessary to interpret the first criterion from the perspective of subordinated debt. The junior
debt is subrogated to the rights of senior debt once the senior debt is paid in full. Thus, while the plan that
pays trade debt $15, senior debt $25, and junior debt $0 is not unfairly discriminatory against the junior debt, a
plan that proposes to pay trade debt $55, senior debt $100, and junior debt $1, would be unfairly
discriminatory. In order to avoid discriminatory treatment against the junior debt, at least $10 would have to
be received by such debt under those facts.
The criterion of unfair discrimination is not derived from the fair and equitable rule or from the best
interests of creditors test. Rather it preserves just treatment of a dissenting class from the class's own
perspective.
If each class of secured claims satisfies the requirements of section 1129(b)(1) and each class of unsecured
claims satisfies the requirements of section 1129(b)(2), then the court must still see if each class of interests
satisfies section 1129(b)(3) before the plan may be confirmed. Again, two separate criteria must be met.
Under subparagraph (A) if the interest entitles the holder thereof to a fixed liquidation preference or if such
interest may be redeemed at a fixed price, then the holder of such interest must not receive under the plan on
account of such interest property of a value as of the effective date of the plan greater than the greater of these
two values of the interest. Preferred stock would be an example of an interest likely to have liquidation
preference or redemption price.
If an interest such as most common stock or the interest of a general partnership has neither a fixed
liquidation preference nor a fixed redemption price, then the criterion in subparagraph (A) is automatically
fulfilled. In addition subparagraph (B) contains five clauses that impose alternative conditions of which at
least one must be satisfied in order to warrant confirmation. The first two clauses contain requirements of
acceptance or unimpairment similar to the first two clauses in paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B). Clause (iii) is
similar to the unimpairment test contained in section 1124(3)(B), except that it will apply to cover the issuance
securities of the debtor of a value as of the effective date of the plan equal to the greater of any fixed
liquidation preference or redemption price. The fourth clause allows confirmation if junior interests are not
compensated under the plan and the fifth clause allows confirmation if there are no junior interests. These
clauses recognized that as long as senior classes receive no more than full payment, the objection of a junior
class will not defeat confirmation unless a class junior to it is receiving value under the plan and the objecting
class is impaired. While a determination of impairment may be made under section 1124(3)(B)(iii) without a
precise valuation of the business when common stock is clearly under water, once section 1129(b) is used, a
more detailed valuation is a necessary byproduct. Thus, if no property is given to a holder of an interest under
the plan, the interest should be clearly worthless in order to find unimpairment under section 1124(3)(B)(iii)
and section 1129(a)(8); otherwise, since a class of interests receiving no property is deemed to object under
section 1126(g), the more precise valuation of section 1129(b) should be used.
If all of the requirements of section 1129(b) are complied with, then the court may confirm the plan subject
to other limitations such as those found in section 1129(a) and (d).
Subsection (c) of section 1129 governs confirmation when more than one plan meets the requirements of
the section. The court must consider the preferences of creditors and equity security holders in determining
which plan to confirm.
Subsection (d) requires the court to deny confirmation if the principal purpose of the plan is the avoidance
of taxes (through use of sections 346 and 1146, and applicable provisions of State law or the Internal Revenue
Code [title 26] governing bankruptcy reorganizations) or the avoidance of section 5 of the Securities Act of
1933 [15 U.S.C. 77e] (through use of section 1145).

SUBCHAPTER III—POSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS
§1141. Effect of confirmation
(a) Except as provided in subsections (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, the provisions of a
confirmed plan bind the debtor, any entity issuing securities under the plan, any entity acquiring
property under the plan, and any creditor, equity security holder, or general partner in the debtor,
whether or not the claim or interest of such creditor, equity security holder, or general partner is
impaired under the plan and whether or not such creditor, equity security holder, or general partner
has accepted the plan.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in the plan or the order confirming the plan, the confirmation of
a plan vests all of the property of the estate in the debtor.
(c) Except as provided in subsections (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section and except as otherwise
provided in the plan or in the order confirming the plan, after confirmation of a plan, the property
dealt with by the plan is free and clear of all claims and interests of creditors, equity security holders,
and of general partners in the debtor.
(d)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, in the plan, or in the order confirming the
plan, the confirmation of a plan—
(A) discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the date of such confirmation, and any
debt of a kind specified in section 502(g), 502(h), or 502(i) of this title, whether or not—
(i) a proof of the claim based on such debt is filed or deemed filed under section 501 of this
title;
(ii) such claim is allowed under section 502 of this title; or
(iii) the holder of such claim has accepted the plan; and
(B) terminates all rights and interests of equity security holders and general partners provided
for by the plan.
(2) A discharge under this chapter does not discharge a debtor who is an individual from any debt
excepted from discharge under section 523 of this title.
(3) The confirmation of a plan does not discharge a debtor if—
(A) the plan provides for the liquidation of all or substantially all of the property of the estate;
(B) the debtor does not engage in business after consummation of the plan; and
[Release Point 118-106]
(C) the debtor would be denied a discharge under section 727(a) of this title if the case were a
case under chapter 7 of this title.
(4) The court may approve a written waiver of discharge executed by the debtor after the order for
relief under this chapter.
(5) In a case in which the debtor is an individual—
(A) unless after notice and a hearing the court orders otherwise for cause, confirmation of the
plan does not discharge any debt provided for in the plan until the court grants a discharge on
completion of all payments under the plan;
(B) at any time after the confirmation of the plan, and after notice and a hearing, the court may
grant a discharge to the debtor who has not completed payments under the plan if—
(i) the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property actually distributed under the
plan on account of each allowed unsecured claim is not less than the amount that would have
been paid on such claim if the estate of the debtor had been liquidated under chapter 7 on such
date;
(ii) modification of the plan under section 1127 is not practicable; and
(iii) subparagraph (C) permits the court to grant a discharge; and
(C) the court may grant a discharge if, after notice and a hearing held not more than 10 days
before the date of the entry of the order granting the discharge, the court finds that there is no
reasonable cause to believe that—
(i) section 522(q)(1) may be applicable to the debtor; and
(ii) there is pending any proceeding in which the debtor may be found guilty of a felony of
the kind described in section 522(q)(1)(A) or liable for a debt of the kind described in section
522(q)(1)(B);
and if the requirements of subparagraph (A) or (B) are met.
(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the confirmation of a plan does not discharge a debtor that is
a corporation from any debt—
(A) of a kind specified in paragraph (2)(A) or (2)(B) of section 523(a) that is owed to a

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1141(d) of the House amendment is derived from a comparable provision contained in the Senate
amendment. However, section 1141(d)(2) of the House amendment is derived from the House bill as
preferable to the Senate amendment. It is necessary for a corporation or partnership undergoing reorganization
to be able to present its creditors with a fixed list of liabilities upon which the creditors or third parties can
make intelligent decisions. Retaining an exception for discharge with respect to nondischargeable taxes would
leave an undesirable uncertainty surrounding reorganizations that is unacceptable. Section 1141(d)(3) is
derived from the Senate amendment. Section 1141(d)(4) is likewise derived from the Senate amendment.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) of this section makes the provisions of a confirmed plan binding on the debtor, any entity
issuing securities under the plan, any entity acquiring property under the plan, and any creditor, equity
[Release Point 118-106]
security holder, or general partner in the debtor, whether or not the claim or interest of the creditor, equity
security holder, or partner is impaired under the plan and whether or not he has accepted the plan. There are
two exceptions, enumerated in paragraph (2) and (3) of subsection (d).
Unless the plan or the order confirming the plan provides otherwise, the confirmation of a plan vests all of
the property of the estate in the debtor and releases it from all claims and interests of creditors, equity security
holders and general partners.
Subsection (d) contains the discharge for a reorganized debtor. Paragraph (1) specifies that the confirmation
of a plan discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the date of the order for relief unless the plan
or the order confirming the plan provides otherwise. The discharge is effective against those claims whether or
not proof of the claim is filed (or deemed filed), and whether or not the claim is allowed. The discharge also
terminates all rights and interests of equity security holders and general partners provided for by the plan. The
paragraph permits the plan or the order confirming the plan to provide otherwise, and excepts certain debts
from the discharge as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3).
Paragraph (2) of subsection (d) makes clear what taxes remain nondischargeable in the case of a corporate
debtor emerging from a reorganization under chapter 11. Nondischargeable taxes in such a reorganization are
the priority taxes (under section 507) and tax payments which come due during and after the proceeding under
a deferred or part-payment agreement which the debtor had entered into with the tax authority before the
bankruptcy proceedings began. On the other hand, a corporation which is taken over by its creditors through a
plan of reorganization will not continue to be liable for nonpriority taxes arising from the corporation's
prepetition fraud, failure to file a return, or failure to file a timely return, since the creditors who take over the
reorganized company should not bear the burden of acts for which the creditors were not at fault.
Paragraph (3) specifies that the debtor is not discharged by the confirmation of a plan if the plan is a
liquidating plan and if the debtor would be denied discharge in a liquidation case under section 727.
Specifically, if all or substantially all of the distribution under the plan is of all or substantially all of the
property of the estate or the proceeds of it, if the business, if any, of the debtor does not continue, and if the
debtor would be denied a discharge under section 727 (such as if the debtor were not an individual or if he had
committed an act that would lead to a denial of discharge), the chapter 11 discharge is not granted.
Paragraph (4) authorizes the court to approve a waiver of discharge by the debtor.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Paragraph (2) [of subsec. (d)] makes applicable to an individual debtor the general exceptions to discharge
that are enumerated in section 523(a) of the bankruptcy code.

(a) Except with respect to an entity that is an underwriter as defined in subsection (b) of this
section, section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and any State or local law requiring registration for
offer or sale of a security or registration or licensing of an issuer of, underwriter of, or broker or
dealer in, a security do not apply to—
(1) the offer or sale under a plan of a security of the debtor, of an affiliate participating in a joint

transaction by such stockbroker, a disclosure statement approved under section 1125 of this title,
and, if the court orders, information supplementing such disclosure statement.
(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection and except with respect to ordinary

§2(a)(37), Dec. 22, 2010, 124 Stat. 3561.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1145 of the House amendment deletes a provision contained in section 1145(a)(1) of the House bill
in favor of a more adequate provision contained in section 364(f) of the House amendment. In addition,
section 1145(d) has been added to indicate that the Trust Indenture Act [15 U.S.C. 77aaa et seq.] does not
apply to a commercial note issued under a plan, if the note matures not later than 1 year after the effective date
of the plan. Some commercial notes receive such an exemption under 304(a)(4) of the Trust Indenture Act of
1939 (15 U.S.C. §77ddd(a)(4)) and others may receive protection by incorporation by reference into the Trust
[Release Point 118-106]
Indenture Act of securities exempt under section 3a(3), (7), (9), or (10) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15
U.S.C. 77c(a)(3), (7), (9), (10)].
In light of the amendments made to the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.] in title III of the
House amendment to H.R. 8200, a specific exemption from the Trust Indenture Act [15 U.S.C. 77aaa et seq.]
is required in order to create certainty regarding plans of reorganization. Section 1145(d) is not intended to
imply that commercial notes issued under a plan that matures more than 1 year after the effective date of the
plan are automatically covered by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 since such notes may fall within another
exemption thereto.
One other point with respect to Section 1145 deserves comment. Section 1145(a)(3) grants a debtor in
possession or trustee in chapter 11 an extremely narrow portfolio security exemption from section 5 of the
Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77e] or any comparable State law. The provision was considered by
Congress and adopted after much study. The exemption is reasonable and is more restrictive than comparable
provisions under the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.] relating to the estates of decedents. Subsequent to
passage of H.R. 8200 by the House of Representatives, the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated
Rule 148 to treat with this problem under existing law. Members of Congress received opinions from
attorneys indicating dissatisfaction with the Commission's rule although the rule has been amended, the
ultimate limitation of 1 percent promulgated by the Commission is wholly unacceptable.
The Commission rule would permit a trustee or debtor in possession to distribute securities at the rate of 1
percent every 6 months. Section 1145(a)(3) permits the trustee to distribute 4 percent of the securities during
the 2-year period immediately following the date of the filing of the petition. In addition, the security must be
of a reporting company under section 13 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78m], and
must be in compliance with all applicable requirements for the continuing of trading in the security on the date
that the trustee offers or sells the security.
With these safeguards the trustee or debtor in possession should be able to distribute 4 percent of the
securities of a class at any time during the 2-year period immediately following the date of the filing of the
petition in the interests of expediting bankruptcy administration. The same rationale that applies in
expeditiously terminating decedents' estates applies no less to an estate under title 11.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
This section, derived from similar provisions found in sections 264, 393, and 518 of the Bankruptcy Act
[sections 664, 793, and 918 of former title 11], provides a limited exemption from the securities laws for
securities issued under a plan of reorganization and for certain other securities. Subsection (a) exempts from
the requirements of section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77e] and from any State or local law
requiring registration or licensing of an issuer of, underwriter of, or broker or dealer in, a security, the offer or
sale of certain securities.
Paragraph (1) of subsection (a) exempts the offer or sale under section 364 of any security that is not an
equity security or convertible into an equity security. This paragraph is designed to facilitate the issuance of
certificates of indebtedness, and should be read in light of the amendment made in section 306 of title III to
section 3(a)(7) of the 1933 act [15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(7)].
Paragraph (2) of subsection (a) exempts the offer or sale of any security of the debtor, a successor to the
debtor, or an affiliate in a joint plan, distributed under a plan if such security is exchanged in principal part for
securities of the debtor or for allowed claims or administrative expenses. This exemption is carried over from
present law, except as to administrative claims, but is limited to prevent distribution of securities to other than
claim holders or equity security holders of the debtor or the estate.
Paragraph (3) of subsection (a) exempts the offer or sale of any security that arises from the exercise of a
subscription right or from the exercise of a conversion privilege when such subscription right or conversion
privilege was issued under a plan. This exemption is necessary in order to enhance the marketability of
subscription rights or conversion privileges, including warrants, offered or sold under a plan. This is present
law.
Paragraph (4) of subsection (a) exempts sales of portfolio securities, excluding securities of the debtor or its
affiliate, owned by the debtor on the date of the filing of the petition. The purpose of this exemption is to
allow the debtor or trustee to sell or distribute, without allowing manipulation schemes, restricted portfolio
securities held or acquired by the debtor. Subparagraph (B) of section 1145(a)(4) limits the exemption to
securities of a company that is required to file reports under section 13 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 78m]
and that is in compliance with all requirements for the continuance of trading those securities. This limitation
effectively prevents selling into the market "cats and dogs" of a nonreporting company. Subparagraph (C)
places a limitation on the amount of restricted securities that may be distributed. During the case, the trustee
may sell up to 4 percent of each class of restricted securities at any time during the first 2 years and 1 percent
[Release Point 118-106]
during any 180-day period thereafter. This relaxation of the resale rules for debtors in holding restricted
securities is similar to but less extensive than the relaxation in SEC Rule 114(c)(3)(v) for the estates of
deceased holders of securities.
Paragraph (5) contains an exemption for brokers and dealers (stockbrokers, as defined in title 11) akin to the
exemption provided by section 4(3)(A) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77d(3)(A)]. Instead of being
required to supply a prospectus, however, the stockbroker is required to supply the approved disclosure
statement, and if the court orders, information supplementing the disclosure statement. Under present law, the
stockholder is not required to supply anything.
Subsection (b) is new. The subsection should be read in light of the amendment in section 306 of title III to
the 1933 act [15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(7), (9), (10)]. It specifies the standards under which a creditor, equity security
holder, or other entity acquiring securities under the plan may resell them. The Securities Act places
limitations on sales by underwriters. This subsection defines who is an underwriter, and thus restricted, and
who is free to resell. Paragraph (1) enumerates real underwriters that participate in a classical underwriting. A
person is an underwriter if he purchases a claim against, interest in, or claim for an administrative expense in
the case concerning, the debtor, with a view to distribution or interest. This provision covers the purchase of a
certificate of indebtedness issued under proposed 11 U.S.C. 364 and purchased from the debtor, if the
purchase of the certificate was with a view to distribution.
A person is also an underwriter if he offers to sell securities offered or sold under the plan for the holders of
such securities, or offers to buy securities offered or sold under the plan from the holders of such securities, if
the offer to buy is with a view to distribution of the securities and under an agreement made in connection
with the plan, with the consummation of the plan or with the offer or sale of securities under the plan. Finally,
a person is an underwriter if he is an issuer, as used in section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C.
77b(11)].
Paragraph (2) of subsection (b) exempts from the definition of underwriter any entity to the extent that any
agreement that would bring the entity under the definition in paragraph (1) provides only for the matching
combination of fractional interests in the covered securities or the purchase or sale of fractional interests. This
paragraph and paragraph (1) are modeled after former rule 133 of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Paragraph (3) specifies that if an entity is not an underwriter under the provisions of paragraph (1), as
limited by paragraph (2), then the entity is not an underwriter for the purposes of the Securities Act of 1933
[15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.] with respect to the covered securities, that is, those offered or sold in an exempt
transaction specified in subsection (a)(2). This makes clear that the current definition of underwriter in section
2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77b(11)] does not apply to such a creditor. The definition in
that section technically applies to any person that purchases securities with "a view to distribution." If literally
applied, it would prevent any creditor in a bankruptcy case from selling securities received without filing a
registration statement or finding another exemption.
Subsection (b) is a first run transaction exemption and does not exempt a creditor that, for example, some
years later becomes an underwriter by reacquiring securities originally issued under a plan.
Subsection (c) makes an offer or sale of securities under the plan in an exempt transaction (as specified in
subsection (a)(2)) a public offering, in order to prevent characterization of the distribution as a "private
placement" which would result in restrictions, under rule 144 of the SEC, on the resale of the securities.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1146 of the House amendment represents a compromise between the House bill and Senate
amendment.
Special tax provisions: reorganization: The House bill provided rules on the effect of bankruptcy on the
taxable year of the debtor and on tax return filing requirements for State and local taxes only. The House bill
also exempted from State or local stamp taxes the issuance, transfer, or exchange of a security, or the making
or delivery of an instrument of transfer under a plan. The House bill also authorized the bankruptcy court to
declare the tax effects of a reorganization plan after the proponent of the plan had requested a ruling from
State or local tax authority and either had received an unfavorable ruling or the tax authority had not issued a
ruling within 270 days.
The Senate amendment deleted the rules concerning the taxable years of the debtor and tax return filing
requirements since the Federal rules were to be considered in the next Congress. It broadened the rule
[Release Point 118-106]
exempting transfers of securities to include Federal stamp or similar taxes, if any. In addition, the Senate
amendment deleted the provision which permitted the bankruptcy court to determine the tax effects of a plan.
The House amendment retains the State and local rules in the House bill with one modification. Under the
House amendment, the power of the bankruptcy court to declare the tax effects of the plan is limited to issues
of law and not to questions of fact such as the allowance of specific deductions. Thus, the bankruptcy court
could declare whether the reorganization qualified for taxfree status under State or local tax rules, but it could
not declare the dollar amount of any tax attributes that survive the reorganization.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 1146 provides special tax rules applicable to Title 11 reorganizations. Subsection (a) provides that
the taxable period of an individual debtor terminates on the date of the order for relief, unless the case has
been converted into a reorganization from a liquidation proceeding.
Subsection (b) requires the trustee of the estate of an individual debtor in a reorganization to file a tax return
for each taxable period while the case is pending after the order for relief. For corporations in chapter 11, the
trustee is required to file the tax returns due while the case is pending (sec. 346(c)(2)).
Subsection (c) exempts from Federal, State, or local stamp taxes the issuance, transfer, or exchange of a
security, or the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer under a plan. This subsection is derived from
section 267 of the present Bankruptcy Act [section 667 of former title 11].
Subsection (d) permits the court to authorize the proponent of a reorganization plan to request from the
Internal Revenue Service (or State or local tax authority) an advance ruling on the tax effects of the proposed
plan. If a ruling is not obtained within 270 days after the request was made, or if a ruling is obtained but the
proponent of the plan disagrees with the ruling, the bankruptcy court may resolve the dispute and determine
the tax effects of the proposed plan.
Subsection (e) provides that prepetition taxes which are nondischargeable in a reorganization, and all taxes
arising during the administration period of the case, may be assessed and collected from the debtor or the
debtor's successor in a reorganization (see sec. 505(c) of the bill).
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Section 1146 of title 11 specifies five subsections which embody special tax provisions that apply in a case
under chapter 11 of title 11. Subsection (a) indicates that the tax year of an individual debtor terminates on the
date of the order for relief under chapter 11. Termination of the taxable year of the debtor commences the tax
period of the estate. If the case was converted from chapter 7 of title 11 then the estate is created as a separate
taxable entity dating from the order for relief under chapter 7. If multiple conversion of the case occurs, then
the estate is treated as a separate taxable entity on the date of the order for relief under the first chapter under
which the estate is a separate taxable entity.
Subsection (d) permits the court to authorize the proponent of a plan to request a taxing authority to declare
the tax effects of such plan. In the event of an actual controversy, the court may declare the tax effects of the
plan of reorganization at any time after the earlier of action by such taxing authority or 270 days after the
request. Such a declaration, unless appealed, becomes a final judgment and binds any tax authority that was
requested by the proponent to determine the tax effects of the plan.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1163 of the House amendment represents a compromise between the House bill and Senate
amendment with respect to the appointment of a trustee in a railroad reorganization. As soon as practicable
after the order for relief, the Secretary of Transportation is required to submit a list of five disinterested
persons who are qualified to serve as trustee and the court will than appoint one trustee from the list to serve
as trustee in the case.
The House amendment deletes section 1163 of the Senate amendment in order to cover intrastate railroads
in a case under subchapter IV of chapter 11. The bill does not confer jurisdiction on the Interstate Commerce
Commission with respect to intrastate railroads.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
[Section 1166 (enacted as section 1163)] Requires the court to appoint a trustee in every case. Since the
trustee may employ whatever help he needs, multiple trusteeships are unnecessary and add to the cost of
administration. The present requirement of section 77(c)(1) [section 205(c)(1) of former title 11] that the
trustee be approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission is unnecessary, since the trustee will be selected
either from the panel established under section 606(f) of title 28, or someone certified by the Director of the
Administrative Office of the United States Courts as qualified to become a member of that panel.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
[Section 1162] This section [enacted as section 1163] requires the appointment of an independent trustee in
a railroad reorganization case. The court may appoint one or more disinterested persons to serve as trustee in
the case.

Section 1164 of the House amendment is derived from section 1163 of the House bill. The section makes

(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2641.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1165 of the House amendment represents a modification of sections 1165 and 1167 of the Senate
amendment requiring the court and the trustee to consider the broad, general public interest in addition to the
interests of the debtor, creditors, and equity security holders in applying specific sections of the subchapter.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 1165 requires the court, in consideration of the relief to be granted upon the filing of an involuntary
petition, to take into account the "public interest" in the preservation of the debtor's rail service. This is an
important factor in railroad reorganization, which distinguishes them from other business reorganizations.
Hence, this section modifies the provisions in sections 303 and 305 that govern generally when the business of
a debtor may continue to operate, when relief under the Act sought should be granted, and when the petition
should be dismissed.
Section 1167 [enacted as section 1165] imposes on the trustee the obligations, in addition to his other duties
and responsibilities, to take into account the "public interest" in the preservation of the debtor's rail service.
§1166. Effect of subtitle IV of title 49 and of Federal, State, or local regulations
Except with respect to abandonment under section 1170 of this title, or merger, modification of the
financial structure of the debtor, or issuance or sale of securities under a plan, the trustee and the
debtor are subject to the provisions of subtitle IV of title 49 that are applicable to railroads, and the
trustee is subject to orders of any Federal, State, or local regulatory body to the same extent as the
debtor would be if a petition commencing the case under this chapter had not been filed, but—
(1) any such order that would require the expenditure, or the incurring of an obligation for the
expenditure, of money from the estate is not effective unless approved by the court; and
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) the provisions of this chapter are subject to section 601(b) of the Regional Rail
Reorganization Act of 1973.

LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1166 of the House amendment is derived from sections 1164 and 1165 of the House bill. An
alternative proposal contained in section 1168(1) of the Senate bill is rejected as violative of the principle of
equal treatment of all creditors under title 11.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 1168 [enacted as section 1166] makes the trustee subject to the Interstate Commerce Act [49 U.S.C.
10101 et seq.] and to lawful orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the U.S. Department of
Transportation, and State and regulatory bodies. The approval of the court is required, however, if the order
requires the expenditure of money or the incurring of an expenditure other than the payment of certain
interline accounts. The limitation of "lawful orders" of State commissions to those involving "safety, location
of tracks, and terminal facilities," which is contained in present section 77(c)(2) [section 205(c)(2) of former
title 11], is eliminated.
Subsection (1) further provides that the debtor must pay in cash all amounts owed other carriers for current
balances owed for interline freight, passenger and per diem, including incentive per diem, for periods both
prior and subsequent to the filing of the petition, without the necessity of court approval.
Subsection (2) makes the provisions of the chapter subject to section 601(b) of the Regional Rail
Reorganization Act [45 U.S.C. 791(b)], which excludes the Interstate Commerce Commission from any
participation in the reorganization of certain northeast railroads that have transferred their rail properties to
Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail).
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Section 1164 [enacted as section 1166] makes the debtor railroad subject to the provisions of the Interstate
Commerce Act [49 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.] that are applicable to railroads, and the trustee subject to the orders
of the Interstate Commerce Commission to the same extent as the debtor would have been if the case had not
been commenced. There are several exceptions. The section does not apply with respect to abandonment of
rail lines, which is provided for under section 1169, or with respect to merger under a plan, modification of the
financial structure of the debtor by reason of the plan, or the issuance or sale of securities under a plan.
Further, the orders of the ICC are not effective if the order would require the expenditure or the incurring of
an obligation for the expenditure of money from the estate, unless approved by the court, and the provisions of
this chapter are subject to section 601(b) of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 [45 U.S.C. 791(b)].
[Section 1165 (enacted as section 1166)] The same rules apply with respect to Federal, State, or local
regulations. The trustee is subject to the orders of a Federal, State, or local regulatory body to the same extent
as the debtor would be if the case had not been commenced. However, any order that would require the
expenditure, or the incurring of an obligation for the expenditure, of money is not effective under [until]
approved by the court.

subcommittee this section provided that wages and salaries of rail employees could not be affected by the
trustee, but that work rules could be rejected by the trustee. The reorganization court was given the authority
to review the trustee's decisions and to settle any disputes arising from the rejection. This provision was
withdrawn by the full committee, and hearings will be conducted next year by the Human Resources
Committee in the area of rail labor contracts and the trustee's ability to reject them in a bankruptcy situation.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1168 of the House amendment incorporates a provision contained in section 1166 of the House bill
instead of the provision contained in section 1175 of the Senate amendment for the reasons stated in
connection with the discussion of section 1110 of the House amendment.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 1175 [enacted as section 1168] continues the protection accorded in present section 77(j) [section
205(j) of former title 11] to the rights of holders of purchase-money equipment security, and of lessors or
conditional vendors of railroad rolling stock, but accords to the trustee a limited period within which to
assume the debtor's obligation and to cure any defaults. The rights of such lenders are not affected by the
automatic stay and related provisions of sections 362 and 363, or by any power of the court, unless (1) within
60 days after the commencement of the case (or such longer period as may be agreed to by the secured party,
lessor or conditional vendor) the trustees, with the approval of the court, agrees to perform all of the debtor's
obligations under the security agreement, lease or conditional sale contract, and (2) all defaults are cured
within the 60-day period. Defaults described in section 365(b)(2)—defaults which are breaches of provisions
relating to the insolvency or financial condition of the debtor, or the commencement of a case under this title,
or the appointment of a trustee—are for obvious reasons, excepted.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
[Section 1166] This section [enacted as section 1168], derived with changes from the last sentence of
present section 77(j) [section 205(j) of former title 11], protects the interests of rolling stock equipment
financers, while providing the trustee with some opportunity to cure defaults, agree to make payments, and
retain and use the equipment. The provision is parallel to section 1110, concerning aircraft equipment and
vessels.

interest granted by, leased to, or conditionally sold to, the debtor to take possession of such equipment in
compliance with the provisions of a purchase-money equipment security agreement, lease, or conditional sale
contract, as the case may be, is not affected by section 362 or 363 of this title or by any power of the court to

Section 1169 of the Senate amendment is deleted from the House amendment as unnecessary since 28
U.S.C. 1407 treating with the judicial panel on multi-district litigation will apply by its terms to cases under
title 11.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 1177 [enacted as section 1169] continues, essentially without change, the provisions relating to the
rejection by the trustee of a lease of a line of railroad now contained in section 77(c)(6) [section 205(c)(6) of
former title 11]. Subsection (a) requires the lessor of a line of railroad to operate it if the lease is rejected by
the trustee and the trustee, with the approval of the court, elects not to operate the leased line. Subsection (b),
however, further provides that if operation by the lessor is impractical or contrary to the public interest, the
court shall require the trustee to operate the line for the account of the lessor until the operation is lawfully
terminated. Subsection (c) provides that during such operation, the lessor is a carrier subject to the Interstate
Commerce Act [49 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.].
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
[Section 1168] This section [enacted as section 1169] governs the effect of the rejection by the trustee of an
unexpired lease of railroad line under which the debtor is the lessee. If the trustee rejects such a lease, and if
the trustee, within such time as the court allows, and with the approval of the court, elects not to operate the
leased line, then the lessor under the lease must operate the line.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subsection (b) excuses the lessor from the requirement to operate the line under certain circumstances. If
operation of the line by the lessor is impracticable or contrary to the public interest, the court, on request of the
lessor, must order the trustee to continue operation of the line for the account of the lessor until abandonment
is ordered under section 1169, governing abandonments generally, or until the operation is otherwise lawfully
terminated, such as by an order of the ICC.
Subsection (c) deems the lessor a carrier subject to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act [49
U.S.C. 10101 et seq.] during the operation of the line before abandonment.

§1170. Abandonment of railroad line
(a) The court, after notice and a hearing, may authorize the abandonment of all or a portion of a
railroad line if such abandonment is—
(1)(A) in the best interest of the estate; or
(B) essential to the formulation of a plan; and
(2) consistent with the public interest.
(b) If, except for the pendency of the case under this chapter, such abandonment would require
approval by the Board under a law of the United States, the trustee shall initiate an appropriate
application for such abandonment with the Board. The court may fix a time within which the Board
shall report to the court on such application.
(c) After the court receives the report of the Board, or the expiration of the time fixed under
subsection (b) of this section, whichever occurs first, the court may authorize such abandonment,
after notice to the Board, the Secretary of Transportation, the trustee, any party in interest that has
requested notice, any affected shipper or community, and any other entity prescribed by the court,
and a hearing.
(d)(1) Enforcement of an order authorizing such abandonment shall be stayed until the time for
taking an appeal has expired, or, if an appeal is timely taken, until such order has become final.
(2) If an order authorizing such abandonment is appealed, the court, on request of a party in
interest, may authorize suspension of service on a line or a portion of a line pending the
determination of such appeal, after notice to the Board, the Secretary of Transportation, the trustee,
any party in interest that has requested notice, any affected shipper or community, and any other
entity prescribed by the court, and a hearing. An appellant may not obtain a stay of the enforcement
of an order authorizing such suspension by the giving of a supersedeas bond or otherwise, during the
pendency of such appeal.
(e)(1) In authorizing any abandonment of a railroad line under this section, the court shall require
the rail carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees as that
established under section 11326(a) of title 49.
(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to affect the priorities or timing of payment of
employee protection which might have existed in the absence of this subsection.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
[Release Point 118-106]
Subsection (a) of section 1178 [enacted as section 1170] permits the court to authorize the abandonment of
a railroad line if the abandonment is consistent with the public interest and either in the best interest of the
estate or essential to the formulation of a plan. This avoids the normal abandonment requirements of generally
applicable railroad regulatory law.
Subsection (b) permits some participation by the Interstate Commerce Commission in the abandonment
process. The Commission's role, however, is only advisory. The Commission will represent the public interest,
while the trustee and various creditors and equity security holders will represent the interests of those who
have invested money in the enterprise. The court will balance the various interests and make an appropriate
decision. The subsection specifies that if, except for the pendency of the railroad reorganization case, the
proposed abandonment would require Commission approval, then the trustee, with the approval of the court,
must initiate an application for the abandonment with the Commission. The court may then fix a time within
which the Commission must report to the court on the application.
Subsection (c) permits the court to act after it has received the report of the Commission or the time fixed
under subsection (b) has expired, whichever occurs first. The court may then authorize the abandonment after
notice and a hearing. The notice must go to the Commission, the Secretary of Transportation, the trustee, and
party in interest that has requested notice, any affected shipper or community, and any other entity that the
court specifies.
Subsection (d) stays the enforcement of an abandonment until the time for taking an appeal has expired, or
if an appeal has been taken, until the order has become final. However, the court may, and after notice and a
hearing, on request of a party in interest authorize termination of service on the line or a portion of the line
pending the determination of the appeal. The notice required is the same as that required under subsection (c).
If the court authorizes termination of service pending determination of the appeal, an appellant may not obtain
a stay of the enforcement of the order authorizing termination, either by the giving of a supersedeas bond or
otherwise, during the pendency of the appeal.

operation of the debtor railroad or the estate, whether the claim arose before or after commencement of the
case. The priority under current law, found in section 77(n) [section 205(n) of former title 11], applies only to
employees of the debtor. This subsection expands the protection provided.
Subsection (b) follows present section 77(b) of the Bankruptcy Act [section 205(b) of former title 11] by
giving priority to any unsecured claims that would be entitled to priority if a receiver in equity of the property
of the debtor had been appointed by a Federal court on the date of the order for relief under the bankruptcy
laws. As under current law, the courts will determine the precise contours of the priority recognized by this

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1172 of the House amendment is derived from section 1171 of the House bill in preference to
section 1170 of the Senate amendment with the exception that section 1170(4) of the Senate amendment is
incorporated into section 1172(a)(1) of the House amendment.
Section 1172(b) of the House amendment is derived from section 1171(c) of the Senate amendment. The
section gives the Interstate Commerce Commission the exclusive power to approve or disapprove the transfer
of, or operation of or over, any of the debtor's rail lines over which the Commission has jurisdiction, subject to
review under the Administrative Procedures Act [5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. and 701 et seq.]. The section does not
apply to a transfer of railroad lines to a successor of the debtor under a plan of reorganization by merger or
otherwise.
The House amendment deletes section 1171(a) of the Senate amendment as a matter to be determined by
the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. It is anticipated that the rules will specify the period of time, such as 18
months, within which a trustee must file with the court a proposed plan of reorganization for the debtor or a
report why a plan cannot be formulated. Incorporation by reference of section 1121 in section 1161 of title 11
means that a party in interest will also have a right to file a plan of reorganization. This differs from the
position taken in the Senate amendment which would have permitted the Interstate Commerce Commission to
file a plan of reorganization.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 1170 adds to the general provisions required or permitted in reorganization plans by section 1123.
Subsection (1) requires that a reorganization plan under the railroad subchapter specify the means by which
the value of the claims of creditors and the interests of equity holders which are materially and adversely
affected by the plan are to be realized. Subsection (2) permits a plan to include provisions for the issuance of
warrants. Subsection (3) requires that the plan provide for fixed charges by probable earnings for their
payment. Subsection (4) requires that the plan specify the means by which, and the extent to which, the
debtor's rail service is to be continued, and shall identify any rail service to be terminated. Subsection (5)
permits other appropriate provisions not inconsistent with the chapter. With the exception of subsection (4),
the requirements are comparable to those of present section 77(b) [section 205(b) of former title 11];
subsection (4) emphasizes the public interest in the preservation of rail transportation.
Section 1171 imposes on the court, rather than the Interstate Commerce Commission, as in present section
[Release Point 118-106]
77 [section 205 of former title 11], the responsibility for the plan of reorganization. The Commission is
empowered to make final decisions subject only to review by the court under the standards of the
Administrative Procedure Act [5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. and 701 et seq.] as to any part of the plan which deals with
transportation matters, such as the grant of operating rights of or over, or transfer of, the debtor's rail lines to
other carriers.
Subsection (a) requires the trustee to file a plan of reorganization within 18 months after the petition is
filed, and permits the court, for good cause shown, to extend such time limit. Subsection (b) permits a plan to
be proposed by any interested person, and permits the trustee to revise his plan at any time before it is
approved by the court.
Subsections (c), (d) and (e) require the court, when a plan is submitted by the trustee or, if the court deems
it worthy of consideration, a plan submitted is proposed by any other person proposes the transfer of, or
operation of or over, any of the debtor's lines by other carriers, to refer to such provisions of the plan to the
Interstate Commerce Commission. The Commission, within 240 days, and after a hearing if the Commission
so determines, is to report to the court the effects of such provisions of the plan in the light of national
transportation policy and sections 5(3)(f)(A), (B), and (D), (F)–(I) of the Interstate Commerce Act [49 U.S.C.
11350(b)(1), (2), (4), (6)–(9)]. The report of the Commission is conclusive in all further hearings on the plan
by the court, subject only to review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A)–(D).
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
[Section 1171 (enacted as section 1172)] A plan in a railroad reorganization case may include provisions in
addition to those required and permitted under an ordinary reorganization plan. It may provide for the transfer
of any or all of the operating railroad lines of the debtor to another operating railroad.
Paragraph (1) contemplates a liquidating plan for the debtor's rail lines, much as occurred in the Penn
Central case by transfer of operating lines to ConRail. Such a liquidating plan is not per se contrary to the
public interest, and the court will have to determine on a case-by-case basis, with the guidance of the Interstate
Commerce Commission and of other parties in interest, whether the particular plan proposed is in the public
interest, as required under proposed 11 U.S.C. 1172(3).
The plan may also provide for abandonment in accordance with section 1169, governing abandonment
generally. Neither of these provisions in a plan, transfer or abandonment of lines, requires ICC approval.
Confirmation of the plan by the court authorizes the debtor to comply with the plan in accordance with section
1142(a) notwithstanding any bankruptcy law to the contrary.

§1173. Confirmation of plan
(a) The court shall confirm a plan if—
(1) the applicable requirements of section 1129 of this title have been met;
(2) each creditor or equity security holder will receive or retain under the plan property of a
value, as of the effective date of the plan, that is not less than the value of property that each such
creditor or equity security holder would so receive or retain if all of the operating railroad lines of
the debtor were sold, and the proceeds of such sale, and the other property of the estate, were
distributed under chapter 7 of this title on such date;
(3) in light of the debtor's past earnings and the probable prospective earnings of the
reorganized debtor, there will be adequate coverage by such prospective earnings of any fixed
charges, such as interest on debt, amortization of funded debt, and rent for leased railroads,
provided for by the plan; and
(4) the plan is consistent with the public interest.
(b) If the requirements of subsection (a) of this section are met with respect to more than one plan,
the court shall confirm the plan that is most likely to maintain adequate rail service in the public
interest.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1173 of the House amendment concerns confirmation of a plan of railroad reorganization and is
derived from section 1172 of the House bill as modified. In particular, section 1173(a)(3) of the House
amendment is derived from section 1170(3) of the Senate amendment. Section 1173(b) is derived from section
1173(a)(8) of the Senate amendment.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 1173 adapts the provisions dealing with reorganization plans generally contained in section 1130 to
the particular requirements of railroad reorganization plans, as set out in present section 77(e) [section 205(e)
of former title 11]. Subsection (a) specifies the findings which the court must make before approving a plan:
(1) The plan complies with the applicable provisions of the chapter; (2) the proponent of the plan complies
with the applicable provisions of the chapter; (3) the plan has been proposed in good faith; (4) any payments
for services or for costs or expenses in connection with the case or the plan are disclosed to the court and are
reasonable, or, if to be paid later, are subject to the approval of the court as reasonable; (5) the proponent of
the plan has disclosed the identity and affiliations of the individuals who will serve as directors, officers, or
voting trustees, such appointments or continuations in office are consistent with the interests of creditors,
equity security holders, and the proponent the public, and has disclosed the identity and compensation of any
insider who will be employed or retained under the plan; (6) that rate changes proposed in the plan have been
approved by the appropriate regulatory commission, or that the plan is contingent on such approval; (7) that
confirmation of the plan is not likely to be followed by further reorganization or liquidation, unless it is
contemplated by the plan; (8) that the plan, if there is more than one, is the one most likely to maintain
adequate rail service and (9) that the plan provides the priority traditionally accorded by section 77(b) [section
205(b) of former title 11] to claims by rail creditors for necessary services rendered during the 6 months
preceding the filing of the petition in bankruptcy.
Subsection (b) continues the present power of the court in section 77(e) [section 205(e) of former title 11] to
confirm a plan over the objections of creditors or equity security holders who are materially and adversely
affected. The subsection also confirms the authority of the court to approve a transfer of all or part of a
debtor's property or its merger over the objections of equity security holders if it finds (1) that the "public
interest" in continued rail transportation outweighs any adverse effect on creditors and equity security holders,
and (2) that the plan is fair and equitable, affords due recognition to the rights of each class, and does not
discriminate unfairly against any class.
Subsection (c) permits modification of a plan confirmed by a final order only for fraud.
[Release Point 118-106]
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
[Section 1172] This section [enacted as section 1173] requires the court to confirm a plan if the applicable
requirements of section 1129 (relating to confirmation of reorganization plans generally) are met, if the best
interest test is met, and if the plan is compatible with the public interest.
The test in this paragraph is similar to the test prescribed for ordinary corporate reorganizations. However,
since a railroad cannot liquidate its assets and sell them for scrap to satisfy its creditors, the test focuses on the
value of the railroad as a going concern. That is, the test is based on what the assets, sold as operating rail
lines, would bring.
The public interest requirement, found in current law, will now be decided by the court, with the ICC
representing the public interest before the court, rather than in the first instance by the ICC. Liquidation of the
debtor is not, per se, contrary to the public interest.

§1174. Liquidation
On request of a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court may, or, if a plan has not
been confirmed under section 1173 of this title before five years after the date of the order for relief,
the court shall, order the trustee to cease the debtor's operation and to collect and reduce to money all
of the property of the estate in the same manner as if the case were a case under chapter 7 of this
title.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2644.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1174 of the House amendment represents a compromise between the House bill and Senate
amendment on the issue of liquidation of a railroad. The provision permits a party in interest at any time to
request liquidation. In addition, if a plan has not been confirmed under section 1173 of the House amendment
before 5 years after the date of order for relief, the court must order the trustee to cease the debtor's operation
and to collect and reduce to money all of the property of the estate in the same manner as if the case were a
case under chapter 7 of title 11. The approach differs from the conversion to chapter 7 under section 1174 of
the Senate bill in order to make special provisions contained in subchapter IV of chapter 11 applicable to
liquidation. However, maintaining liquidation in the context of chapter 11 is not intended to delay liquidation
of the railroad to a different extent than if the case were converted to chapter 7.
Although the House amendment does not adopt provisions contained in sections 1170(1), (2), (3), or (5), of
the Senate amendment such provisions are contained explicitly or implicitly in section 1123 of the House
amendment.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 1174 permits the court to convert the case to a liquidation under chapter 7 if the court finds that the
debtor cannot be reorganized, or if various time limits specified in the subchapter are not met. Section 77
[section 205 of former title 11] does not authorize a liquidation of a railroad under the Bankruptcy Act [former
title 11]. If the railroad is not reorganizable, the only action open to the court is to dismiss the petition, which
would in all likelihood be followed by a State court receivership, with all of its attendant disadvantages. If
reorganization is impossible, the debtor should be liquidated under the Bankruptcy Act.

unaffected the rights of holders of any class of claims;
(3) provide for the curing or waiving of any default;

any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor not previously rejected under such section;
(7) provide for the payment of all or part of a claim against the debtor from property of the
estate or property of the debtor;
(8) provide for the sale of all or any part of the property of the estate or the distribution of all or

time, in the debtor or in any other entity;
(11) provide for the payment of interest accruing after the date of the filing of the petition on
unsecured claims that are nondischargeable under section 1228(a), except that such interest may
be paid only to the extent that the debtor has disposable income available to pay such interest after
making provision for full payment of all allowed claims; and
(12) include any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with this title.
(c) Except as provided in subsections (b)(5) and (b)(9), the plan may not provide for payments
over a period that is longer than three years unless the court for cause approves a longer period, but
the court may not approve a period that is longer than five years.
(d) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2) of this section and sections 506(b) and 1225(a)(5) of this

(d) On request of a party in interest before one year after a discharge under this section is granted,
and after notice and a hearing, the court may revoke such discharge only if—
(1) such discharge was obtained by the debtor through fraud; and
(2) the requesting party did not know of such fraud until after such discharge was granted.
(e) After the debtor is granted a discharge, the court shall terminate the services of any trustee
serving in the case.
(f) The court may not grant a discharge under this chapter unless the court after notice and a
hearing held not more than 10 days before the date of the entry of the order granting the discharge
finds that there is no reasonable cause to believe that—
(1) section 522(q)(1) may be applicable to the debtor; and
(2) there is pending any proceeding in which the debtor may be found guilty of a felony of the
kind described in section 522(q)(1)(A) or liable for a debt of the kind described in section

§1229. Modification of plan after confirmation
(a) At any time after confirmation of the plan but before the completion of payments under such
plan, the plan may be modified, on request of the debtor, the trustee, or the holder of an allowed
unsecured claim, to—
(1) increase or reduce the amount of payments on claims of a particular class provided for by
the plan;

(d) A plan may not be modified under this section—
(1) to increase the amount of any payment due before the plan as modified becomes the plan;
(2) by anyone except the debtor, based on an increase in the debtor's disposable income, to
increase the amount of payments to unsecured creditors required for a particular month so that the
aggregate of such payments exceeds the debtor's disposable income for such month; or
(3) in the last year of the plan by anyone except the debtor, to require payments that would
leave the debtor with insufficient funds to carry on the farming operation after the plan is
completed.

§1301. Stay of action against codebtor
(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, after the order for relief under this
chapter, a creditor may not act, or commence or continue any civil action, to collect all or any part of
a consumer debt of the debtor from any individual that is liable on such debt with the debtor, or that
secured such debt, unless—
(1) such individual became liable on or secured such debt in the ordinary course of such
individual's business; or

(b) A creditor may present a negotiable instrument, and may give notice of dishonor of such an
instrument.
(c) On request of a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court shall grant relief from
the stay provided by subsection (a) of this section with respect to a creditor, to the extent that—
(1) as between the debtor and the individual protected under subsection (a) of this section, such
individual received the consideration for the claim held by such creditor;
(2) the plan filed by the debtor proposes not to pay such claim; or
(3) such creditor's interest would be irreparably harmed by continuation of such stay.
(d) Twenty days after the filing of a request under subsection (c)(2) of this section for relief from
the stay provided by subsection (a) of this section, such stay is terminated with respect to the party in
interest making such request, unless the debtor or any individual that is liable on such debt with the
debtor files and serves upon such party in interest a written objection to the taking of the proposed
action.

Stat. 355, 388.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1301 of the House amendment is identical with the provision contained in section 1301 of the
House bill and adopted by the Senate amendment. Section 1301(c)(1) indicates that a basis for lifting the stay
[Release Point 118-106]
is that the debtor did not receive consideration for the claim by the creditor, or in other words, the debtor is
really the "codebtor." As with other sections in title 11, the standard of receiving consideration is a general
rule, but where two co-debtors have agreed to share liabilities in a different manner than profits it is the
individual who does not ultimately bear the liability that is protected by the stay under section 1301.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) automatically stays the holder of a claim based on a consumer debt of the chapter 13 debtor
from acting or proceeding in any way, except as authorized pursuant to subsections (b) and (c), against an
individual or the property of an individual liable with the chapter 13 debtor, unless such codebtor became
liable in the ordinary course of his business, or unless the case is closed, dismissed, or converted to another
chapter.
Under the terms of the agreement with the codebtor who is not in bankruptcy, the creditor has a right to
collect all payments to the extent they are not made by the debtor at the time they are due. To the extent to
which a chapter 13 plan does not propose to pay a creditor his claims, the creditor may obtain relief from the
court from the automatic stay and collect such claims from the codebtor. Conversely, a codebtor obtains the
benefit of any payments made to the creditor under the plan. If a debtor defaults on scheduled payments under
the plan, then the codebtor would be liable for the remaining deficiency; otherwise, payments not made under
the plan may never be made by the codebtor. The obligation of the codebtor to make the creditor whole at the
time payments are due remains.
The automatic stay under this section pertains only to the collection of a consumer debt, defined by section
101(7) of this title to mean a debt incurred by an individual primarily for a personal, family, or household
purpose. Therefore, not all debts owed by a chapter 13 debtor will be subject to the stay of the codebtor,
particularly those business debts incurred by an individual with regular income, as defined by section 101(24)
of this title, engaged in business, that is permitted by virtue of section 109(b) and section 1304 to obtain
chapter 13 relief.
Subsection (b) excepts the giving of notice of dishonor of a negotiable instrument from the reach of the
codebtor stay.
Under subsection (c), if the codebtor has property out of which the creditor's claim can be satisfied, the
court can grant relief from the stay absent the transfer of a security interest in that property by the codebtor to
the creditor. Correspondingly, if there is reasonable cause to believe that property is about to be disposed of by
the codebtor which could be used to satisfy his obligation to the creditor, the court should lift the stay to allow
the creditor to perfect his rights against such property. Likewise, if property is subject to rapid depreciation or
decrease in value the stay should be lifted to allow the creditor to protect his rights to reach such property.
Otherwise, the creditor's interest would be irreparably harmed by such stay. Property which could be used to
satisfy the claim could be disposed of or encumbered and placed beyond the reach of the creditor. The creditor
should be allowed to protect his rights to reach property which could satisfy his claim and prevent its erosion
in value, disposal, or encumbrance.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
This section is new. It is designed to protect a debtor operating under a chapter 13 individual repayment
plan case by insulating him from indirect pressures from his creditors exerted through friends or relatives that
may have cosigned an obligation of the debtor. The protection is limited, however, to ensure that the creditor
involved does not lose the benefit of the bargain he made for a cosigner. He is entitled to full compensation,
including any interest, fees, and costs provided for by the agreement under which the debtor obtained his loan.
The creditor is simply required to share with other creditors to the extent that the debtor will repay him under
the chapter 13 plan. The creditor is delayed, but his substantive rights are not affected.
Subsection (a) is the operative subsection. It stays action by a creditor after an order for relief under chapter
13. The creditor may not act, or commence or continue any civil action, to collect all or any part of a
consumer debt of the debtor from any individual that is liable on such debt with the debtor, or that has secured
the debt, unless the individual became liable or secured the debt in the ordinary course of his business, or the
case is closed, dismissed, or converted to chapter 7 or 11.
Subsection (b) permits the creditor, notwithstanding the stay, to present a negotiable instrument and to give
notice of dishonor of the instrument, in order to preserve his substantive rights against the codebtor as required
by applicable nonbankruptcy law.
Subsection (c) requires the court to grant relief from the stay in certain circumstances. The court must grant
relief to the extent that the debtor does not propose to pay, under the plan, the amount owed to the creditor.
The court must also grant relief to the extent that the debtor was really the codebtor in the transaction, that is,
to the extent that the nondebtor party actually received the consideration for the claim held by the creditor.
Finally, the court must grant relief to the extent that the creditor's interest would be irreparably harmed by the

stay, for example, where the codebtor filed bankruptcy himself, or threatened to leave the locale, or lost his
job.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1302 of the House amendment adopts a provision contained in the Senate amendment instead of the
position taken in the House bill. Sections 1302(d) and (e) are modeled on the standing trustee system
contained in the House bill with the court assuming supervisory functions in districts not under the pilot
program.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
The principal administrator in a chapter 13 case is the chapter 13 trustee. Experience under chapter XIII of
the Bankruptcy Act [chapter 13 of former title 11] has shown that the more efficient and effective wage earner
programs have been conducted by standing chapter XIII trustees who exercise a broad range of
responsibilities in both the design and the effectuation of debtor plans.
Subsection (a) provides administrative flexibility by permitting the bankruptcy judge to appoint an
individual from the panel of trustees established pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §604(f) and qualified under section 322
of title 11, either to serve as a standing trustee in all chapter 13 cases filed in the district or a portion thereof,
or to serve in a single case.
Subsection (b)(1) makes it clear that the chapter 13 trustee is no mere disbursing agent of the monies paid to
him by the debtor under the plan [section 1322(a)(1)], by imposing upon him certain relevant duties of a
liquidation trustee prescribed by section 704 of this title.
Subsection (b)(2) requires the chapter 13 trustee to appear before and be heard by the bankruptcy court
whenever the value of property secured by a lien or the confirmation or modification of a plan after
confirmation as provided by sections 1323–1325 is considered by the court.
Subsection (b)(3) requires the chapter 13 trustee to advise and counsel the debtor while under chapter 13,
except on matters more appropriately left to the attorney for the debtor. The chapter 13 trustee must also assist
the debtor in performance under the plan by attempting to tailor the requirements of the plan to the changing
needs and circumstances of the debtor during the extension period.
Subsection (c) imposes on the trustee in a chapter 13 case filed by a debtor engaged in business the
investigative and reporting duties normally required of a chapter 11 debtor or trustee as prescribed by section
1106(a)(3) and (4).
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (d) gives the trustee an additional duty if the debtor is engaged in business, as defined in section
1304. The trustee must perform the duties specified in sections 1106(a)(3) and 1106(a)(4), relating to
investigation of the debtor.

of this title.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2646.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1303 of the House amendment specifies rights and powers that the debtor has exclusive of the
trustees. The section does not imply that the debtor does not also possess other powers concurrently with the
trustee. For example, although section 1323 is not specified in section 1303, certainly it is intended that the
debtor has the power to sue and be sued.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
A chapter 13 debtor is vested with the identical rights and powers, and is subject to the same limitations in
regard to their exercise, as those given a liquidation trustee by virtue of section 363(b), (d), (e), (f), and (h) of
title 11, relating to the sale, use or lease of property.
§1304. Debtor engaged in business
(a) A debtor that is self-employed and incurs trade credit in the production of income from such
employment is engaged in business.
(b) Unless the court orders otherwise, a debtor engaged in business may operate the business of
the debtor and, subject to any limitations on a trustee under sections 363(c) and 364 of this title and
to such limitations or conditions as the court prescribes, shall have, exclusive of the trustee, the rights
and powers of the trustee under such sections.
(c) A debtor engaged in business shall perform the duties of the trustee specified in section

LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1304(b) of the House amendment adopts the approach taken in the comparable section of the Senate
amendment as preferable to the position taken in the House bill.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Increased access to the simpler, speedier, and less expensive debtor relief provisions of chapter 13 is
accomplished by permitting debtors engaged in business to proceed under chapter 13, provided their income is
sufficiently stable and regular to permit compliance with a chapter 13 plan [section 101(24)] and that the
debtor (or the debtor and spouse) do not owe liquidated, noncontingent unsecured debts of $50,000, or
liquidated, noncontingent secured debts of $200,000 (§109(d)).
Section 1304(a) states that a self-employed individual who incurs trade credit in the production of income is
a debtor engaged in business.
Subsection (b) empowers a chapter 13 debtor engaged in business to operate his business, subject to the
rights, powers and limitations that pertain to a trustee under sections 363(c) and 364 of title 11, and subject to
such further limitations and conditions as the court may prescribe.
Subsection (c) requires a chapter 13 debtor engaged in business to file with the court certain financial

(1) for taxes that become payable to a governmental unit while the case is pending; or
(2) that is a consumer debt, that arises after the date of the order for relief under this chapter,

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1305(a)(2) of the House amendment modifies similar provisions contained in the House and Senate
bills by restricting application of the paragraph to a consumer debt. Debts of the debtor that are not consumer
[Release Point 118-106]
debts should not be subjected to section 1305(c) or section 1328(d) of the House amendment.
Section 1305(b) of the House amendment represents a technical modification of similar provisions
contained in the House bill and Senate amendment.
The House amendment deletes section 1305(d) of the Senate amendment as unnecessary. Section 502(b)(1)
is sufficient to disallow any claim to the extent the claim represents the usurious interest or any other charge
forbidden by applicable law. It is anticipated that the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure may require a creditor
filing a proof of claim in a case under chapter 13 to include an affirmative statement as contemplated by
section 1305(d) of the Senate amendment.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Section 1305, exclusively applicable in chapter 13 cases, supplements the provisions of sections 501–511 of
title 11, dealing with the filing and allowance of claims. Sections 501–511 apply in chapter 13 cases by virtue
of section 103(a) of this title. Section 1305(a) provides for the filing of a proof of claim for taxes and other
obligations incurred after the filing of the chapter 13 case. Subsection (b) prescribes that section 502 of title 11
governs the allowance of section 1305(a) claims, except that its standards shall be applied as of the date of
allowance of the claim, rather than the date of filing of the petition. Subsection (c) requires the disallowance
of a postpetition claim for property or services necessary for the debtor's performance under the plan, if the
holder of the claim knew or should have known that prior approval by the trustee of the debtor's incurring of
the obligation was practicable and was not obtained.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (a) permits the filing of a proof of a claim against the debtor that is for taxes that become
payable to a governmental unit while the case is pending, or that arises after the date of the filing of the
petition for property or services that are necessary for the debtor's performance under the plan, such as auto
repairs in order that the debtor will be able to get to work, or medical bills. The effect of the latter provision,
in paragraph (2), is to treat postpetition credit extended to a chapter 13 debtor the same as a prepetition claim
for purposes of allowance, distribution, and so on.
§1306. Property of the estate
(a) Property of the estate includes, in addition to the property specified in section 541 of this
title—
(1) all property of the kind specified in such section that the debtor acquires after the
commencement of the case but before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted to a case under
chapter 7, 11, or 12 of this title, whichever occurs first; and
(2) earnings from services performed by the debtor after the commencement of the case but
before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted to a case under chapter 7, 11, or 12 of this title,
whichever occurs first.
(b) Except as provided in a confirmed plan or order confirming a plan, the debtor shall remain in
possession of all property of the estate.

Section 1307(a) is derived from the Senate amendment in preference to a comparable provision contained
in the House bill.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsections (a) and (b) confirm, without qualification, the rights of a chapter 13 debtor to convert the case
to a liquidating bankruptcy case under chapter 7 of title 11, at any time, or to have the chapter 13 case
dismissed. Waiver of any such right is unenforceable. Subsection (c) specifies various conditions for the
exercise of the power of the court to convert a chapter 13 case to one under chapter 7 or to dismiss the case.
Subsection (d) deals with the conversion of a chapter 13 case to one under chapter 11. Subsection (e) prohibits
conversion of the chapter 13 case filed by a farmer to chapter 7 or 11 except at the request of the debtor. No
case is to be converted from chapter 13 to any other chapter, unless the debtor is an eligible debtor under the
new chapter.
HOUSE REPORT NO. 95–595
Subsection (f) reinforces section 109 by prohibiting conversion to a chapter under which the debtor is not
eligible to proceed.

§1308. Filing of prepetition tax returns
(a) Not later than the day before the date on which the meeting of the creditors is first scheduled to

nonbankruptcy law, the debtor shall file with appropriate tax authorities all tax returns for all taxable
periods ending during the 4-year period ending on the date of the filing of the petition.
(b)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), if the tax returns required by subsection (a) have not been filed by
the date on which the meeting of creditors is first scheduled to be held under section 341(a), the
trustee may hold open that meeting for a reasonable period of time to allow the debtor an additional

The debtor shall file a plan.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2648.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Chapter 13 contemplates the filing of a plan only by the debtor.
§1322. Contents of plan
(a) The plan—
(1) shall provide for the submission of all or such portion of future earnings or other future
income of the debtor to the supervision and control of the trustee as is necessary for the execution
of the plan;
(2) shall provide for the full payment, in deferred cash payments, of all claims entitled to
priority under section 507 of this title, unless the holder of a particular claim agrees to a different
treatment of such claim;
(3) if the plan classifies claims, shall provide the same treatment for each claim within a
particular class; and
(4) notwithstanding any other provision of this section, may provide for less than full payment
of all amounts owed for a claim entitled to priority under section 507(a)(1)(B) only if the plan
provides that all of the debtor's projected disposable income for a 5-year period beginning on the
date that the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments under the plan.
(b) Subject to subsections (a) and (c) of this section, the plan may—
(1) designate a class or classes of unsecured claims, as provided in section 1122 of this title, but
may not discriminate unfairly against any class so designated; however, such plan may treat
claims for a consumer debt of the debtor if an individual is liable on such consumer debt with the
debtor differently than other unsecured claims;
(2) modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by a security
interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence, or of holders of unsecured claims,
or leave unaffected the rights of holders of any class of claims;
(3) provide for the curing or waiving of any default;
[Release Point 118-106]
(4) provide for payments on any unsecured claim to be made concurrently with payments on
any secured claim or any other unsecured claim;
(5) notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, provide for the curing of any default
within a reasonable time and maintenance of payments while the case is pending on any unsecured
claim or secured claim on which the last payment is due after the date on which the final payment
under the plan is due;
(6) provide for the payment of all or any part of any claim allowed under section 1305 of this
title;
(7) subject to section 365 of this title, provide for the assumption, rejection, or assignment of
any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor not previously rejected under such section;
(8) provide for the payment of all or part of a claim against the debtor from property of the
estate or property of the debtor;
(9) provide for the vesting of property of the estate, on confirmation of the plan or at a later
time, in the debtor or in any other entity;
(10) provide for the payment of interest accruing after the date of the filing of the petition on
unsecured claims that are nondischargeable under section 1328(a), except that such interest may
be paid only to the extent that the debtor has disposable income available to pay such interest after
making provision for full payment of all allowed claims; and
(11) include any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with this title.
(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2) and applicable nonbankruptcy law—
(1) a default with respect to, or that gave rise to, a lien on the debtor's principal residence may
be cured under paragraph (3) or (5) of subsection (b) until such residence is sold at a foreclosure
sale that is conducted in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law; and
(2) in a case in which the last payment on the original payment schedule for a claim secured
only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence is due before the
date on which the final payment under the plan is due, the plan may provide for the payment of the
claim as modified pursuant to section 1325(a)(5) of this title.
(d)(1) If the current monthly income of the debtor and the debtor's spouse combined, when
multiplied by 12, is not less than—
(A) in the case of a debtor in a household of 1 person, the median family income of the
applicable State for 1 earner;
(B) in the case of a debtor in a household of 2, 3, or 4 individuals, the highest median family
income of the applicable State for a family of the same number or fewer individuals; or
(C) in the case of a debtor in a household exceeding 4 individuals, the highest median family
income of the applicable State for a family of 4 or fewer individuals, plus $525 1 per month for
each individual in excess of 4,
the plan may not provide for payments over a period that is longer than 5 years.
(2) If the current monthly income of the debtor and the debtor's spouse combined, when multiplied
by 12, is less than—
(A) in the case of a debtor in a household of 1 person, the median family income of the
applicable State for 1 earner;
(B) in the case of a debtor in a household of 2, 3, or 4 individuals, the highest median family
income of the applicable State for a family of the same number or fewer individuals; or
(C) in the case of a debtor in a household exceeding 4 individuals, the highest median family
income of the applicable State for a family of 4 or fewer individuals, plus $525 1 per month for
each individual in excess of 4,
the plan may not provide for payments over a period that is longer than 3 years, unless the court,
for cause, approves a longer period, but the court may not approve a period that is longer than 5
years.
[Release Point 118-106]
(e) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2) of this section and sections 506(b) and 1325(a)(5) of this
title, if it is proposed in a plan to cure a default, the amount necessary to cure the default, shall be
determined in accordance with the underlying agreement and applicable nonbankruptcy law.
(f) A plan may not materially alter the terms of a loan described in section 362(b)(19) and any
amounts required to repay such loan shall not constitute "disposable income" under section 1325.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1322(b)(2) of the House amendment represents a compromise agreement between similar
provisions in the House bill and Senate amendment. Under the House amendment, the plan may modify the
rights of holders of secured claims other than a claim secured by a security interest in real property that is the
debtor's principal residence. It is intended that a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence may be
treated with under section 1322(b)(5) of the House amendment.
Section 1322(c) adopts a 5-year period derived from the House bill in preference to a 4-year period
contained in the Senate amendment. A conforming change is made in section 1329(c) adopting the provision
in the House bill in preference to a comparable provision in the Senate amendment.
Tax payments in wage earner plans: The House bill provided that a wage earner plan had to provide that all
priority claims would be paid in full. The Senate amendment contained a special rule in section 1325(c)
requiring that Federal tax claims must be paid in cash, but that such tax claims can be paid in deferred cash
installments under the general rules applicable to the payment of debts in a wage earner plan, unless the
Internal Revenue Service negotiates with the debtor for some different medium or time for payment of the tax
liability.
The House bill adopts the substance of the Senate amendment rule under section 1322(a)(2) of the House
amendment. A wage earner plan must provide for full payment in deferred cash payments, of all priority
claims, unless the holder of a particular claim agrees with a different treatment of such claim.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Chapter 13 is designed to serve as a flexible vehicle for the repayment of part or all of the allowed claims of
the debtor. Section 1322 emphasizes that purpose by fixing a minimum of mandatory plan provisions.
Subsection (a) requires that the plan submit whatever portion of the future income of the debtor is necessary
to implement the plan to the control of the trustee, mandates payment in full of all section 507 priority claims,
and requires identical treatment for all claims of a particular class.
Subsection (b) permits a chapter 13 plan to (1) divide unsecured claims not entitled to priority under section
507 into classes in the manner authorized for chapter 11 claims; (2) modify the rights of holders of secured
and unsecured claims, except claims wholly secured by real estate mortgages; (3) cure or waive any default;
(4) propose payments on unsecured claims concurrently with payments on any secured claim or any other
class of unsecured claims; (5) provide for curing any default on any secured or unsecured claim on which the
final payment is due after the proposed final payment under the plan; (6) provide for payment of any allowed
postpetition claim; (7) assume or reject any previously unrejected executory contract or unexpired lease of the
debtor; (8) propose the payment of all or any part of any claim from property of the estate or of the debtor; (9)
provide for the vesting of property of the estate; and (10) include any other provision not inconsistent with
other provisions of title 11.
Subsection (c) limits the payment period under the plan to 3 years, except that a 4–year payment period
may be permitted by the court.

§1323. Modification of plan before confirmation
(a) The debtor may modify the plan at any time before confirmation, but may not modify the plan
so that the plan as modified fails to meet the requirements of section 1322 of this title.
(b) After the debtor files a modification under this section, the plan as modified becomes the plan.
(c) Any holder of a secured claim that has accepted or rejected the plan is deemed to have
accepted or rejected, as the case may be, the plan as modified, unless the modification provides for a
change in the rights of such holder from what such rights were under the plan before modification,
and such holder changes such holder's previous acceptance or rejection.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2649.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
The debtor is permitted to modify the plan before confirmation without court approval so long as the
modified plan, which becomes the plan on filing, complies with the requirements of section 1322.
The original acceptance or rejection of a plan by the holder of a secured claim remains binding unless the
modified plan changes the rights of the holder and the holder withdraws or alters its earlier acceptance or
rejection.
§1324. Confirmation hearing
(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) and after notice, the court shall hold a hearing on
confirmation of the plan. A party in interest may object to confirmation of the plan.
(b) The hearing on confirmation of the plan may be held not earlier than 20 days and not later than
45 days after the date of the meeting of creditors under section 341(a), unless the court determines
that it would be in the best interests of the creditors and the estate to hold such hearing at an earlier
date and there is no objection to such earlier date.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Any party in interest may object to the confirmation of a plan, as distinguished from merely rejecting a
plan. An objection to confirmation is predicated on failure of the plan or the procedures employed prior to

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1325(a)(5)(B) of the House amendment modifies the House bill and Senate amendment to
significantly protect secured creditors in chapter 13. Unless the secured creditor accepts the plan, the plan
must provide that the secured creditor retain the lien securing the creditor's allowed secured claim in addition
to receiving value, as of the effective date of the plan of property to be distributed under the plan on account
of the claim not less than the allowed amount of the claim. To this extent, a secured creditor in a case under
chapter 13 is treated identically with a recourse creditor under section 1111(b)(1) of the House amendment
except that the secured creditor in a case under chapter 13 may receive any property of a value as of the
effective date of the plan equal to the allowed amount of the creditor's secured claim rather than being
restricted to receiving deferred cash payments. Of course, the secured creditors' lien only secures the value of
the collateral and to the extent property is distributed of a present value equal to the allowed amount of the
creditor's secured claim the creditor's lien will have been satisfied in full. Thus the lien created under section
1325(a)(5)(B)(i) is effective only to secure deferred payments to the extent of the amount of the allowed
secured claim. To the extent the deferred payments exceed the value of the allowed amount of the secured
claim and the debtor subsequently defaults, the lien will not secure unaccrued interest represented in such
deferred payments.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
The bankruptcy court must confirm a plan if (1) the plan satisfies the provisions of chapter 13 and other
applicable provisions of title 11; (2) it is proposed in good faith; (3) it is in the best interests of creditors, and
defined by subsection (a)(4) of Section 1325; (4) it has been accepted by the holder of each allowed secured
claim provided for the plan or where the holder of any such secured claim is to receive value under the plan
not less than the amount of the allowed secured claim, or where the debtor surrenders to the holder the
collateral securing any such allowed secured claim; (5) the plan is feasible; and (6) the requisite fees and
charges have been paid.
Subsection (b) authorizes the court to order an entity, as defined by Section 101(15), to pay any income of
the debtor to the trustee. Any governmental unit is an entity subject to such an order.

the debtor's prior case pursuant to section 707(b), and some portion of that compensation remains
unpaid in a case converted to this chapter or in the case dismissed under section 707(b) and refiled
under this chapter, the amount of any such unpaid compensation, which shall be paid monthly—

§1327. Effect of confirmation
(a) The provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor, whether or not the claim
of such creditor is provided for by the plan, and whether or not such creditor has objected to, has
accepted, or has rejected the plan.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in the plan or the order confirming the plan, the confirmation of
a plan vests all of the property of the estate in the debtor.
(c) Except as otherwise provided in the plan or in the order confirming the plan, the property
vesting in the debtor under subsection (b) of this section is free and clear of any claim or interest of
any creditor provided for by the plan.
(Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2650.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
Subsection (a) binds the debtor and each creditor to the provisions of a confirmed plan, whether or not the
claim of the creditor is provided for by the plan and whether or not the creditor has accepted, rejected, or
objected to the plan. Unless the plan itself or the order confirming the plan otherwise provides, confirmation is
deemed to vest all property of the estate in the debtor, free and clear of any claim or interest of any creditor
provided for by the plan.
§1328. Discharge
(a) Subject to subsection (d), as soon as practicable after completion by the debtor of all payments
under the plan, and in the case of a debtor who is required by a judicial or administrative order, or by
statute, to pay a domestic support obligation, after such debtor certifies that all amounts payable
under such order or such statute that are due on or before the date of the certification (including
amounts due before the petition was filed, but only to the extent provided for by the plan) have been
paid, unless the court approves a written waiver of discharge executed by the debtor after the order
for relief under this chapter, the court shall grant the debtor a discharge of all debts provided for by
the plan or disallowed under section 502 of this title, except any debt—
(1) provided for under section 1322(b)(5);
(2) of the kind specified in section 507(a)(8)(C) or in paragraph (1)(B), (1)(C), (2), (3), (4), (5),
(8), or (9) of section 523(a);
(3) for restitution, or a criminal fine, included in a sentence on the debtor's conviction of a
crime; or
(4) for restitution, or damages, awarded in a civil action against the debtor as a result of willful
or malicious injury by the debtor that caused personal injury to an individual or the death of an
individual.
(b) Subject to subsection (d), at any time after the confirmation of the plan and after notice and a
hearing, the court may grant a discharge to a debtor that has not completed payments under the plan
[Release Point 118-106]
only if—
(1) the debtor's failure to complete such payments is due to circumstances for which the debtor
should not justly be held accountable;
(2) the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property actually distributed under the plan
on account of each allowed unsecured claim is not less than the amount that would have been paid
on such claim if the estate of the debtor had been liquidated under chapter 7 of this title on such
date; and
(3) modification of the plan under section 1329 of this title is not practicable.
(c) A discharge granted under subsection (b) of this section discharges the debtor from all
unsecured debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under section 502 of this title, except any
debt—
(1) provided for under section 1322(b)(5) of this title; or
(2) of a kind specified in section 523(a) of this title.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a discharge granted under this section
does not discharge the debtor from any debt based on an allowed claim filed under section
1305(a)(2) of this title if prior approval by the trustee of the debtor's incurring such debt was
practicable and was not obtained.
(e) On request of a party in interest before one year after a discharge under this section is granted,
and after notice and a hearing, the court may revoke such discharge only if—
(1) such discharge was obtained by the debtor through fraud; and
(2) the requesting party did not know of such fraud until after such discharge was granted.
(f) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), the court shall not grant a discharge of all debts
provided for in the plan or disallowed under section 502, if the debtor has received a discharge—
(1) in a case filed under chapter 7, 11, or 12 of this title during the 4-year period preceding the
date of the order for relief under this chapter, or
(2) in a case filed under chapter 13 of this title during the 2-year period preceding the date of
such order.
(g)(1) The court shall not grant a discharge under this section to a debtor unless after filing a
petition the debtor has completed an instructional course concerning personal financial management
described in section 111.
(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to a debtor who is a person described in section
109(h)(4) or who resides in a district for which the United States trustee (or the bankruptcy
administrator, if any) determines that the approved instructional courses are not adequate to service
the additional individuals who would otherwise be required to complete such instructional course by
reason of the requirements of paragraph (1).
(3) The United States trustee (or the bankruptcy administrator, if any) who makes a determination
described in paragraph (2) shall review such determination not later than 1 year after the date of such
determination, and not less frequently than annually thereafter.
(h) The court may not grant a discharge under this chapter unless the court after notice and a
hearing held not more than 10 days before the date of the entry of the order granting the discharge
finds that there is no reasonable cause to believe that—
(1) section 522(q)(1) may be applicable to the debtor; and
(2) there is pending any proceeding in which the debtor may be found guilty of a felony of the
kind described in section 522(q)(1)(A) or liable for a debt of the kind described in section
522(q)(1)(B).

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1328(a) adopts a provision contained in the Senate amendment permitting the court to approve a
waiver of discharge by the debtor. It is anticipated that such a waiver must be in writing executed after the
order for relief in a case under chapter 13.
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
The court is to enter a discharge, unless waived, as soon as practicable after completion of payments under
the plan. The debtor is to be discharged of all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under section 502,
except a debt provided for under the plan the last payment on which was not due until after the completion of
the plan, or a debt incurred for willful and malicious conversion of or injury to the property or person of
another.
Subsection (b) is the successor to Bankruptcy Act Section 661 [section 1061 of former title 11]. This
subsection permits the bankruptcy judge to grant the debtor a discharge at any time after confirmation of a
plan, if the court determines, after notice and hearing, that the failure to complete payments under the plan is
due to circumstances for which the debtor should not justly be held accountable, the distributions made to
each creditor under the plan equal in value the amount that would have been paid to the creditor had the estate
been liquidated under chapter 7 of title 11 at the date of the hearing under this subsection, and that
modification of the plan is impracticable. The discharge granted under subsection (b) relieves the debtor from
all unsecured debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under section 502, except nondischargeable debts
described in section 523(a) of title 11 or debts of the type covered by section 1322(b)(5).
Subsection (d) excepts from any chapter 13 discharge a debt based on an allowed section 1305(a)(2)
postpetition claim, if prior trustee approval of the incurring of the debt was practicable but was not obtained.
A chapter 13 discharge obtained through fraud and before the moving party gained knowledge of the fraud
may be revoked by the court under subsection (e), after notice and hearing, at the request of any party in
interest made within 1 year after the discharge was granted.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
LEGISLATIVE STATEMENTS
Section 1331 of the House bill and Senate amendment is deleted in the House amendment.
Special tax provision: Section 1331 of title 11 of the House bill and the comparable provisions in sections
1322 and 1327(d) of the Senate amendment, pertaining to assessment and collection of taxes in wage earner
plans, are deleted, and the governing rule is placed in section 505(c) of the House amendment. The provisions
of both bills allowing assessment and collection of taxes after confirmation of the wage-earner plan are
[Release Point 118-106]
modified to allow assessment and collection after the court fixes the fact and amount of a tax liability,
including administrative period taxes, regardless of whether this occurs before or after confirmation of the
plan. The provision of the House bill limiting the collection of taxes to those assessed before one year after the
filing of the petition is eliminated, thereby leaving the period of limitations on assessment of these
nondischargeable tax liabilities the usual period provided by the Internal Revenue Code [Title 26].
SENATE REPORT NO. 95–989
The court may revoke an order of confirmation procured by fraud, after notice and hearing, on application
of a party in interest filed within 180 days after the entry of the order. Thereafter, unless a modified plan is
confirmed, the court is to convert or dismiss the chapter 13 case as provided in section 1307.
