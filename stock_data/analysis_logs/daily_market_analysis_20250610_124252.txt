News channel activity is also low, suggesting limited information flow and awareness.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) coupled with negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates stagflation. The unemployment rate (3.2%) is below the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), suggesting a tight labor market that could further fuel inflation. Market confidence is low at 35%.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish due to stagflationary conditions. High inflation and negative GDP growth create a challenging environment for corporate earnings and investment. Low market confidence further exacerbates the negative sentiment. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth. volatility is high (1.10) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. market_sentiment is set to 0.35, mirroring the low market confidence. momentum is slightly positive (0.25) due to the low unemployment rate, but is dampened by the negative GDP growth. long_term_outlook is slightly reduced to 0.407 to reflect the overall negative economic outlook."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector outlook is cautiously positive due to persistent inflation and potential supply constraints, but faces headwinds from a slowing economy.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector faces a negative outlook as consumer spending is likely to decrease in a recessionary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector outlook is negative due to concerns about loan defaults and reduced investment activity in a slowing economy.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector is relatively stable, but faces pressure from rising costs and potential government regulation.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector faces a negative outlook due to decreased demand and supply chain disruptions.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector faces a negative outlook as consumer spending decreases due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector faces a mixed outlook. Some companies may benefit from increased demand for cloud computing and cybersecurity, while others may struggle due to decreased consumer spending on discretionary items.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector faces a negative outlook due to decreased demand for goods and services in a slowing economy."
