matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties, for an order directing that such
arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement. Five days' notice in writing of
[Release Point 118-106]

manner provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court shall hear the parties, and upon

not in issue, the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance
with the terms of the agreement. The hearing and proceedings, under such agreement, shall be within

admiralty, on or before the return day of the notice of application, demand a jury trial of such issue,
and upon such demand the court shall make an order referring the issue or issues to a jury in the
manner provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or may specially call a jury for that
purpose. If the jury find that no agreement in writing for arbitration was made or that there is no
default in proceeding thereunder, the proceeding shall be dismissed. If the jury find that an
agreement for arbitration was made in writing and that there is a default in proceeding thereunder,
the court shall make an order summarily directing the parties to proceed with the arbitration in
accordance with the terms thereof.

§202. Agreement or award falling under the Convention
An arbitration agreement or arbitral award arising out of a legal relationship, whether contractual
or not, which is considered as commercial, including a transaction, contract, or agreement described
in section 2 of this title, falls under the Convention. An agreement or award arising out of such a

enforcement abroad, or has some other reasonable relation with one or more foreign states. For the

principal place of business in the United States.

Sec.
401. Definitions.

has not yet arisen at the time of the making of the agreement.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, at the election of the person
