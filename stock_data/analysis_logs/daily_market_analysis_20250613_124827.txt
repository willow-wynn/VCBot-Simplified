  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political and economic discussions, with a high volume of messages in Congress and Public Square. This suggests heightened awareness of policy impacts on the market. The limited news discussion indicates a focus on current events rather than forward-looking analysis.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Low unemployment is a positive, but the market confidence is very low. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major concern.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment and low market confidence, a bearish outlook is warranted. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors that are less sensitive to economic cycles (e.g., healthcare, consumer staples) may outperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment reflects the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly negative due to the weak economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment may decrease in a recessionary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Banks face increased risk from potential loan defaults and a slowing economy.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant as demand remains relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing is highly sensitive to economic cycles and will likely suffer from reduced demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer staples may hold up better, but overall retail sales are expected to decline.",
    "TECH": "Negative. Tech companies are vulnerable to reduced business investment and consumer spending.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation may see reduced demand due to decreased economic activity, but some segments (e.g., essential goods transport) may remain stable."
