    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political and economic uncertainty. The 'Public Square' channel reflects general anxiety, while 'Executive' and 'Congress' channels highlight legislative activity, suggesting potential policy shifts. This contributes to market volatility and reduced confidence.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a mixed picture. High inflation and negative GDP growth indicate stagflation. Low unemployment offers some support, but the deviation from the Fed's inflation target is a major concern. This environment warrants a cautious market outlook.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord sentiment, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Investors are expected to be risk-averse, favoring defensive sectors.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation. Market sentiment is low, reflecting poor confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to low unemployment. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect current economic concerns."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and supply chain issues support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decrease due to inflation. NFLX and DIS face headwinds.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face uncertainty due to potential interest rate hikes and economic slowdown. JPM, BAC, V, and GS are vulnerable.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Healthcare is a defensive sector, and demand remains stable regardless of economic conditions. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are expected to outperform.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral to Negative. Manufacturing faces challenges due to supply chain disruptions and decreased demand. CAT and GE are at risk.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Retailers face decreased consumer spending and increased costs. WMT, COST, and HD are expected to underperform.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies face valuation concerns and potential regulatory scrutiny. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are vulnerable.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Transportation is affected by supply chain issues and decreased economic activity. BA faces headwinds."
