    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress, suggesting policy changes are being actively discussed. Public Square activity is moderate, indicating some general market discussion. Executive activity is low, suggesting limited immediate action from the 'President'. News volume is moderate, with a focus on political news. Overall, Discord activity suggests a focus on policy and less on immediate market reactions.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) is a major concern. GDP growth is negative (-1.2%), indicating a recession. Unemployment is low (3.2%), but this could be a lagging indicator. Market confidence is very low (35%), reflecting the economic uncertainty. The high inflation and negative GDP growth are the primary drivers of the negative outlook.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to high inflation, negative GDP growth, and low market confidence. Increased volatility is expected. Sectors sensitive to economic downturns (e.g., Finance, Manufacturing) will likely underperform, while defensive sectors (e.g., Healthcare, Consumer Staples) may offer some relative protection. Energy may benefit from inflation.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction: Set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic momentum. volatility: Increased to 1.10 to reflect the high inflation rate significantly deviating from the target. market_sentiment: Aligned with the low market confidence at 0.35. momentum: Reduced to 0.25 to reflect the slowing economic growth. long_term_outlook: Slightly reduced to 0.41 to reflect the current economic headwinds."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive: Benefiting from inflationary pressures and potential supply constraints.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative: Consumer spending on discretionary items may decrease due to economic concerns.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative: Sensitive to interest rate hikes and potential loan defaults in a recessionary environment.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive: Defensive sector, less sensitive to economic downturns. Demand for healthcare remains relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative: Susceptible to decreased demand due to economic slowdown and potential supply chain disruptions.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral: Consumer staples may hold up better than discretionary retail, but overall spending is likely to be impacted.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative: Some tech companies may be impacted by decreased business investment and consumer spending.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative: Reduced economic activity will lead to lower demand for transportation services."
