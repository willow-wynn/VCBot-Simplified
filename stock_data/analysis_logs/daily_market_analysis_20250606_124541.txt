  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress and Executive branches, indicating focus on legislative and policy actions. The mention of 'campaigns in North Dakota' suggests political maneuvering. The veto of 'The American Symbols Act' signals potential policy conflicts. This mixed activity contributes to market uncertainty.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) coupled with negative GDP growth (-1.2%) signals stagflation. Unemployment (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low at 35%.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment and low market confidence, a bearish market outlook is warranted. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic downturns (e.g., consumer discretionary) are likely to underperform, while defensive sectors (e.g., healthcare, energy) may offer some resilience.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend Direction: Set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic downturn. Volatility: Increased to 1.10 due to high inflation and market uncertainty. Market Sentiment: Aligned with the low market confidence at 0.35. Momentum: Reduced to 0.20 to reflect the slowing economic momentum. Long-Term Outlook: Slightly reduced to 0.35, reflecting the increased uncertainty about future economic prospects."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decline in a recessionary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative outlook. Banks face increased risk of loan defaults and reduced lending activity.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive outlook. Healthcare is a defensive sector and less sensitive to economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral outlook. Manufacturing activity may slow down due to reduced demand, but infrastructure spending could provide some support.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative outlook. Consumer spending is likely to decline, especially for non-essential goods.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative outlook. Tech companies face reduced corporate spending and potential regulatory headwinds.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral outlook. Transportation activity may decline due to reduced trade and consumer spending, but infrastructure projects could provide some support."
