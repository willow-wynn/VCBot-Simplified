  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress, suggesting focus on policy and potential market-moving legislation. Public Square chatter indicates some concern but also engagement with political figures. News velocity is moderate, with focus on political news. This suggests a slightly negative impact on market sentiment due to uncertainty.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) coupled with negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates stagflation. Unemployment is low (3.2%) but approaching the natural rate (3.5-4.0%). This environment creates uncertainty and downward pressure on the market.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation erodes consumer spending and business investment, while negative GDP growth signals economic contraction. Market confidence is low (35%), reflecting this pessimism. Expect continued volatility and a downward trend in the short term. Long-term outlook is cautiously optimistic, assuming eventual policy adjustments.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (1.15) due to inflation significantly deviating from the target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to align with market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive (0.25) to reflect low unemployment. Long-term outlook is slightly decreased (0.41) to account for current economic headwinds."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints due to geopolitical factors support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending may decrease due to inflation, impacting entertainment spending.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and potential recessionary pressures negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, providing some stability.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Decreased demand due to economic slowdown and higher input costs due to inflation will hurt manufacturing.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Inflation erodes consumer purchasing power, leading to decreased retail sales.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies may face reduced growth due to economic slowdown and higher interest rates.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Mixed outlook. Lower consumer spending could decrease demand, but infrastructure spending could provide some support."
