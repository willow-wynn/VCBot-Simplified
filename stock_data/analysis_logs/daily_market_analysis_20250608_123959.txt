    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth suggests stagflation. Low unemployment is a positive, but the market confidence is very low. The Fed's inability to control inflation is a major concern.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic data and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish in the short term. High volatility is expected due to inflation concerns. The negative GDP growth and low market confidence will likely drive a downward trend. Long-term outlook is slightly pessimistic due to the current economic challenges.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, matching the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to the low unemployment rate, but is dampened by the negative GDP growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic uncertainty."
