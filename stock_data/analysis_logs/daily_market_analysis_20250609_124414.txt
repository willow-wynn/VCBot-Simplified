  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "High message volume in Congress suggests active debate but doesn't necessarily translate to clear market direction. Public Square activity indicates general sentiment, leaning slightly negative due to economic concerns. Executive office communications are minimal, not providing significant market cues. News mentions of political campaigns can introduce uncertainty.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth (stagflation) creates a challenging environment for businesses and consumers. Low unemployment is a bright spot, but its impact is overshadowed by inflationary pressures. Market confidence is low, reflecting the economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Investors are likely to remain risk-averse until there are clear signs of economic recovery. Sectors sensitive to consumer spending may underperform. Defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples may offer some protection.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, reflecting the poor market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to low unemployment, but is outweighed by negative GDP. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic headwinds."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment may decline due to inflation.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face uncertainty due to potential interest rate hikes and a slowing economy.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Healthcare is a defensive sector and tends to perform well during economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing may be impacted by slowing economic growth and supply chain disruptions.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending may shift towards essential goods, impacting discretionary retail.",
    "TECH": "Neutral. Tech companies with strong balance sheets and recurring revenue streams may outperform.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Transportation may be affected by slowing economic activity and higher fuel costs."
