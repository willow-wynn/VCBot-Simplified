Momentum is slightly positive due to low unemployment. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect economic uncertainty."

    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is a defensive sector and may perform relatively well during economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Manufacturing faces mixed signals: potential infrastructure spending vs. economic slowdown.",

    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech sector faces mixed signals: some growth potential vs. higher interest rates and economic uncertainty.",
