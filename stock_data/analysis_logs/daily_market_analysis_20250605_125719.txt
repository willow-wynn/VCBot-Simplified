    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political and congressional matters, suggesting potential policy shifts and uncertainty. The presence of political ads indicates upcoming elections or policy debates that could influence market sentiment. The limited activity in other sectors suggests less immediate concern or focus on those areas.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target (2.0%), indicating persistent price pressures. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) signals a potential recession. The unemployment rate (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), suggesting some labor market weakness. Market confidence is low (35%), reflecting the overall economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth are likely to weigh on corporate earnings and consumer spending. Political uncertainty and policy debates could further dampen investor sentiment. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic momentum. Volatility is high (1.10) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence (0.35). Momentum is slightly positive (0.20) to account for some underlying economic activity. Long-term outlook is slightly adjusted downward (0.36) to reflect the increased uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector outlook is cautiously optimistic due to continued demand, but faces potential headwinds from government regulations and price volatility. XOM, CVX, and COP will likely see moderate gains.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector faces headwinds due to economic slowdown and changing consumer habits. NFLX and DIS may experience downward pressure.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector is vulnerable to interest rate hikes and economic slowdown. JPM, BAC, V, and GS face increased risk.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector is relatively stable but faces challenges from rising costs and regulatory uncertainty. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are expected to be defensive plays.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is facing challenges from supply chain disruptions and slowing global demand. CAT and GE may experience downward pressure.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector is sensitive to consumer spending and inflation. WMT, COST, and HD face increased competition and margin pressure.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector is facing increased scrutiny and potential regulation. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are expected to be volatile.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector is facing challenges from rising fuel costs and economic slowdown. BA may experience downward pressure due to economic uncertainty."
