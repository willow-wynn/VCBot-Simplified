    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress, suggesting potential policy shifts impacting various sectors. Public Square activity indicates some concern, but also active discussion. Executive activity is low, suggesting stability at the top. News volume is moderate, indicating a steady flow of information but no major shocks.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Low market confidence and high unemployment (relative to the natural rate) further exacerbate the situation. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a key concern.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to stagflation fears. High volatility is expected. Sectors that are defensive or benefit from inflation (e.g., Energy, Healthcare) may outperform, while those sensitive to economic growth (e.g., Finance, Consumer Discretionary) may underperform. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, assuming eventual policy adjustments.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative to reflect the GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation. Market sentiment is low, mirroring the confidence indicator. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting the still-low unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to account for the current economic headwinds."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive: Benefiting from high inflation and potential supply constraints.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative: Consumer spending on discretionary items may decrease.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative: Sensitive to economic downturns and interest rate hikes.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive: Defensive sector, less affected by economic cycles.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral: Mixed outlook, dependent on specific industries and export demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative: Consumer spending may decline due to inflation.",
    "TECH": "Neutral: Some segments may be affected by reduced business investment, while others remain resilient.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral: Dependent on overall economic activity and trade flows."
