This indicates a market sensitive to political and regulatory developments.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth signals stagflation. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low, reflecting the uncertainty. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major concern.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to stagflationary pressures. High volatility is expected. Sectors sensitive to interest rates and consumer spending will likely underperform. Energy may see some support due to inflation. Long-term outlook remains uncertain, dependent on the Fed's actions and potential fiscal policy changes.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high, reflecting inflation. Market sentiment aligns with low confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting some employment strength, but overall negative. Long-term outlook is slightly lowered due to the current economic climate."

    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is negatively impacted by slowing economic growth and supply chain disruptions. Expect reduced demand and margin pressure.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector faces significant challenges due to reduced consumer spending and high inflation. Expect increased competition and pressure on margins.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector is mixed. Some segments, like cloud computing, remain resilient, while others face headwinds from reduced business investment and consumer spending. Expect volatility.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector is negatively impacted by slowing economic growth and high fuel costs. Expect reduced demand and pressure on profitability."
