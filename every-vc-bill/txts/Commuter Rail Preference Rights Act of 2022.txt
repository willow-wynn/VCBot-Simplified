A BILL
To allow the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to bring civil
actions in Federal district courts to enforce the right to set preference
over freight transportation under respective titles of the United
States Code
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in
Congress Assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the “Commuter Rail Preference Rights Act of 2022”.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:
(1) The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or Amtrak, was established
under the Public Service Act of 1970;
(2) In May of 1971, Amtrak began service and took over most of the intercity
passenger trains that private and freight railroads were required to operate.
In assuming these operations, Amtrak was given access to the national
railroad network.
(3) Congress passed the Amtrak Improvement Act of 1973 which gave intercity
and commuter rail transportation preference over freight transportation in
using a rail line, junction, or crossing. This right is now codified as section
24308(c) of title 49, United States Code.
(4) Many railways ignored the law (referred to in paragraph (3)) by denying
passenger rail the priority to which it is statutorily authorized and giving
freight transportation the higher priority. As a result, Amtrak’s on-time
performance on most host railroads is poor.
(5) As a result of the violations of Amtrak’s right to preference, Amtrak has been
consistently unable to meet its mandated mission and goals, which are
codified in section 24101 of title 49, United States Code, which relates to
providing on-time and trip-time competitive service to its passengers.
SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR AMTRAK TO BRING CIVIL ACTION
BASED ON PREFERENCE RIGHTS.
(a) IN GENERAL.— Section 24308(c) of title 49, United States Code, is amended

miscellaneous relief in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia to enforce the preference rights granted under this subsection.”.
(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.— Section 24103 of title 49, United States
Code, is amended by adding the following before “, only the Attorney
General”: “and section 24308(c)”.
