# Integration instructions for bot.py
INTEGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS = """
To integrate the stock market system with bot.py, add these lines:

1. At the top of bot.py, add:
   import stock_integration

2. In the on_ready() function, add:
   await stock_integration.setup_stock_market(client)

3. After creating the command tree, add:
   stock_integration.add_stock_commands_to_tree(tree)

4. Make sure matplotlib is installed:
   pip install matplotlib

The stock market system will then be fully integrated with:
- 9 Discord commands for stock management
- Automated daily market analysis at 8:40 AM ET
- Hourly price updates during trading hours (9 AM - 5 PM ET)
- AI-powered market parameter setting
- Integration with economic system data
- Matplotlib chart generation for price movements
