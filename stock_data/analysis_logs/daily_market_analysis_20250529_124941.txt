The PUBLIC_SQUARE channel also has significant activity, suggesting broad engagement. The negative sentiment expressed in some messages, such as 'enviroment screwed me up' and 'RETCONNED, because no', contributes to a cautious market outlook.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a challenging environment. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target (2.0%), leading to increased volatility. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) and a low market confidence (35%) further dampen the outlook. Unemployment (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), adding to economic concerns.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely pressure stock prices. Market confidence is low, and the negative sentiment expressed in Discord channels suggests further downside risk. Expect increased volatility and a cautious approach from investors.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction is set to -0.25 to reflect the negative GDP growth and economic momentum. volatility is set to 0.95 to reflect the high inflation rate. market_sentiment is set to 0.35 to align with the low market confidence. momentum is set to 0.20 to reflect the weak economic growth momentum. long_term_outlook is adjusted slightly to 0.36 to account for potential future improvements."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to high inflation and potential supply constraints. Expect increased demand and higher prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook due to economic uncertainty and reduced consumer spending. Expect lower revenues and potential layoffs.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral outlook. Banks may benefit from higher interest rates, but face risks from potential loan defaults due to economic slowdown.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive outlook. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, and demand remains stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook due to economic slowdown and reduced business investment. Expect lower production and potential job losses.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative outlook. Essential retailers may perform relatively well, but discretionary spending will likely decline.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative outlook. Some tech companies may benefit from increased remote work, but overall growth will likely slow down.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative outlook due to reduced economic activity and lower demand for transportation services."
