    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to stagflation concerns. High volatility is expected. Sectors sensitive to consumer spending (Entertainment, Retail) will likely underperform. Energy may see some support due to inflation. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, assuming policy adjustments.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative to reflect GDP decline. Volatility is high due to inflation. Market sentiment mirrors low confidence. Momentum is reduced to reflect economic slowdown. Long-term outlook is slightly adjusted downwards but remains positive, anticipating eventual recovery."

    "ENERGY": "Energy sector is expected to perform relatively well due to inflationary pressures and potential supply constraints. Expect continued volatility but overall positive trend.",

    "FINANCE": "Financial sector is vulnerable to economic slowdown and potential interest rate hikes. Expect underperformance and increased risk aversion.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector is relatively stable but faces pressure from potential policy changes and cost containment measures. Expect moderate performance.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is sensitive to economic cycles and global trade conditions. Expect underperformance due to GDP decline and potential supply chain disruptions.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector faces challenges from reduced consumer spending and inflationary pressures. Expect underperformance and increased competition.",
    "TECH": "Technology sector is mixed. Some segments (e.g., cloud computing) may remain resilient, while others (e.g., consumer electronics) may face headwinds. Expect moderate performance with high volatility.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector is sensitive to economic activity and energy prices. Expect underperformance due to GDP decline and inflationary pressures."
