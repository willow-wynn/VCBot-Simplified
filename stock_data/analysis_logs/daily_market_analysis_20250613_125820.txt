    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political and economic discussions, with limited direct stock mentions. The high volume of messages in Congress suggests policy uncertainty. Public Square chatter indicates some frustration, potentially reflecting market sentiment. Overall, Discord activity points to a cautious market.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Low market confidence and high unemployment further exacerbate the situation. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major concern.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment and low market confidence, a bearish outlook is warranted. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles, such as finance and consumer discretionary, are particularly vulnerable.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment aligns with low market confidence. Momentum is slightly negative, reflecting economic stagnation. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect increased economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment is likely to decrease in a recessionary environment. DIS and NFLX face headwinds.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Banks face increased risk of loan defaults and reduced lending activity due to the economic slowdown. JPM and BAC are vulnerable.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant. JNJ, PFE, and UNH should maintain relatively stable performance.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Slightly Negative. Manufacturing is sensitive to economic cycles. CAT and GE may experience reduced demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decline. WMT, COST, and HD face challenges.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Slightly Negative. Tech companies are sensitive to interest rates and overall economic growth. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA may experience some pressure.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Government contracts provide stability. LMT should remain relatively stable."
