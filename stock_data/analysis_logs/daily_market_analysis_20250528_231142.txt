    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector faces headwinds from supply chain disruptions and reduced consumer spending. Industrial companies may experience lower profits.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector is highly sensitive to economic conditions. Discretionary spending is likely to decline, impacting retailers of non-essential goods.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector faces mixed prospects. Software and cloud services may remain resilient, but hardware and consumer electronics may suffer from reduced demand.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector is affected by both energy prices and overall economic activity. Airlines and shipping companies may face increased costs and reduced volumes."
