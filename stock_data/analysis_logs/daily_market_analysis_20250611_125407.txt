    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows limited discussion in Congress and States channels, suggesting legislative gridlock and lack of state-level economic initiatives. The Executive channel is active, but the content appears performative rather than substantive. The Public Square shows some user skepticism. Overall, Discord activity does not provide a strong positive or negative signal, but leans slightly negative due to the lack of constructive dialogue.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target (2.0%), necessitating aggressive monetary policy. GDP growth is negative (-1.2%), indicating a recession. Unemployment is low (3.2%), but this could be a lagging indicator. Market confidence is very low (35%). The economy is in a stagflationary environment.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to further declines in stock prices. Sectors sensitive to interest rates and consumer spending will be particularly vulnerable. Energy may be an exception due to supply constraints. Defensive stocks may outperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction: Set to -0.30 to reflect negative GDP growth and economic momentum. volatility: Increased to 1.10 to reflect high inflation. market_sentiment: Aligned with the low market confidence at 0.35. momentum: Reduced to 0.25 due to slowing economic growth. long_term_outlook: Slightly decreased to 0.41 to reflect increased uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and supply constraints will likely keep energy prices elevated.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment will likely decline in a recession.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and a slowing economy will negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces regulatory risks.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing is sensitive to economic cycles and will likely decline in a recession.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending will decline in a recession, impacting retail sales.",
    "TECH": "Negative. Tech companies are sensitive to interest rates and economic growth.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation is mixed, with some segments benefiting from energy prices and others suffering from decreased demand."
