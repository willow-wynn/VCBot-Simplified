AN ACT
to amend sections 1 and 6 of the Parental Leave
Act, passed by Congress on December 13, 2019.
ABSTRACT
The act amends a previous law passed to guarantee
paid parental leave to parents of a newborn child.
The amendment is proposing extending mandated
paid parental leave.
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the “Parental Leave
Extension Act”.
SECTION 2. EXTENSION OF PAID PARENTAL
LEAVE FOR TENURED EMPLOYEES
Under section one of the Parental Leave Act,
employees with at least a year tenure with their
current employer are eligible for 16 weeks of paid

parental leave guaranteed by the federal
government. Under the Parental Leave Extension
Act, a new standard of 20 weeks of paid parental
leave will be guaranteed to tenured employees.
SECTION 3. EXTENSION OF PAID PARENTAL
LEAVE FOR NON TENURED EMPLOYEES
Under section 6 of the Parental Leave Act,
employees with less than a year tenure with a
company are eligible for 12 weeks of paid parental

18 weeks of paid parental leave will be guaranteed
to non tenured employees.
SECTION 4. SMALL BUSINESS TAX EXEMPTION
Employers with less than 100 employees may write
off wages and benefits of employees who utilize
parental leave for the entire length of parental leave
offered. An equal tax credit can be received for all
wages and benefits for 20 weeks. However, if more
than the minimum amount is offered, the employer
may receive an additional tax credit equal to half of

the employee’s weekly wage and benefit for each
additional week taken.
SECTION 5. ENACTMENT
The law shall go into effect immediately upon
passage.
