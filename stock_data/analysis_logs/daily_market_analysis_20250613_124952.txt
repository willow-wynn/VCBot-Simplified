    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and economic uncertainty can negatively impact the financial sector. Expect increased volatility and potential downward pressure on stock prices.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector. Demand for healthcare services remains relatively stable regardless of economic conditions.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Economic slowdown and potential decrease in capital expenditures will negatively impact the manufacturing sector. Expect downward pressure on stock prices.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. High inflation and potential recession will likely decrease consumer spending, negatively impacting the retail sector. Expect increased volatility and potential downward pressure on stock prices.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies are sensitive to economic conditions. High inflation and rising interest rates may negatively impact growth stocks. Expect increased volatility.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. The transport sector is mixed. While consumer spending may decrease, supply chain issues could keep prices high."
