  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in political and congressional discussions, indicating awareness of policy impacts on the market. The presence of political ads suggests potential volatility related to policy changes. Executive and court activity, while low in volume, can have significant impacts if related to market regulation.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth suggests stagflation. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low, reflecting the uncertainty. The high inflation is the primary driver of volatility.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to the combination of high inflation, negative GDP growth, and low market confidence. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles (e.g., manufacturing, finance) are likely to underperform. Defensive sectors (e.g., healthcare, consumer staples) may offer some relative protection.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative to reflect the GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, aligning with the market confidence. Momentum is reduced to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced, acknowledging the current economic challenges but maintaining some optimism for future recovery."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Neutral. High energy prices due to inflation provide some support, but recessionary fears may limit demand.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decrease in a recessionary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Banks are vulnerable to increased loan defaults and reduced investment activity.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Healthcare is a defensive sector and less sensitive to economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing is highly cyclical and will suffer from reduced demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer staples (WMT, COST) may hold up better than discretionary retail.",
    "TECH": "Neutral. Some tech companies are more resilient than others, but overall growth may slow.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Reduced economic activity will lead to lower shipping volumes and travel."
