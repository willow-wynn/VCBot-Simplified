  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a high volume of messages in the Congress channel, indicating active discussion but potentially increased uncertainty. The Public Square channel also shows activity, suggesting broader market interest. The limited activity in the States and Executive channels suggests less focus on regional or executive actions. Overall, the high message volume may contribute to market volatility.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) necessitates a high volatility parameter. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) and an unemployment rate slightly above the natural rate (4.2% vs. 3.5-4.0%) contribute to a negative trend direction. Low market confidence (35%) aligns with a low market sentiment parameter. The economic data suggests a bearish market outlook.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish in the short term. High inflation and negative GDP growth are significant headwinds. While some sectors may perform better than others, overall market sentiment is likely to be negative. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and economic momentum. Volatility is set to 1.10 to reflect the high inflation rate. Market sentiment is set to 0.35 to align with the low market confidence. Momentum is set to 0.20 to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly adjusted to 0.35 to reflect the potential for future recovery, but remains cautious."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform relatively well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending may decline due to inflation, impacting entertainment companies. DIS and NFLX face headwinds.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and economic uncertainty may negatively impact financial institutions. JPM, BAC, V, and GS are expected to underperform.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is generally more resilient during economic downturns. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are expected to maintain relatively stable performance.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Economic slowdown and potential trade disruptions may negatively impact manufacturing companies. CAT, GE, and LMT face challenges.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. High inflation and reduced consumer spending will likely negatively impact retail companies. WMT, COST, and HD are expected to underperform.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies are sensitive to economic cycles. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA face potential headwinds.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Economic slowdown will reduce demand for transportation services. BA faces challenges due to economic uncertainty."
