Sad' comment reflects the economic anxiety, while mentions of 'Fixed' and legislative activity suggest efforts to stabilize the situation. Executive actions are being taken, but the overall sentiment is cautious.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) far exceeds the Fed's target, GDP is contracting (-1.2%), and market confidence is low (35%). Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. These factors suggest a potential recessionary environment.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the negative economic indicators, the market is expected to be bearish in the short term. High volatility is anticipated due to inflation concerns. Sectors like energy and defense might show relative strength, while consumer discretionary and finance could underperform. Overall, a cautious approach is advised.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative (-0.25) to reflect the GDP contraction. Volatility is high (0.95) due to inflation. Market sentiment is low (0.35) aligning with market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive (0.23) due to employment figures. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic (0.37), assuming corrective measures are taken."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector (XOM, CVX, COP) is expected to perform relatively well due to inflation and potential supply constraints. Prices are set with a slightly higher sector factor.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector (DIS, NFLX, EA) faces headwinds due to reduced consumer spending. Prices are set with a lower sector factor, reflecting potential underperformance.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector (JPM, BAC, GS, V, BRK.B) is vulnerable to economic downturns and interest rate hikes. Prices are set with a lower sector factor, indicating potential weakness.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector (JNJ, UNH, PFE) is generally more resilient but still affected by economic conditions. Prices are set with a neutral sector factor.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector (CAT, GE, LMT) faces mixed prospects. Defense (LMT) may benefit from geopolitical tensions, while others are susceptible to economic slowdown. Prices are set with varying sector factors.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector (WMT, COST, HD) is highly sensitive to consumer spending. Discount retailers (WMT, COST) may fare better than home improvement (HD). Prices are set with a slightly lower sector factor.",
    "TECH": "Technology sector (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA) is facing headwinds from slower growth and higher interest rates. Prices are set with a lower sector factor, reflecting potential underperformance.",
    "TRANSPORT": "The transport sector (BA) is expected to be volatile. Prices are set with a neutral sector factor."
