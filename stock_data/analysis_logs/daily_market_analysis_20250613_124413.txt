    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of political discussion and general chatter. The presence of news and executive orders suggests some level of government action being discussed. However, the lack of focused market discussion implies limited direct impact on specific stock valuations. Public Square chatter is mostly jokes and replies, indicating a lack of serious market discussion.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Low unemployment is a positive, but the market confidence is very low. This suggests investors are wary of the current economic climate. The high inflation is the primary driver of market volatility.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment, the market is expected to be bearish in the short term. High inflation will likely lead to continued volatility. Sectors that are less sensitive to economic downturns, such as healthcare and consumer staples, may outperform. Growth stocks are likely to underperform due to the rising interest rate environment.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative (-0.10) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (0.85) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the Fed's target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to align with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly negative (0.45) due to the weak economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced (0.55) to reflect the increased uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Discretionary spending is likely to decrease in a recessionary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Rising interest rates can negatively impact lending and investment activities.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector and less sensitive to economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Infrastructure spending might provide some support, but overall demand could be weak.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Negative. Growth stocks are likely to underperform in a rising interest rate environment.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Mixed outlook due to potential infrastructure bill impact and decreased consumer spending."
