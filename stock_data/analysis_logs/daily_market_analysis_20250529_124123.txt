    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to continued market declines. Investors are likely to remain risk-averse. Expect increased volatility and a flight to safety. Sectors that are less sensitive to economic cycles (e.g., healthcare, consumer staples) may outperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to GDP decline. Volatility is high due to inflation. Market sentiment reflects low confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to employment, but overshadowed by negative GDP. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced due to economic concerns."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Slightly positive due to continued demand and supply constraints, but vulnerable to economic slowdown.",

    "HEALTH": "Neutral to slightly positive as healthcare is generally recession-resistant.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative due to reduced business investment and consumer spending.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative, especially for discretionary items. Consumer staples may hold up better.",
    "TECH": "Mixed. Some areas like cloud computing may remain resilient, but overall growth will be slower.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative due to reduced economic activity and trade."
