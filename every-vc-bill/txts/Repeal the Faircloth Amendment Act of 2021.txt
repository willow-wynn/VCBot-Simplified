A BILL
To repeal the faircloth amendment
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in
Congress Assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the “Repeal the Faircloth Amendment Act”.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress Finds that—
(1) The Faircloth Amendment effectively makes it illegal for the federal government to build or fund
the development of more public housing. Due to this law, the number of public housing units
cannot increase more than the number that existed on October 1, 1999.
(2) The Faircloth Amendment halted the federal government from building hundreds of thousands, if
not millions of new, affordable housing units which ultimately struggling Americans pay the
consequences of an affordable housing shortage.
SEC. 3. REPEAL OF THE FAIRCLOTH AMENDMENT.

2
(a) REPEAL.—Section 9(g) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(g)) is
amended by striking paragraph (3) (relating to limitation on new construction).
SEC. 4. ENACTMENT.
EFFECTIVE DATE.—This Act shall come into effect immediately upon passage.
