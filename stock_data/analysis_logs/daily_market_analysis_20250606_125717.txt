The unemployment rate is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. Low market confidence reflects the overall economic uncertainty.",

Momentum is slightly positive due to stable employment, but tempered by negative GDP. Long-term outlook is slightly decreased to reflect economic concerns."
