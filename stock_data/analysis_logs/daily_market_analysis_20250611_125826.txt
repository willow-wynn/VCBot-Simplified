    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in the Public Square, but the content appears to be low-quality and possibly AI-generated, indicating a lack of genuine market insight from the community. Executive channel activity suggests internal discussions, but limited external impact. Congressional activity is focused on procedural votes, offering little directional guidance for specific sectors. Overall, Discord activity has a neutral to slightly negative impact on market sentiment.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) necessitates a hawkish monetary policy. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) signals a potential recession. Low market confidence (35%) reflects investor unease. While unemployment is low (3.2%), it's approaching the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), limiting further labor market improvement. The overall economic assessment is negative, pointing towards a contractionary environment.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the negative economic indicators and subdued market confidence, the short-term market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely weigh on corporate earnings and investor sentiment. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles, such as Finance and Manufacturing, are expected to underperform. Defensive sectors like Healthcare and Consumer Staples may offer some resilience. Technology, while generally growth-oriented, faces headwinds from higher interest rates and reduced consumer spending. Energy sector is expected to remain relatively stable due to ongoing supply constraints.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction: Set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic contraction. volatility: Set to 0.85 to reflect the high inflation rate and market uncertainty. market_sentiment: Aligned with the low market confidence at 0.35. momentum: Reduced to 0.25 to reflect the slowing economic momentum. long_term_outlook: Slightly reduced to 0.41 to acknowledge the increased risks of a prolonged economic downturn."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector is expected to remain relatively stable due to ongoing supply constraints, but vulnerable to demand destruction from a recession.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector faces headwinds from reduced consumer spending and competition from streaming services.",
    "FINANCE": "Finance sector is expected to underperform due to rising interest rates, potential credit losses, and reduced deal activity.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector is expected to be relatively resilient due to its defensive nature and inelastic demand.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is expected to underperform due to slowing global demand and supply chain disruptions.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector faces headwinds from reduced consumer spending and rising inflation.",
    "TECH": "Technology sector faces headwinds from higher interest rates, reduced consumer spending, and increased regulatory scrutiny.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector is expected to be volatile due to fluctuating fuel prices and uncertain demand."
