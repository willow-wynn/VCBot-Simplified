  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political and campaign-related news. This indicates uncertainty and potential policy shifts, negatively impacting market sentiment. The high volume of messages in the public square suggests widespread discussion and debate, further contributing to volatility. The limited activity in other sectors suggests a lack of focus on core economic drivers.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. The unemployment rate is slightly above the natural rate, suggesting some slack in the labor market. Low market confidence reflects the overall economic uncertainty. The economic assessment is that the market is likely to decline.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to further declines in stock prices. The political uncertainty adds another layer of risk, making investors more cautious. Expect increased volatility and a downward trend in the short term.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, reflecting the poor market confidence. Momentum is reduced to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced due to the current economic conditions."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending may decline in a stagflation environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Higher interest rates and economic uncertainty will negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces cost pressures.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Declining GDP growth will reduce demand for manufactured goods.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decline due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies face headwinds from higher interest rates and slowing economic growth.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Reduced economic activity will decrease demand for transportation services."
