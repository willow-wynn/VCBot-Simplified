  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in political and news channels, suggesting investor focus on macro events rather than individual stock analysis. The low activity in the 'States' channel indicates less focus on localized economic factors. This contributes to the overall negative market sentiment and increased volatility.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. These factors contribute to the negative trend direction and high volatility.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to the prevailing economic conditions. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, assuming corrective measures are taken.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.25 to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is set to 0.90 due to the high inflation rate. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence at 0.35. Momentum is slightly reduced to 0.20 to reflect slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.35 to reflect the current uncertainty."

    "HEALTH": "Neutral outlook as healthcare is generally recession-resistant.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook due to economic slowdown and reduced business investment.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral outlook; discount retailers may outperform, while luxury retail suffers.",
    "TECH": "Negative outlook due to high valuation and potential for reduced growth.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative outlook due to reduced economic activity and potential supply chain disruptions."
