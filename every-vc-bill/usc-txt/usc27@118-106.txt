§204. Permits
(a) Who entitled thereto
The following persons shall, on application therefor, be entitled to a basic permit:
(1) Any person who, on May 25, 1935, held a basic permit as distiller, rectifier, wine producer,
or importer issued by an agency of the Federal Government.
(2) Any other person unless the Secretary of the Treasury finds (A) that such person (or in case
of a corporation, any of its officers, directors, or principal stockholders) has, within five years
prior to the date of application, been convicted of a felony under Federal or State law or has,
within three years prior to date of application, been convicted of a misdemeanor under any Federal
law relating to liquor, including the taxation thereof; or (B) that such person is, by reason of his
business experience, financial standing, or trade connections, not likely to commence operations
within a reasonable period or to maintain such operations in conformity with Federal law; or (C)
that the operations proposed to be conducted by such person are in violation of the law of the State
in which they are to be conducted.
(b) Refusal of permit; hearing
If upon examination of any application for a basic permit the Secretary of the Treasury has reason
to believe that the applicant is not entitled to such permit, he shall notify the applicant thereof and,
upon request by the applicant, afford him due notice and opportunity for hearing on the application.
[Release Point 118-106]
If the Secretary of the Treasury, after affording such notice and opportunity for hearing, finds that
the applicant is not entitled to a basic permit hereunder, he shall by order deny the application stating
the findings which are the basis for his order.
(c) Form of application
The Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe the manner and form of all applications for basic
permits (including the facts to be set forth therein) and the form of all basic permits, and shall specify
in any basic permit the authority conferred by the permit and the conditions thereof in accordance
with the provisions of this subchapter. To the extent deemed necessary by the Secretary of the
Treasury for the efficient administration of this subchapter, separate applications and permits shall be
required by the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to distilled spirits, wine, and malt beverages,
and the various classes thereof, and with respect to the various classes of persons entitled to permits
hereunder. The issuance of a basic permit under this subchapter shall not operate to deprive the
United States of its remedy for any violation of law.
(d) Conditions
A basic permit shall be conditioned upon compliance with the requirements of section 205 of this
title (relating to unfair competition and unlawful practices) and of section 206 of this title (relating to
bulk sales and bottling), with the twenty-first amendment and laws relating to the enforcement
thereof, and with all other Federal laws relating to distilled spirits, wine, and malt beverages,
including taxes with respect thereto.
(e) Revocation, suspension, and annulment
A basic permit shall by order of the Secretary of the Treasury, after due notice and opportunity for
hearing to the permittee, (1) be revoked, or suspended for such period as the Secretary of the
Treasury deems appropriate, if the Secretary finds that the permittee has wilfully violated any of the
conditions thereof, provided that for a first violation of the conditions thereof the permit shall be
subject to suspension only; or (2) be revoked if the Secretary finds that the permittee has not engaged
in the operations authorized by the permit for a period of more than two years; or (3) be annulled if
the Secretary finds that the permit was procured through fraud, or misrepresentation, or concealment
of material fact. The order shall state the findings which are the basis for the order.
(f) Service of orders
Orders of the Secretary with respect to any denial of application, suspension, revocation,
annulment, or other proceedings, shall be served (1) in person by any officer or employee of the
Secretary designated by him or any internal revenue or customs officer authorized by the Secretary
for the purpose, or (2) by mailing the order by registered mail, addressed to the applicant or
respondent at his last known address in the records of the Secretary.
(g) Duration
A basic permit shall continue in effect until suspended, revoked, or annulled as provided herein, or
voluntarily surrendered; except that (1) if leased, sold, or otherwise voluntarily transferred, the
permit shall be automatically terminated thereupon, and (2) if transferred by operation of law or if
actual or legal control of the permittee is acquired, directly or indirectly, whether by stock-ownership
or in any other manner, by any person, then such permit shall be automatically terminated at the
expiration of thirty days thereafter: Provided, That if within such thirty-day period application for a
new basic permit is made by the transferee or permittee, respectively, then the outstanding basic
permit shall continue in effect until such application is finally acted on by the Secretary of the
Treasury.
(h) Appeal; procedure
An appeal may be taken by the permittee or applicant for a permit from any order of the Secretary
of the Treasury denying an application for, or suspending, revoking, or annulling, a basic permit.
Such appeal shall be taken by filing, in the court of appeals of the United States within any circuit
wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, or in the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, within sixty days after the entry of such order, a written
[Release Point 118-106]
petition praying that the order of the Secretary be modified or set aside in whole or in part. A copy of
such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary, or any officer
designated by him for that purpose, and thereupon the Secretary shall file in the court the record
upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the
filing of such petition such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, or set aside such
order, in whole or in part. No objection to the order of the Secretary shall be considered by the court
unless such objection shall have been urged before the Secretary or unless there were reasonable
grounds for failure so to do. The finding of the Secretary as to the facts, if supported by substantial
evidence, shall be conclusive. If any party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional
evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and
that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the
Secretary, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Secretary and to be
adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may
seem proper. The Secretary may modify his findings as to the facts by reason of the additional
evidence so taken, and he shall file with the court such modified or new findings, which, if supported
by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and his recommendation, if any, for the modification or
setting aside of the original order. The judgment and decree of the court affirming, modifying, or
setting aside, in whole or in part, any such order of the Secretary shall be final, subject to review by
the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of
title 28. The commencement of proceedings under this subsection shall, unless specifically ordered
by the court to the contrary, operate as a stay of the Secretary's order.
(i) Limitation
No proceeding for the suspension or revocation of a basic permit for violation of any condition
thereof relating to compliance with Federal law shall be instituted by the Secretary more than
eighteen months after conviction of the violation of Federal law, or, if no conviction has been had,
more than three years after the violation occurred; and no basic permit shall be suspended or revoked
for a violation of any such condition thereof if the alleged violation of Federal law has been
compromised by any officer of the Government authorized to compromise such violation.

any living individual of public prominence, or existing private or public organization, or is a name
that is in simulation or is an abbreviation thereof, and as will prevent the use of a graphic, pictorial,
or emblematic representation of any such individual or organization, if the use of such name or
representation is likely falsely to lead the consumer to believe that the product has been indorsed,
made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in accordance with the
[Release Point 118-106]
specifications of, such individual or organization: Provided, That this clause shall not apply to the
use of the name of any person engaged in business as a distiller, brewer, rectifier, blender, or other
producer, or as an importer, wholesaler, retailer, bottler, or warehouseman, of distilled spirits, wine,
or malt beverages, nor to the use by any person of a trade or brand name used by him or his
predecessor in interest prior to August 29, 1935; including regulations requiring, at time of release

of foreign origin not presently effectively registered in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office which has been used by such person or predecessors in the United States for a period of at
least five years last past, if the use of such name or brand is qualified by the name of the locality in
the United States in which the product is produced, and, in the case of the use of such name or brand
on any label or in any advertisement, if such qualification is as conspicuous as such name or brand.
It shall be unlawful for any person to alter, mutilate, destroy, obliterate, or remove any mark,
brand, or label upon distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages held for sale in interstate or foreign
commerce or after shipment therein, except as authorized by Federal law or except pursuant to
regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury authorizing relabeling for purposes of compliance with
the requirements of this subsection or of State law.
In order to prevent the sale or shipment or other introduction of distilled spirits, wine, or malt
beverages in interstate or foreign commerce, if bottled, packaged, or labeled in violation of the
requirements of this subsection, (1) no bottler of distilled spirits, no producer, blender, or wholesaler
of wine, or proprietor of a bonded wine storeroom, and no brewer or wholesaler of malt beverages
shall bottle, and (2) no person shall remove from customs custody, in bottles, for sale or any other
commercial purpose, distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages, respectively, after such date as the
Secretary of the Treasury fixes as the earliest practicable date for the application of the provisions of
this subsection to any class of such persons (but not later than August 15, 1936, in the case of
distilled spirits, and December 15, 1936, in the case of wine and malt beverages, and only after thirty
days' public notice), unless, upon application to the Secretary of the Treasury, he has obtained and
has in his possession a certificate of label approval covering the distilled spirits, wine, or malt
beverages, issued by the Secretary in such manner and form as he shall by regulations prescribe:
Provided, That any such bottler of distilled spirits, or producer, blender, or wholesaler of wine, or
proprietor of a bonded wine storeroom, or brewer or wholesaler of malt beverages shall be exempt
from the requirements of this subsection if, upon application to the Secretary, he shows to the
satisfaction of the Secretary that the distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages to be bottled by the
applicant are not to be sold, or offered for sale, or shipped or delivered for shipment, or otherwise
introduced, in interstate or foreign commerce. Officers of internal revenue are authorized and
directed to withhold the release of distilled spirits from the bottling plant unless such certificates
have been obtained, or unless the application of the bottler for exemption has been granted by the
Secretary; and customs officers are authorized and directed to withhold the release from customs
custody of distilled spirits, wine, and malt beverages, unless such certificates have been obtained.
The District Courts of the United States, and the United States court for any Territory shall have

upon any application under this subsection; or

advertisement is in, or is calculated to induce sales in, interstate or foreign commerce, or is
disseminated by mail, unless such advertisement is in conformity with such regulations, to be
prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, (1) as will prevent deception of the consumer with
respect to the products advertised and as will prohibit, irrespective of falsity, such statements relating
to age, manufacturing processes, analyses, guaranties, and scientific or irrelevant matters as the
Secretary of the Treasury finds to be likely to mislead the consumer; (2) as will provide the
[Release Point 118-106]
consumer with adequate information as to the identity and quality of the products advertised, the
alcoholic content thereof (except the statements of, or statements likely to be considered as
statements of, alcoholic content of malt beverages and wines are prohibited), and the person
responsible for the advertisement; (3) as will require an accurate statement, in the case of distilled
spirits (other than cordials, liqueurs, and specialties) produced by blending or rectification, if neutral
spirits have been used in the production thereof, informing the consumer of the percentage of neutral
spirits so used and of the name of the commodity from which such neutral spirits have been distilled,
or in case of neutral spirits or of gin produced by a process of continuous distillation, the name of the
commodity from which distilled; (4) as will prohibit statements that are disparaging of a competitor's
products or are false, misleading, obscene, or indecent; (5) as will prevent statements inconsistent
with any statement on the labeling of the products advertised. This subsection shall not apply to
outdoor advertising in place on June 18, 1935, but shall apply upon replacement, restoration, or
renovation of any such advertising. The prohibitions of this subsection and regulations thereunder
shall not apply to the publisher of any newspaper, periodical, or other publication, or radio
broadcaster, unless such publisher or radio broadcaster is engaged in business as a distiller, brewer,

malt beverages outside such State only to the extent that the law of such State imposes similar
requirements with respect to similar transactions between a retailer or trade buyer in such State and a
brewer, importer, or wholesaler of malt beverages in such State, as the case may be. In the case of
malt beverages, the provisions of this subsection and subsection (e) shall apply to the labeling of
malt beverages sold or shipped or delivered for shipment or otherwise introduced into or received in
any State from any place outside thereof, or the advertising of malt beverages intended to be sold or
shipped or delivered for shipment or otherwise introduced into or received in any State from any
place outside thereof, only to the extent that the law of such State imposes similar requirements with
respect to the labeling or advertising, as the case may be, of malt beverages not sold or shipped or

SUBCHAPTER II—ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE LABELING
§213. Declaration of policy and purpose
The Congress finds that the American public should be informed about the health hazards that
may result from the consumption or abuse of alcoholic beverages, and has determined that it would
be beneficial to provide a clear, nonconfusing reminder of such hazards, and that there is a need for
national uniformity in such reminders in order to avoid the promulgation of incorrect or misleading
information and to minimize burdens on interstate commerce. The Congress finds that requiring such
reminders on all containers of alcoholic beverages is appropriate and necessary in view of the
[Release Point 118-106]
substantial role of the Federal Government in promoting the health and safety of the Nation's
population. It is therefore the policy of the Congress, and the purpose of this subchapter, to exercise
the full reach of the Federal Government's constitutional powers in order to establish a
comprehensive Federal program, in connection with the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages
in or affecting interstate commerce, to deal with the provision of warning or other information with
respect to any relationship between the consumption or abuse of alcoholic beverages and health, so
that—
(1) the public may be adequately reminded about any health hazards that may be associated
with the consumption or abuse of alcoholic beverages through a nationally uniform, nonconfusing
warning notice on each container of such beverages; and
(2) commerce and the national economy may be—
(A) protected to the maximum extent consistent with this declared policy,
(B) not impeded by diverse, nonuniform, and confusing requirements for warnings or other
information on alcoholic beverage containers with respect to any relationship between the
consumption or abuse of alcoholic beverages and health, and
(C) protected from the adverse effects that would result from a noncomprehensive program
covering alcoholic beverage containers sold in interstate commerce, but not alcoholic beverage
containers manufactured and sold within a single State.
