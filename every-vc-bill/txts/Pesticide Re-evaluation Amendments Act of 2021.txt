A BILL
To amend the Pesticide Re-Evaluation Act of 2021
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in
Congress Assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the “Pesticide Re-evaluation Amendments Act”.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that:
(1) Chlorpyrifos has been used as a pesticide since 1965 in both agricultural and
non-agricultural industries.
(2) Chlorpyrifos affects the nervous system of people, pets, and other animals the
same way it affects the targeted pests.
(3) Chlorpyrifos is acutely toxic and associated with neurodevelopmental harms
in children. Exposures to chlorpyrifos are associated with lower birth weight,

reduced IQ rates, loss of working memory, attention disorders, and delayed
motor development.
(4) A growing body of evidence shows that prenatal exposure to very low levels of
chlorpyrifos can still harm children.
(5) The Environmental Protection Agency revised a human health risk
assessment for the pesticide in 2016, stating that there are no safe uses for
the pesticide.
(6) Farmworkers along with people living in agricultural communities,
particularly children, are disproportionately affected by this toxic pesticide.
(7) Chlorpyrifos is used on a wide variety of crops including apples, corn, wheat,
citrus, and other foods families eat daily.
(8) In 2019, the European Union (EU) announced that it will no longer permit
the toxic chemical to be sold.
