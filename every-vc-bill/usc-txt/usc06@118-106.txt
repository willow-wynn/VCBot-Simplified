2021, 86 F.R. 55467, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
and in order to ensure protection of information systems for critical infrastructure, including emergency
preparedness communications and the physical assets that support such systems, in the information age, it is
hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Policy. The information technology revolution has changed the way business is transacted,
government operates, and national defense is conducted. Those three functions now depend on an
interdependent network of critical information infrastructures. It is the policy of the United States to protect
[Release Point 118-106]
against disruption of the operation of information systems for critical infrastructure and thereby help to protect
the people, economy, essential human and government services, and national security of the United States,
and to ensure that any disruptions that occur are infrequent, of minimal duration, and manageable, and cause
the least damage possible. The implementation of this policy shall include a voluntary public-private
partnership, involving corporate and nongovernmental organizations.
SEC. 2. Continuing Authorities. This order does not alter the existing authorities or roles of United States
Government departments and agencies. Authorities set forth in 44 U.S.C. chapter 35, and other applicable law,
provide senior officials with responsibility for the security of Federal Government information systems.
(a) Executive Branch Information Systems Security. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) has the responsibility to develop and oversee the implementation of government-wide policies,
principles, standards, and guidelines for the security of information systems that support the executive branch
departments and agencies, except those noted in section 2(b) of this order. The Director of OMB shall advise
the President and the appropriate department or agency head when there is a critical deficiency in the security
practices within the purview of this section in an executive branch department or agency.
(b) National Security Information Systems. The Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central
Intelligence (DCI) shall have responsibility to oversee, develop, and ensure implementation of policies,
principles, standards, and guidelines for the security of information systems that support the operations under
their respective control. In consultation with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and
the affected departments and agencies, the Secretary of Defense and the DCI shall develop policies, principles,
standards, and guidelines for the security of national security information systems that support the operations
of other executive branch departments and agencies with national security information.
(i) Policies, principles, standards, and guidelines developed under this subsection may require more
stringent protection than those developed in accordance with section 2(a) of this order.
(ii) The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs shall advise the President and the
appropriate department or agency when there is a critical deficiency in the security practices of a
department or agency within the purview of this section.
(iii) National Security Systems. The National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems
Security Committee, as established by and consistent with NSD–42 and chaired by the Department of
Defense, shall be designated as the "Committee on National Security Systems."
(c) Additional Responsibilities. The heads of executive branch departments and agencies are responsible
and accountable for providing and maintaining adequate levels of security for information systems, including
emergency preparedness communications systems, for programs under their control. Heads of such
departments and agencies shall ensure the development and, within available appropriations, funding of
programs that adequately address these mission systems, especially those critical systems that support the
national security and other essential government programs. Additionally, security should enable, and not
unnecessarily impede, department and agency business operations.
SEC. 3. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council
(NIAC), established on October 16, 2001, shall provide the President, through the Secretary of Homeland
Security, with advice on the security and resilience of the critical infrastructure sectors and their functional
systems, physical assets, and cyber networks.
(a) Membership. The NIAC shall be composed of not more than 30 members appointed by the President,
taking appropriate account of the benefits of having members:
(i) from the private sector, including individuals with experience in banking and finance, transportation,
energy, water, communications, health care services, food and agriculture, government facilities, emergency
services organizations, institutions of higher education, environmental and climate resilience, and State, local,
and tribal governments;
(ii) with senior executive leadership responsibilities for the availability and reliability, including security
and resilience, of critical infrastructure sectors;
(iii) with expertise relevant to the functions of the NIAC; and
(iv) with experience equivalent to that of a chief executive of an organization.
Unless otherwise determined by the President, no full-time officer or employee of the executive branch
shall be appointed to serve as a member of the NIAC. The President shall designate from among the members
of the NIAC a Chair and a Vice Chair, who shall perform the functions of the Chair if the Chair is absent or
disabled, or in the instance of a vacancy in the Chair, each for a term of up to two years.. [sic]
(b) Functions of the NIAC. The NIAC shall meet periodically to:
(i) enhance the partnership of the public and private sectors in securing and enhancing the security and
resilience of critical infrastructure and their supporting functional systems, physical assets, and cyber
networks, and provide reports on this issue to the President, through the Secretary of Homeland Security, as
[Release Point 118-106]
appropriate;
(ii) propose and develop ways to encourage private industry to perform periodic risk assessments and
implement risk-reduction programs;
(iii) monitor the development and operations of critical infrastructure sector coordinating councils and their
information-sharing mechanisms and provide recommendations to the President, through the Secretary of
Homeland Security, on how these organizations can best foster improved cooperation among the sectors, the
Department of Homeland Security, and other Federal Government entities;
(iv) report to the President through the Secretary of Homeland Security, who shall ensure appropriate
coordination with the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, the Assistant to
the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs under the
terms of this order; and
(v) advise sector-specific agencies with critical infrastructure responsibilities to include issues pertaining to
sector and government coordinating councils and their information sharing mechanisms.
In implementing this order, the NIAC shall not advise or otherwise act on matters pertaining to National
Security and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) Communications and, with respect to any matters to which the
NIAC is authorized by this order to provide advice or otherwise act on that may depend on or affect NS/EP
Communications, shall coordinate with the National Security and Telecommunications Advisory Committee
established by Executive Order 12382 of September 13, 1982, as amended.
(c) Administration of the NIAC.
(i) The NIAC may hold hearings, conduct inquiries, and establish subcommittees, as appropriate.
(ii) Upon request of the Chair, and to the extent permitted by law, the heads of the executive
departments and agencies shall provide the NIAC with information and advice relating to its functions.
(iii) Senior Federal Government officials may participate in the meetings of the NIAC, as appropriate.
(iv) Members shall serve without compensation for their work on the NIAC. However, members may
be reimbursed for travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for
persons serving intermittently in Federal Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701–5707).
(v) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Department of
Homeland Security shall provide the NIAC with administrative services, staff, and other support services,
and such funds as may be necessary for the performance of the NIAC's functions.
SEC. 4. Judicial Review. This order does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural,
enforceable at law or in equity, against the United States, its departments, agencies, or other entities, its
officers or employees, or any other person.

EX. ORD. NO. 13636. IMPROVING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE CYBERSECURITY
Ex. Ord. No. 13636, Feb. 12, 2013, 78 F.R. 11739, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Policy. Repeated cyber intrusions into critical infrastructure demonstrate the need for
improved cybersecurity. The cyber threat to critical infrastructure continues to grow and represents one of the
most serious national security challenges we must confront. The national and economic security of the United
States depends on the reliable functioning of the Nation's critical infrastructure in the face of such threats. It is
the policy of the United States to enhance the security and resilience of the Nation's critical infrastructure and
to maintain a cyber environment that encourages efficiency, innovation, and economic prosperity while
promoting safety, security, business confidentiality, privacy, and civil liberties. We can achieve these goals
through a partnership with the owners and operators of critical infrastructure to improve cybersecurity
information sharing and collaboratively develop and implement risk-based standards.
SEC. 2. Critical Infrastructure. As used in this order, the term critical infrastructure means systems and
assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such
systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public
health or safety, or any combination of those matters.
SEC. 3. Policy Coordination. Policy coordination, guidance, dispute resolution, and periodic in-progress
reviews for the functions and programs described and assigned herein shall be provided through the
interagency process established in Presidential Policy Directive–1 of February 13, 2009 (Organization of the
National Security Council System), or any successor.
SEC. 4. Cybersecurity Information Sharing. (a) It is the policy of the United States Government to increase
the volume, timeliness, and quality of cyber threat information shared with U.S. private sector entities so that
these entities may better protect and defend themselves against cyber threats. Within 120 days of the date of
this order, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security (the "Secretary"), and the Director of
National Intelligence shall each issue instructions consistent with their authorities and with the requirements
of section 12(c) of this order to ensure the timely production of unclassified reports of cyber threats to the U.S.
homeland that identify a specific targeted entity. The instructions shall address the need to protect intelligence
and law enforcement sources, methods, operations, and investigations.
(b) The Secretary and the Attorney General, in coordination with the Director of National Intelligence, shall
establish a process that rapidly disseminates the reports produced pursuant to section 4(a) of this order to the
targeted entity. Such process shall also, consistent with the need to protect national security information,
include the dissemination of classified reports to critical infrastructure entities authorized to receive them. The
Secretary and the Attorney General, in coordination with the Director of National Intelligence, shall establish
a system for tracking the production, dissemination, and disposition of these reports.
(c) To assist the owners and operators of critical infrastructure in protecting their systems from
unauthorized access, exploitation, or harm, the Secretary, consistent with [former] 6 U.S.C. 143 [now 6 U.S.C.
655] and in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, shall, within 120 days of the date of this order,
establish procedures to expand the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services program to all critical infrastructure
sectors. This voluntary information sharing program will provide classified cyber threat and technical
information from the Government to eligible critical infrastructure companies or commercial service providers
that offer security services to critical infrastructure.
(d) The Secretary, as the Executive Agent for the Classified National Security Information Program created
under Executive Order 13549 of August 18, 2010 (Classified National Security Information Program for State,
Local, Tribal, and Private Sector Entities), shall expedite the processing of security clearances to appropriate
[Release Point 118-106]
personnel employed by critical infrastructure owners and operators, prioritizing the critical infrastructure
identified in section 9 of this order.
(e) In order to maximize the utility of cyber threat information sharing with the private sector, the Secretary
shall expand the use of programs that bring private sector subject-matter experts into Federal service on a
temporary basis. These subject matter experts should provide advice regarding the content, structure, and
types of information most useful to critical infrastructure owners and operators in reducing and mitigating
cyber risks.
SEC. 5. Privacy and Civil Liberties Protections. (a) Agencies shall coordinate their activities under this
order with their senior agency officials for privacy and civil liberties and ensure that privacy and civil liberties
protections are incorporated into such activities. Such protections shall be based upon the Fair Information
Practice Principles and other privacy and civil liberties policies, principles, and frameworks as they apply to
each agency's activities.
(b) The Chief Privacy Officer and the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties of the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) shall assess the privacy and civil liberties risks of the functions and programs
undertaken by DHS as called for in this order and shall recommend to the Secretary ways to minimize or
mitigate such risks, in a publicly available report, to be released within 1 year of the date of this order. Senior
agency privacy and civil liberties officials for other agencies engaged in activities under this order shall
conduct assessments of their agency activities and provide those assessments to DHS for consideration and
inclusion in the report. The report shall be reviewed on an annual basis and revised as necessary. The report
may contain a classified annex if necessary. Assessments shall include evaluation of activities against the Fair
Information Practice Principles and other applicable privacy and civil liberties policies, principles, and
frameworks. Agencies shall consider the assessments and recommendations of the report in implementing
privacy and civil liberties protections for agency activities.
(c) In producing the report required under subsection (b) of this section, the Chief Privacy Officer and the
Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties of DHS shall consult with the Privacy and Civil Liberties
Oversight Board and coordinate with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
(d) Information submitted voluntarily in accordance with [former] 6 U.S.C. 133 [now 6 U.S.C. 673] by
private entities under this order shall be protected from disclosure to the fullest extent permitted by law.
SEC. 6. Consultative Process. The Secretary shall establish a consultative process to coordinate
improvements to the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. As part of the consultative process, the Secretary
shall engage and consider the advice, on matters set forth in this order, of the Critical Infrastructure
Partnership Advisory Council; Sector Coordinating Councils; critical infrastructure owners and operators;
Sector-Specific Agencies; other relevant agencies; independent regulatory agencies; State, local, territorial,
and tribal governments; universities; and outside experts.
SEC. 7. Baseline Framework to Reduce Cyber Risk to Critical Infrastructure. (a) The Secretary of
Commerce shall direct the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (the "Director") to
lead the development of a framework to reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure (the "Cybersecurity
Framework"). The Cybersecurity Framework shall include a set of standards, methodologies, procedures, and
processes that align policy, business, and technological approaches to address cyber risks. The Cybersecurity
Framework shall incorporate voluntary consensus standards and industry best practices to the fullest extent
possible. The Cybersecurity Framework shall be consistent with voluntary international standards when such
international standards will advance the objectives of this order, and shall meet the requirements of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 271 et seq.), the National
Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Public Law 104–113), and OMB Circular A–119, as

requirements related to cybersecurity.
SEC. 9. Identification of Critical Infrastructure at Greatest Risk. (a) Within 150 days of the date of this
order, the Secretary shall use a risk-based approach to identify critical infrastructure where a cybersecurity
incident could reasonably result in catastrophic regional or national effects on public health or safety,
economic security, or national security. In identifying critical infrastructure for this purpose, the Secretary
shall use the consultative process established in section 6 of this order and draw upon the expertise of
Sector-Specific Agencies. The Secretary shall apply consistent, objective criteria in identifying such critical

EX. ORD. NO. 13691. PROMOTING PRIVATE SECTOR CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION
SHARING
Ex. Ord. No. 13691, Feb. 13, 2015, 80 F.R. 9349, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Policy. In order to address cyber threats to public health and safety, national security, and
economic security of the United States, private companies, nonprofit organizations, executive departments and
agencies (agencies), and other entities must be able to share information related to cybersecurity risks and
incidents and collaborate to respond in as close to real time as possible.
Organizations engaged in the sharing of information related to cybersecurity risks and incidents play an
invaluable role in the collective cybersecurity of the United States. The purpose of this order is to encourage
the voluntary formation of such organizations, to establish mechanisms to continually improve the capabilities
and functions of these organizations, and to better allow these organizations to partner with the Federal
Government on a voluntary basis.
Such information sharing must be conducted in a manner that protects the privacy and civil liberties of
individuals, that preserves business confidentiality, that safeguards the information being shared, and that
protects the ability of the Government to detect, investigate, prevent, and respond to cyber threats to the public
health and safety, national security, and economic security of the United States.
This order builds upon the foundation established by Executive Order 13636 of February 12, 2013
(Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity), and Presidential Policy Directive–21 (PPD–21) of February
12, 2013 (Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience).
Policy coordination, guidance, dispute resolution, and periodic in-progress reviews for the functions and
programs described and assigned herein shall be provided through the interagency process established in

interferes with accurate, actionable, and timely information sharing, increases the cost of information
security, and needlessly limits stakeholder and public access to information.

be shared with whom, and negatively affects the dissemination of information within the Federal
Government and with State, local, and tribal entities, and with the private sector.

sharing environment established under section 1016 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention

"(5) Federal departments or agencies authorized to make original classification decisions or that
perform derivative classification of information are responsible for developing, implementing, and
administering policies, procedures, and programs that promote compliance with applicable laws, executive
orders, and other authorities pertaining to the proper use of classification markings and the policies of the

EXECUTIVE DOCUMENTS
EX. ORD. NO. 13865. COORDINATING NATIONAL RESILIENCE TO ELECTROMAGNETIC
PULSES
Ex. Ord. No. 13865, Mar. 26, 2019, 84 F.R. 12041, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Purpose. An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) has the potential to disrupt, degrade, and damage
technology and critical infrastructure systems. Human-made or naturally occurring EMPs can affect large
geographic areas, disrupting elements critical to the Nation's security and economic prosperity, and could
adversely affect global commerce and stability. The Federal Government must foster sustainable, efficient,
and cost-effective approaches to improving the Nation's resilience to the effects of EMPs.
SEC. 2. Definitions. As used in this order:
(a) "Critical infrastructure" means systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United
States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on
security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.
(b) "Electromagnetic pulse" is a burst of electromagnetic energy. EMPs have the potential to negatively
affect technology systems on Earth and in space. A high-altitude EMP (HEMP) is a type of human-made EMP
that occurs when a nuclear device is detonated at approximately 40 kilometers or more above the surface of
Earth. A geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) is a type of natural EMP driven by a temporary disturbance of
Earth's magnetic field resulting from interactions with solar eruptions. Both HEMPs and GMDs can affect
large geographic areas.
(c) "National Critical Functions" means the functions of government and the private sector so vital to the
United States that their disruption, corruption, or dysfunction would have a debilitating effect on security,
national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof.
(d) "National Essential Functions" means the overarching responsibilities of the Federal Government to lead
and sustain the Nation before, during, and in the aftermath of a catastrophic emergency, such as an EMP that
adversely affects the performance of Government.
(e) "Prepare" and "preparedness" mean the actions taken to plan, organize, equip, train, and exercise to
build and sustain the capabilities necessary to prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and
recover from those threats that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation. These terms include the
prediction and notification of impending EMPs.
(f) A "Sector-Specific Agency" (SSA) is the Federal department or agency that is responsible for providing
institutional knowledge and specialized expertise as well as leading, facilitating, or supporting the security and
resilience programs and associated activities of its designated critical infrastructure sector in the all-hazards
environment. The SSAs are those identified in Presidential Policy Directive 21 of February 12, 2013 (Critical
Infrastructure Security and Resilience).
SEC. 3. Policy. (a) It is the policy of the United States to prepare for the effects of EMPs through targeted
[Release Point 118-106]
approaches that coordinate whole-of-government activities and encourage private-sector engagement. The
Federal Government must provide warning of an impending EMP; protect against, respond to, and recover
from the effects of an EMP through public and private engagement, planning, and investment; and prevent
adversarial events through deterrence, defense, and nuclear nonproliferation efforts. To achieve these goals,
the Federal Government shall engage in risk-informed planning, prioritize research and development (R&D)
to address the needs of critical infrastructure stakeholders, and, for adversarial threats, consult Intelligence
Community assessments.
(b) To implement the actions directed in this order, the Federal Government shall promote collaboration and
facilitate information sharing, including the sharing of threat and vulnerability assessments, among executive
departments and agencies (agencies), the owners and operators of critical infrastructure, and other relevant
stakeholders, as appropriate. The Federal Government shall also provide incentives, as appropriate, to
private-sector partners to encourage innovation that strengthens critical infrastructure against the effects of
EMPs through the development and implementation of best practices, regulations, and appropriate guidance.
SEC. 4. Coordination. (a) The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), through
National Security Council staff and in consultation with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology
Policy (OSTP), shall coordinate the development and implementation of executive branch actions to assess,
prioritize, and manage the risks of EMPs. The APNSA shall, on an annual basis, submit a report to the
President summarizing progress on the implementation of this order, identifying gaps in capability, and
recommending how to address those gaps.
(b) To further the Federal R&D necessary to prepare the Nation for the effects of EMPs, the Director of
OSTP shall coordinate efforts of agencies through the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). The
Director of OSTP, through the NSTC, shall annually review and assess the R&D needs of agencies conducting
preparedness activities for EMPs, consistent with this order.

amount of basic pay which would be payable for a year of service by such employee, computed
using the employee's final rate of basic pay, and, if last serving on other than a full-time basis,
with appropriate adjustment therefor.
(e) Effect of subsequent employment with the Government
An individual who receives a voluntary separation incentive payment under this section and who,
within 5 years after the date of the separation on which the payment is based, accepts any
compensated employment with the Government or works for any agency of the Government through
a personal services contract, shall be required to pay, prior to the individual's first day of
employment, the entire amount of the incentive payment. Such payment shall be made to the covered
entity from which the individual separated or, if made on or after the transfer date, to the Deputy
Secretary or the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security (for transfer to the
appropriate component of the Department of Homeland Security, if necessary).
(f) Effect on employment levels
(1) Intended effect
Voluntary separations under this section are not intended to necessarily reduce the total number
of full-time equivalent positions in any covered entity.
(2) Use of voluntary separations
A covered entity may redeploy or use the full-time equivalent positions vacated by voluntary
separations under this section to make other positions available to more critical locations or more
critical occupations.

FINDINGS
Pub. L. 108–330, §2, Oct. 16, 2004, 118 Stat. 1275, provided that: "The Congress finds the following:
"(1) Influential financial management leadership is of vital importance to the mission success of the
Department of Homeland Security. For this reason, the Chief Financial Officer of the Department must be a
key figure in the Department's management.
"(2) To provide a sound financial leadership structure, the provisions of law enacted by the Chief
Financial Officers Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–576) [see Short Title of 1990 Amendment note set out
under section 501 of Title 31, Money and Finance] provide that the Chief Financial Officer of each of the
Federal executive departments is to be a Presidential appointee who reports directly to the Secretary of that
department on financial management matters. Because the Department of Homeland Security was only
recently created, the provisions enacted by that Act must be amended to include the Department within
these provisions.
"(3) The Department of Homeland Security was created by consolidation of 22 separate Federal
agencies, each with its own accounting and financial management system. None of these systems was
developed with a view to executing the mission of the Department of Homeland Security to prevent terrorist
attacks within the United States, reduce the Nation's vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage
and assist in the recovery from terrorist attacks. For these reasons, a strong Chief Financial Officer is
needed within the Department both to consolidate financial management operations, and to insure that
management control systems are comprehensively designed to achieve the mission and execute the strategy
of the Department.
"(4) The provisions of law enacted by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 require agency Chief
Financial Officers to improve the financial information available to agency managers and the Congress.
Those provisions also specify that agency financial management systems must provide for the systematic
measurement of performance. In the case of the Department of Homeland Security, therefore, it is vitally
important that management control systems be designed with a clear view of a homeland security strategy,
including the priorities of the Department in addressing those risks of terrorism deemed most significant
based upon a comprehensive assessment of potential threats, vulnerabilities, criticality, and consequences.
For this reason, Federal law should be amended to clearly state the responsibilities of the Chief Financial
Officer of the Department of Homeland Security to provide management control information, for the
benefit of managers within the Department and to help inform the Congress, that permits an assessment of
the Department's performance in executing a homeland security strategy."

EXECUTIVE DOCUMENTS
EX. ORD. NO. 13629. ESTABLISHING THE WHITE HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY
PARTNERSHIP COUNCIL
Ex. Ord. No. 13629, Oct. 26, 2012, 77 F.R. 66353, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
and in order to advance the Federal Government's use of local partnerships to address homeland security
challenges, it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Policy. The purpose of this order is to maximize the Federal Government's ability to develop
local partnerships in the United States to support homeland security priorities. Partnerships are collaborative
working relationships in which the goals, structure, and roles and responsibilities of the relationships are
mutually determined. Collaboration enables the Federal Government and its partners to use resources more
efficiently, build on one another's expertise, drive innovation, engage in collective action, broaden investments
to achieve shared goals, and improve performance. Partnerships enhance our ability to address homeland
security priorities, from responding to natural disasters to preventing terrorism, by utilizing diverse
perspectives, skills, tools, and resources.
The National Security Strategy emphasizes the importance of partnerships, underscoring that to keep our
Nation safe "we must tap the ingenuity outside government through strategic partnerships with the private
sector, nongovernmental organizations, foundations, and community-based organizations. Such partnerships
are critical to U.S. success at home and abroad, and we will support them through enhanced opportunities for
engagement, coordination, transparency, and information sharing." This approach recognizes that, given the
complexities and range of challenges, we must institutionalize an all-of-Nation effort to address the evolving
threats to the United States.

[Release Point 118-106]
or the "SAFETY Act", see section 861 of Pub. L. 107–296, set out as a Short Title note under section 101 of
this title.
§442. Litigation management
(a) Federal cause of action
(1) In general
There shall exist a Federal cause of action for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting from
an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed in defense
against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the
Seller. The substantive law for decision in any such action shall be derived from the law, including
choice of law principles, of the State in which such acts of terrorism occurred, unless such law is
inconsistent with or preempted by Federal law. Such Federal cause of action shall be brought only
for claims for injuries that are proximately caused by sellers 1 that provide qualified anti-terrorism
technology to Federal and non-Federal government 2 customers.
(2) Jurisdiction
Such appropriate district court of the United States shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction
over all actions for any claim for loss of property, personal injury, or death arising out of, relating
to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been
deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may
result in loss to the Seller.
(b) Special rules
In an action brought under this section for damages the following provisions apply:
(1) Punitive damages
No punitive damages intended to punish or deter, exemplary damages, or other damages not
intended to compensate a plaintiff for actual losses may be awarded, nor shall any party be liable
for interest prior to the judgment.
(2) Noneconomic damages
(A) In general
Noneconomic damages may be awarded against a defendant only in an amount directly
proportional to the percentage of responsibility of such defendant for the harm to the plaintiff,
and no plaintiff may recover noneconomic damages unless the plaintiff suffered physical harm.
(B) Definition
For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "noneconomic damages" means damages for
losses for physical and emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, mental
anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and companionship, loss of
consortium, hedonic damages, injury to reputation, and any other nonpecuniary losses.
(c) Collateral sources
Any recovery by a plaintiff in an action under this section shall be reduced by the amount of
collateral source compensation, if any, that the plaintiff has received or is entitled to receive as a
result of such acts of terrorism that result or may result in loss to the Seller.
(d) Government contractor defense
(1) In general
Should a product liability or other lawsuit be filed for claims arising out of, relating to, or
resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies approved by the
Secretary, as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, have been deployed in defense
against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the
[Release Point 118-106]
Seller, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the government contractor defense applies in
such lawsuit. This presumption shall only be overcome by evidence showing that the Seller acted
fraudulently or with willful misconduct in submitting information to the Secretary during the
course of the Secretary's consideration of such technology under this subsection. This presumption
of the government contractor defense shall apply regardless of whether the claim against the Seller
arises from a sale of the product to Federal Government or non-Federal Government customers.
(2) Exclusive responsibility
The Secretary will be exclusively responsible for the review and approval of anti-terrorism
technology for purposes of establishing a government contractor defense in any product liability
lawsuit for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified
anti-terrorism technologies approved by the Secretary, as provided in this paragraph and paragraph
(3), have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims
result or may result in loss to the Seller. Upon the Seller's submission to the Secretary for approval
of anti-terrorism technology, the Secretary will conduct a comprehensive review of the design of
such technology and determine whether it will perform as intended, conforms to the Seller's
specifications, and is safe for use as intended. The Seller will conduct safety and hazard analyses
on such technology and will supply the Secretary with all such information.
(3) Certificate
For anti-terrorism technology reviewed and approved by the Secretary, the Secretary will issue
a certificate of conformance to the Seller and place the anti-terrorism technology on an Approved
Product List for Homeland Security.
(e) Exclusion
Nothing in this section shall in any way limit the ability of any person to seek any form of
recovery from any person, government, or other entity that—
(1) attempts to commit, knowingly participates in, aids and abets, or commits any act of
terrorism, or any criminal act related to or resulting from such act of terrorism; or
(2) participates in a conspiracy to commit any such act of terrorism or any such criminal act.

§443. Risk management
(a) In general
(1) Liability insurance required
Any person or entity that sells or otherwise provides a qualified anti-terrorism technology to
Federal and non-Federal Government customers ("Seller") shall obtain liability insurance of such
types and in such amounts as shall be required in accordance with this section and certified by the
Secretary to satisfy otherwise compensable third-party claims arising out of, relating to, or
resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed
in defense against or response or recovery from such act.
(2) Maximum amount
For the total claims related to 1 such act of terrorism, the Seller is not required to obtain liability
insurance of more than the maximum amount of liability insurance reasonably available from
private sources on the world market at prices and terms that will not unreasonably distort the sales
price of Seller's anti-terrorism technologies.
[Release Point 118-106]
(3) Scope of coverage
Liability insurance obtained pursuant to this subsection shall, in addition to the Seller, protect
the following, to the extent of their potential liability for involvement in the manufacture,
qualification, sale, use, or operation of qualified anti-terrorism technologies deployed in defense
against or response or recovery from an act of terrorism:
(A) Contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, vendors and customers of the Seller.
(B) Contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, and vendors of the customer.
(4) Third party claims
Such liability insurance under this section shall provide coverage against third party claims
arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the sale or use of anti-terrorism technologies.
(b) Reciprocal waiver of claims
The Seller shall enter into a reciprocal waiver of claims with its contractors, subcontractors,
suppliers, vendors and customers, and contractors and subcontractors of the customers, involved in
the manufacture, sale, use or operation of qualified anti-terrorism technologies, under which each
party to the waiver agrees to be responsible for losses, including business interruption losses, that it
sustains, or for losses sustained by its own employees resulting from an activity resulting from an act
of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed in defense against or
response or recovery from such act.
(c) Extent of liability
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, liability for all claims against a Seller arising out of,
relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been
deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may
result in loss to the Seller, whether for compensatory or punitive damages or for contribution or
indemnity, shall not be in an amount greater than the limits of liability insurance coverage required
to be maintained by the Seller under this section.

[Release Point 118-106]
§466. Sense of Congress reaffirming the continued importance and applicability
of the Posse Comitatus Act
(a) Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) Section 1385 of title 18 (commonly known as the "Posse Comitatus Act") prohibits the use
of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws except in cases and under
circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.
(2) Enacted in 1878, the Posse Comitatus Act was expressly intended to prevent United States
Marshals, on their own initiative, from calling on the Army for assistance in enforcing Federal
law.
(3) The Posse Comitatus Act has served the Nation well in limiting the use of the Armed Forces
to enforce the law.
(4) Nevertheless, by its express terms, the Posse Comitatus Act is not a complete barrier to the
use of the Armed Forces for a range of domestic purposes, including law enforcement functions,
when the use of the Armed Forces is authorized by Act of Congress or the President determines
that the use of the Armed Forces is required to fulfill the President's obligations under the
Constitution to respond promptly in time of war, insurrection, or other serious emergency.
(5) Existing laws, including chapter 13 of title 10 (commonly known as the "Insurrection Act"),
and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et
seq.), grant the President broad powers that may be invoked in the event of domestic emergencies,
including an attack against the Nation using weapons of mass destruction, and these laws
specifically authorize the President to use the Armed Forces to help restore public order.
(b) Sense of Congress
Congress reaffirms the continued importance of section 1385 of title 18, and it is the sense of
Congress that nothing in this chapter should be construed to alter the applicability of such section to
any use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws.

STATUTORY NOTES AND RELATED SUBSIDIARIES
FINDINGS
Pub. L. 114–22, title III, §302(a), May 29, 2015, 129 Stat. 251, provided that: "Congress finds the
following:
"(1) The illegal market for the production and distribution of child abuse imagery is a growing threat to
children in the United States. International demand for this material creates a powerful incentive for the
rape, abuse, and torture of children within the United States.
"(2) The targeting of United States children by international criminal networks is a threat to the
homeland security of the United States. This threat must be fought with trained personnel and highly
specialized counter-child-exploitation strategies and technologies.
"(3) The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the Department of Homeland
Security serves a critical national security role in protecting the United States from the growing
international threat of child exploitation and human trafficking.
"(4) The Cyber Crimes Center of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a vital
national resource in the effort to combat international child exploitation, providing advanced expertise and
assistance in investigations, computer forensics, and victim identification.
"(5) The returning military heroes of the United States possess unique and valuable skills that can
assist law enforcement in combating global sexual and child exploitation, and the Department of Homeland
Security should use this national resource to the maximum extent possible.
"(6) Through the Human Exploitation Rescue Operative (HERO) Child Rescue Corps program, the
[Release Point 118-106]
returning military heroes of the United States are trained and hired to investigate crimes of child
exploitation in order to target predators and rescue children from sexual abuse and slavery."

PART I—INFORMATION SHARING
§481. Short title; findings; and sense of Congress
(a) Short title
This part may be cited as the "Homeland Security Information Sharing Act".
(b) Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) The Federal Government is required by the Constitution to provide for the common defense,
which includes terrorist attack.
(2) The Federal Government relies on State and local personnel to protect against terrorist
attack.
(3) The Federal Government collects, creates, manages, and protects classified and sensitive but
unclassified information to enhance homeland security.
(4) Some homeland security information is needed by the State and local personnel to prevent
and prepare for terrorist attack.
(5) The needs of State and local personnel to have access to relevant homeland security
information to combat terrorism must be reconciled with the need to preserve the protected status
of such information and to protect the sources and methods used to acquire such information.
(6) Granting security clearances to certain State and local personnel is one way to facilitate the
sharing of information regarding specific terrorist threats among Federal, State, and local levels of
government.
(7) Methods exist to declassify, redact, or otherwise adapt classified information so it may be
shared with State and local personnel without the need for granting additional security clearances.
[Release Point 118-106]
(8) State and local personnel have capabilities and opportunities to gather information on
suspicious activities and terrorist threats not possessed by Federal agencies.
(9) The Federal Government and State and local governments and agencies in other
jurisdictions may benefit from such information.
(10) Federal, State, and local governments and intelligence, law enforcement, and other
emergency preparation and response agencies must act in partnership to maximize the benefits of
information gathering and analysis to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.
(11) Information systems, including the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications
System and the Terrorist Threat Warning System, have been established for rapid sharing of
classified and sensitive but unclassified information among Federal, State, and local entities.
(12) Increased efforts to share homeland security information should avoid duplicating existing
information systems.
(c) Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that Federal, State, and local entities should share homeland security
information to the maximum extent practicable, with special emphasis on hard-to-reach urban and
rural communities.

Immigration Services to mitigate identified problems.
(3) Specification of the funds available to each agency that will be transferred to the Department as a
result of transfers under the plan.
• The attached tables [not set out in the Code] provide estimates of the funds available to the agencies
and entities that will be transferred to the Department by operation of the Act. The two tables include total
funding (mandatory and discretionary including fees) and discretionary funding net of fees. The tables
provide the enacted levels for 2002 and 2002 supplementals, and the President's requested levels for 2003.
Because of the current state of the 2003 budget process, information concerning the funds that will
be available to each transferring agency on the date of the proposed transfers is not currently
available and will not likely be available during the time period in which the President is to submit
this Reorganization Plan. As additional information becomes available, it will be provided as may be
required in accordance with the procedures under the Act for modification of this Plan or other
applicable law.
(4) Specification of the proposed allocations within the Department of unexpended funds transferred
in connection with transfers under the plan.
• The attached tables [not set out in the Code] provide estimates of the unobligated balances as of
September 30, 2002, for the agencies and programs that will be transferred to the Department. The first
table provides estimates of unobligated balances for the accounts that are moving to the Department in
whole. The second table provides estimates of the unobligated balances in the accounts of which only a
portion will be transferring to the new Department. These latter estimates, however, are of the unobligated
balances for the full account, only a portion of which are associated with the activities that will be
transferred to the Department. In addition, these unobligated balances are based on the Department of
Treasury's estimates as of September 30, 2002, which are the latest available figures. Since October 1,
2002, Departments and agencies (except the Department of Defense) have been operating under continuing
resolutions, and, as such, have been spending these balances to maintain current operations.
Authority to reallocate unexpended funds of agencies transferred under this Plan is found in H.J.
Res. 124 [Pub. L. 107–294, Nov. 23, 2002, 116 Stat. 2062], the continuing resolution in effect
currently and until January 11, 2003. The resolution provides authority for the Office of
Management and Budget to transfer an amount not to exceed $140,000,000 from unobligated
balances of appropriations enacted before October 1, 2002 "for organizations and entities that will be
transferred to the new Department and for salaries and expenses associated with the initiation of the
Department." Such authority may be exercised upon providing 15 days' notice to the Appropriations
Committees. We anticipate that it may be necessary to provide funding through such transfers both
for transferring entities and for salaries and expenses associated with the initiation of the
Department, including, for example, those associated with establishing the Office of the Secretary
and other new offices provided for in the Act. Any plan to use such funding will follow the
procedures required under the continuing resolution, including the provision of at least 15 days'
notice to the Appropriations Committees.
(5) Specification of any proposed disposition of property, facilities, contracts, records, and other
assets and obligations of agencies transferred under the plan.
• There is no intention to dispose of property, facility, contracts, records, and other assets and
obligations of agencies transferred under the plan. All of such assets and obligations will transfer with each
agency pursuant to Section 1511(d)(1) of the Act [6 U.S.C. 551(d)(1)].
• Prior to and during the transition period (as defined by Section 1501(a)(2) of the Act [6 U.S.C.
541(a)(2)]), the Department may identify property, facilities, contracts, records, and other assets and
obligations of agencies transferred that would be candidates for disposition due to duplication, non-use,
obsolescence, and the like. If and when any such proposed dispositions are identified, we will follow
provisions of the Act relating to modification of this plan or further notification of Congress.
[Release Point 118-106]
(6) Specification of the proposed allocations within the Department of the functions of the agencies
and subdivisions that are not related directly to securing the homeland.
• As agencies and subdivisions are transferred into the Department, any functions of those entities that
are not directly related to securing the homeland will continue to be allocated to the agencies and
subdivisions in which they are currently incorporated.

REORGANIZATION PLAN MODIFICATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY
JANUARY 30, 2003
H. DOC. NO. 108–32, 108TH CONGRESS, 1ST SESSION, PROVIDED:
INTRODUCTION
This Reorganization Plan Modification is submitted pursuant to the Homeland Security Act ("the Act") of
2002 [Pub. L. 107–296, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2135]. All elements of the Department of Homeland Security
Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002 ("the Plan") [set out above] remain as submitted except for those
modifications addressed herein.
PURPOSE OF MODIFICATION
This modification of the Plan is to establish and specify organizational units within the Border and
Transportation Security Directorate. This modification presents a structural change, but does not consolidate,
discontinue, or diminish transferred agencies' current operations in the field.
PLAN MODIFICATIONS
(a) Rename the "Bureau of Border Security" the "Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement." As
required by the Act, this Bureau will be headed by an Assistant Secretary who will report directly to the
Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security.
This Bureau will comprise Immigration Naturalization Service (INS) interior enforcement functions,
including the detention and removal program, the intelligence program, and the investigations program. At
the same time, pursuant to this modification, the interior enforcement resources and missions of the
Customs Service and the Federal Protective Service will be added to this Bureau. The mission of the Bureau
is:
1. To enforce the full range of immigration and customs laws within the interior of the United States;
[Release Point 118-106]
and,
2. To protect specified federal buildings.
The Assistant Secretary will:
1. Establish and oversee the administration of the policies for performing the detention and removal
program, the intelligence program, and the investigation program functions as are—
(a) transferred to the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security by Section 441 of
the Act [6 U.S.C. 251] and delegated to the Assistant Secretary by the Under Secretary for Border and
Transportation Security; or
(b) otherwise vested in the Assistant Secretary by law.
2. Advise the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security with respect to any policy or
operation of the Bureau that may affect the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services established
under subtitle E of the Act [probably means subtitle E of title IV of the Act, 6 U.S.C. 271 et seq.], including
potentially conflicting policies and operations.
(b) Rename the "Customs Service" the "Bureau of Customs and Border Protection." This Bureau will be
headed by the Commissioner of Customs and will report to the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation
Security.
The Bureau will contain the resources and missions relating to borders and ports of entry of the
Customs Service, the INS, including the Border Patrol and the inspections program, and the agricultural
inspections function of the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection program.
The Commissioner will:
1. Establish and oversee the administration of the policies for performing the Border Patrol and
inspections program functions as are—
(a) transferred to the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security by Section 441 of
the Act [6 U.S.C. 251] and delegated to the Commissioner by the Under Secretary for Border and
Transportation Security; or
(b) otherwise vested in the Assistant Secretary [probably should be "Commissioner"] by law.
2. Advise the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security with respect to any policy or
operation of the Bureau that may affect the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services established
under subtitle E of the Act [probably means subtitle E of title IV of the Act, 6 U.S.C. 271 et seq.], including
potentially conflicting policies and operations.
IMPLEMENTATION DATE
March 1, 2003
ELEMENTS REQUIRED BY THE ACT TO BE SUBMITTED WITH MODIFIED PLAN
(1) Identification of any functions of agencies transferred to the Department pursuant to this Act that will
not be transferred to the Department under the plan.
None.
(2) Specification of the steps to be taken by the Secretary to organize the Department, including the
delegation or assignment of functions transferred to the Department among officers of the Department in
order to permit the Department to carry out the functions transferred under the plan.
See plan modifications above.
(3) Specification of the funds available to each agency that will be transferred to the Department as a result
of transfers under the plan.
The table attached at Tab A [not set out in the Code] provides estimates of the funds available to the
agencies affected by this modification that will be transferred to the Department by operation of the Act. The
table includes total funding (mandatory and discretionary including fees) and discretionary funding net of
fees. The table provides the President's requested levels for 2003.
Because of the current state of the 2003 budget process, information concerning the funds that will be
available to each transferring agency on the date of the proposed transfers is not currently available. As
additional information becomes available, it will be provided as may be required in accordance with the
procedures under the Act for modification of this Plan or other applicable law.
(4) Specification of the proposed allocations within the Department of unexpended funds transferred in
connection with transfers under the plan.
The table attached at Tab B [not set out in the Code] provides updated estimates of the unobligated balances
as of September 30, 2002, for the agencies affected by this modification that will be transferred to the
Department. Since October 1, 2002, these agencies have been operating under continuing resolutions, and, as
[Release Point 118-106]
such, have been spending these balances to maintain current operations. As additional information becomes
available, it will be provided as may be required in accordance with the procedures under the Act for
modification of this Plan or other applicable law.
(5) Specification of any proposed disposition of property, facilities, contracts, records, and other assets and
obligations of agencies transferred under the plan.
There is no intention to dispose of property, facilities, contracts, records, and other assets and obligations of
agencies transferred under this modification. All such assets and obligations will transfer with each agency
pursuant to Section 1511(d)(1) of the Act [6 U.S.C. 551(d)(1)].
(6) Specification of the proposed allocations within the Department of the functions of the agencies and
subdivisions that are not related directly to securing the homeland.
The functions of the agencies affected by this modification that are not directly related to securing the
homeland will continue to be performed by the bureaus formed by this planned reorganization.

STATUTORY NOTES AND RELATED SUBSIDIARIES
FINDINGS
Pub. L. 111–140, §2, Feb. 16, 2010, 124 Stat. 31, provided that: "Congress finds the following:
"(1) The threat of a nuclear terrorist attack on American interests, both domestic and abroad, is one of
the most serious threats to the national security of the United States. In the wake of an attack, attribution of
responsibility would be of utmost importance. Because of the destructive power of a nuclear weapon, there
could be little forensic evidence except the radioactive material in the weapon itself.
"(2) Through advanced nuclear forensics, using both existing techniques and those under development,
it may be possible to identify the source and pathway of a weapon or material after it is interdicted or
detonated. Though identifying intercepted smuggled material is now possible in some cases, pre-detonation
forensics is a relatively undeveloped field. The post-detonation nuclear forensics field is also immature, and
the challenges are compounded by the pressures and time constraints of performing forensics after a nuclear
or radiological attack.
"(3) A robust and well-known capability to identify the source of nuclear or radiological material
intended for or used in an act of terror could also deter prospective proliferators. Furthermore, the threat of
effective attribution could compel improved security at material storage facilities, preventing the unwitting
transfer of nuclear or radiological materials.
"(4)(A) In order to identify special nuclear material and other radioactive materials confidently, it is
necessary to have a robust capability to acquire samples in a timely manner, analyze and characterize
samples, and compare samples against known signatures of nuclear and radiological material.
"(B) Many of the radioisotopes produced in the detonation of a nuclear device have short half-lives, so
the timely acquisition of samples is of the utmost importance. Over the past several decades, the ability of
the United States to gather atmospheric samples—often the preferred method of sample acquisition—has
diminished. This ability must be restored and modern techniques that could complement or replace existing
techniques should be pursued.
"(C) The discipline of pre-detonation forensics is a relatively undeveloped field. The radiation
associated with a nuclear or radiological device may affect traditional forensics techniques in unknown
ways. In a post-detonation scenario, radiochemistry may provide the most useful tools for analysis and
characterization of samples. The number of radiochemistry programs and radiochemists in United States
[Release Point 118-106]
National Laboratories and universities has dramatically declined over the past several decades. The
narrowing pipeline of qualified people into this critical field is a serious impediment to maintaining a robust
and credible nuclear forensics program.
"(5) Once samples have been acquired and characterized, it is necessary to compare the results against
samples of known material from reactors, weapons, and enrichment facilities, and from medical, academic,
commercial, and other facilities containing such materials, throughout the world. Some of these samples are
available to the International Atomic Energy Agency through safeguards agreements, and some countries
maintain internal sample databases. Access to samples in many countries is limited by national security
concerns.
"(6) In order to create a sufficient deterrent, it is necessary to have the capability to positively identify
the source of nuclear or radiological material, and potential traffickers in nuclear or radiological material
must be aware of that capability. International cooperation may be essential to catalogue all existing sources
of nuclear or radiological material."

and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5133, 5170 et seq., and 5191 et seq.)) coordinate, as
appropriate, their prevention, preparedness, and protection efforts with neighboring State, local,
and tribal governments; and
(2) all high-risk urban areas and other recipients of grants administered by the Department to
prevent, prepare for, protect against, or respond to natural disasters, acts of terrorism, or other
man-made disasters (excluding assistance provided under section 203, title IV, or title V of the
Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5133, 5170 et seq.,
and 5191 et seq.)) that include or substantially affect parts or all of more than 1 State coordinate,
as appropriate, across State boundaries, including, where appropriate, through the use of regional
working groups and requirements for regional plans.
(b) Planning committees
(1) In general
Any State or high-risk urban area receiving a grant under section 604 or 605 of this title shall
establish a State planning committee or urban area working group to assist in preparation and
revision of the State, regional, or local homeland security plan or the threat and hazard
identification and risk assessment, as the case may be, and to assist in determining effective
funding priorities for grants under such sections.
(2) Composition
(A) In general
The State planning committees and urban area working groups referred to in paragraph (1)
shall include at least one representative from each of the following significant stakeholders:

[Release Point 118-106]
(c) Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that, in order to ensure that the Nation is most effectively able to
prevent, prepare for, protect against, and respond to all hazards, including natural disasters, acts of
terrorism, and other man-made disasters—
(1) the Department should administer a coherent and coordinated system of both
terrorism-focused and all-hazards grants;
(2) there should be a continuing and appropriate balance between funding for terrorism-focused
and all-hazards preparedness, as reflected in the authorizations of appropriations for grants under
the amendments made by titles I and II, as applicable, of the Implementing Recommendations of
the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007; and
(3) with respect to terrorism-focused grants, it is necessary to ensure both that the target
capabilities of the highest risk areas are achieved quickly and that basic levels of preparedness, as
measured by the attainment of target capabilities, are achieved nationwide.

(aa) accept a credential from a Federal screening program described in subclause (I) if
an individual who is required to be screened presents such a credential; and
(bb) address in its site security plan or alternative security program the measures it
will take to verify that a credential or documentation from a Federal screening program
described in subclause (I) is current;
(ii) visual inspection shall be sufficient to meet the requirement under clause (i)(II)(bb),
but the facility should consider other means of verification, consistent with the facility's
assessment of the threat posed by acceptance of such credentials; and
(iii) the Secretary may not require a covered chemical facility to submit any information
about an individual unless the individual—
(I) is to be vetted under the Personnel Surety Program; or
(II) has been identified as presenting a terrorism security risk.

chemical facility under section 621(3) of this title no longer met the criteria; and
(II) the basis, in summary form, for each action or determination under subclause (I);
and
(ii) that is provided in a sufficiently anonymized form to ensure that the information does
not identify any specific facility or company as the source of the information when viewed
alone or in combination with other public information;
(C) the average number of days spent reviewing site security or an alternative security
program for a covered chemical facility prior to approval;
(D) the number of covered chemical facilities inspected;
(E) the average number of covered chemical facilities inspected per inspector; and

EXECUTIVE DOCUMENTS
EX. ORD. NO. 13905. STRENGTHENING NATIONAL RESILIENCE THROUGH RESPONSIBLE
USE OF POSITIONING, NAVIGATION, AND TIMING SERVICES
Ex. Ord. No. 13905, Feb. 12, 2020, 85 F.R. 9359, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Purpose. The national and economic security of the United States depends on the reliable and
efficient functioning of critical infrastructure. Since the United States made the Global Positioning System
available worldwide, positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services provided by space-based systems
have become a largely invisible utility for technology and infrastructure, including the electrical power grid,
communications infrastructure and mobile devices, all modes of transportation, precision agriculture, weather
forecasting, and emergency response. Because of the widespread adoption of PNT services, the disruption or
manipulation of these services has the potential to adversely affect the national and economic security of the
United States. To strengthen national resilience, the Federal Government must foster the responsible use of
PNT services by critical infrastructure owners and operators.
SEC. 2. Definitions. As used in this order:
(a) "PNT services" means any system, network, or capability that provides a reference to calculate or
augment the calculation of longitude, latitude, altitude, or transmission of time or frequency data, or any
combination thereof.
(b) "Responsible use of PNT services" means the deliberate, risk-informed use of PNT services, including
their acquisition, integration, and deployment, such that disruption or manipulation of PNT services minimally
affects national security, the economy, public health, and the critical functions of the Federal Government.
(c) "Critical infrastructure" means systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United
States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on
national security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or on any combination of those
matters.
(d) "PNT profile" means a description of the responsible use of PNT services—aligned to standards,
guidelines, and sector-specific requirements—selected for a particular system to address the potential
disruption or manipulation of PNT services.
(e) "Sector-Specific Agency" (SSA) is the executive department or agency that is responsible for providing
institutional knowledge and specialized expertise as well as leading, facilitating, or supporting the security and
resilience programs and associated activities of its designated critical infrastructure sector in the all-hazards
environment. The SSAs are those identified in Presidential Policy Directive 21 of February 12, 2013 (Critical
Infrastructure Security and Resilience).
SEC. 3. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to ensure that disruption or manipulation of PNT
services does not undermine the reliable and efficient functioning of its critical infrastructure. The Federal
Government must increase the Nation's awareness of the extent to which critical infrastructure depends on, or
is enhanced by, PNT services, and it must ensure critical infrastructure can withstand disruption or
manipulation of PNT services.
To this end, the Federal Government shall engage the public and private sectors to identify and promote the
responsible use of PNT services.
SEC. 4. Implementation. (a) Within 1 year of the date of this order [Feb. 12, 2020], the Secretary of
Commerce, in coordination with the heads of SSAs and in consultation, as appropriate, with the private sector,
shall develop and make available, to at least the appropriate agencies and private sector users, PNT profiles.
The PNT profiles will enable the public and private sectors to identify systems, networks, and assets
dependent on PNT services; identify appropriate PNT services; detect the disruption and manipulation of PNT
services; and manage the associated risks to the systems, networks, and assets dependent on PNT services.
Once made available, the PNT profiles shall be reviewed every 2 years and, as necessary, updated.
(b) The Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Transportation, and Secretary of Homeland Security shall refer
to the PNT profiles created pursuant to subsection (a) of this section in updates to the Federal Radionavigation
Plan.
(c) Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the
heads of SSAs, shall develop a plan to test the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure systems, networks, and
assets in the event of disruption and manipulation of PNT services. The results of the tests carried out under
that plan shall be used to inform updates to the PNT profiles identified in subsection (a) of this section.
(d) Within 90 days of the PNT profiles being made available, the heads of SSAs and the heads of other
executive departments and agencies (agencies), as appropriate, through the Secretary of Homeland Security,
[Release Point 118-106]
shall develop contractual language for inclusion of the relevant information from the PNT profiles in the
requirements for Federal contracts for products, systems, and services that integrate or utilize PNT services,
with the goal of encouraging the private sector to use additional PNT services and develop new robust and
secure PNT services. The heads of SSAs and the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall update the
requirements as necessary.
(e) Within 180 days of the completion of any of the duties described in subsection (d) of this section, and
consistent with applicable law and to the maximum extent practicable, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory
Council, in consultation with the heads of SSAs and the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall
incorporate the requirements developed under subsection (d) of this section into Federal contracts for
products, systems, and services that integrate or use PNT services.
(f) Within 1 year of the PNT profiles being made available, and biennially thereafter, the heads of SSAs and
the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, through the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall submit a report
to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Director of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy (OSTP) on the extent to which the PNT profiles have been adopted in their respective
agencies' acquisitions and, to the extent possible, the extent to which PNT profiles have been adopted by
owners and operators of critical infrastructure.
(g) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Transportation, Secretary of Energy, and
Secretary of Homeland Security shall each develop plans to engage with critical infrastructure owners or
operators to evaluate the responsible use of PNT services. Each pilot program shall be completed within 1
year of developing the plan, and the results shall be used to inform the development of the relevant PNT
profile and research and development (R&D) opportunities.
(h) Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Director of OSTP shall coordinate the development of a
national plan, which shall be informed by existing initiatives, for the R&D and pilot testing of additional,
robust, and secure PNT services that are not dependent on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The
plan shall also include approaches to integrate and use multiple PNT services to enhance the resilience of
critical infrastructure.
Once the plan is published, the Director of OSTP shall coordinate updates to the plan every 4 years, or as
appropriate.
(i) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall make available a
GNSS-independent source of Coordinated Universal Time, to support the needs of critical infrastructure
owners and operators, for the public and private sectors to access.
SEC. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary,
administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of
appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural,
enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its
officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

§681d. Noncompliance with required reporting
(a) Purpose
In the event that a covered entity that is required to submit a report under section 681b(a) of this
title fails to comply with the requirement to report, the Director may obtain information about the
cyber incident or ransom payment by engaging the covered entity directly to request information
about the cyber incident or ransom payment, and if the Director is unable to obtain information
through such engagement, by issuing a subpoena to the covered entity, pursuant to subsection (c), to
gather information sufficient to determine whether a covered cyber incident or ransom payment has
occurred.
(b) Initial request for information
(1) In general
If the Director has reason to believe, whether through public reporting or other information in
the possession of the Federal Government, including through analysis performed pursuant to
paragraph (1) or (2) of section 681a(a) of this title, that a covered entity has experienced a covered
cyber incident or made a ransom payment but failed to report such cyber incident or payment to
the Agency in accordance with section 681b(a) of this title, the Director may request additional
information from the covered entity to confirm whether or not a covered cyber incident or ransom
payment has occurred.
(2) Treatment
Information provided to the Agency in response to a request under paragraph (1) shall be treated
as if it was submitted through the reporting procedures established in section 681b of this title 1
including that section 681e of this title shall apply to such information in the same manner and to
the same extent to information submitted in response to requests under paragraph (1) as it applies
to information submitted under section 681b of this title.
(c) Enforcement
[Release Point 118-106]
(1) In general
If, after the date that is 72 hours from the date on which the Director made the request for
information in subsection (b), the Director has received no response from the covered entity from
which such information was requested, or received an inadequate response, the Director may issue
to such covered entity a subpoena to compel disclosure of information the Director deems
necessary to determine whether a covered cyber incident or ransom payment has occurred and
obtain the information required to be reported pursuant to section 681b of this title and any
implementing regulations, and assess potential impacts to national security, economic security, or
public health and safety.
(2) Civil action
(A) In general
If a covered entity fails to comply with a subpoena, the Director may refer the matter to the
Attorney General to bring a civil action in a district court of the United States to enforce such
subpoena.
(B) Venue
An action under this paragraph may be brought in the judicial district in which the covered
entity against which the action is brought resides, is found, or does business.
(C) Contempt of court
A court may punish a failure to comply with a subpoena issued under this subsection as
contempt of court.
(3) Non-delegation
The authority of the Director to issue a subpoena under this subsection may not be delegated.
(4) Authentication
(A) In general
Any subpoena issued electronically pursuant to this subsection shall be authenticated with a
cryptographic digital signature of an authorized representative of the Agency, or other
comparable successor technology, that allows the Agency to demonstrate that such subpoena
was issued by the Agency and has not been altered or modified since such issuance.
(B) Invalid if not authenticated
Any subpoena issued electronically pursuant to this subsection that is not authenticated in
accordance with subparagraph (A) shall not be considered to be valid by the recipient of such
subpoena.
(d) Provision of certain information to Attorney General
(1) In general
Notwithstanding section 681e(a)(5) of this title and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if the
Director determines, based on the information provided in response to a subpoena issued pursuant
to subsection (c), that the facts relating to the cyber incident or ransom payment at issue may
constitute grounds for a regulatory enforcement action or criminal prosecution, the Director may
provide such information to the Attorney General or the head of the appropriate Federal regulatory
agency, who may use such information for a regulatory enforcement action or criminal
prosecution.
(2) Consultation
The Director may consult with the Attorney General or the head of the appropriate Federal
regulatory agency when making the determination under paragraph (1).
(e) Considerations
When determining whether to exercise the authorities provided under this section, the Director
[Release Point 118-106]
shall take into consideration—
(1) the complexity in determining if a covered cyber incident has occurred; and
(2) prior interaction with the Agency or awareness of the covered entity of the policies and
procedures of the Agency for reporting covered cyber incidents and ransom payments.
(f) Exclusions
This section shall not apply to a State, local, Tribal, or territorial government entity.
(g) Report to Congress
The Director shall submit to Congress an annual report on the number of times the Director—
(1) issued an initial request for information pursuant to subsection (b);
(2) issued a subpoena pursuant to subsection (c); or
(3) referred a matter to the Attorney General for a civil action pursuant to subsection (c)(2).
(h) Publication of the annual report

the complainant resided on the date of such violation. The petition for review must be filed not
later than 60 days after the date of the issuance of the final order of the Secretary of Labor.
Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5. The commencement of proceedings under this
subparagraph shall not, unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the order.

under subparagraph (A) shall not be subject to judicial review in any criminal or other civil
proceeding.

determines such award is appropriate.

With respect to a complaint under paragraph (1), if the Secretary of Labor has not issued a final
decision within 210 days after the filing of the complaint and if the delay is not due to the bad
faith of the employee, the employee may bring an original action at law or equity for de novo
review in the appropriate district court of the United States, which shall have jurisdiction over
[Release Point 118-106]
such an action without regard to the amount in controversy, and which action shall, at the request

§1169. Railroad tank car security testing
(a) Railroad tank car vulnerability assessment
(1) Assessment
The Secretary shall assess the likely methods of a deliberate terrorist attack against a railroad
tank car used to transport toxic-inhalation-hazard materials, and for each method assessed, the
degree to which it may be successful in causing death, injury, or serious adverse effects to human
health, the environment, critical infrastructure, national security, the national economy, or public
welfare.
(2) Threats
In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider the most current threat information as
to likely methods of a successful terrorist attack on a railroad tank car transporting
toxic-inhalation-hazard materials, and may consider the following:
(A) Explosive devices placed along the tracks or attached to a railroad tank car.
(B) The use of missiles, grenades, rockets, mortars, or other high-caliber weapons against a
railroad tank car.
(3) Physical testing
In developing the assessment required under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall conduct physical
testing of the vulnerability of railroad tank cars used to transport toxic-inhalation-hazard materials
to different methods of a deliberate attack, using technical information and criteria to evaluate the
structural integrity of railroad tank cars.
(4) Report
Not later than 30 days after the completion of the assessment under paragraph (1), the Secretary
shall provide to the appropriate congressional committees a report, in the appropriate format, on
such assessment.
(b) Railroad tank car dispersion modeling
(1) In general
The Secretary, acting through the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center, shall
conduct an air dispersion modeling analysis of release scenarios of toxic-inhalation-hazard
materials resulting from a terrorist attack on a loaded railroad tank car carrying such materials in
urban and rural environments.
(2) Considerations
The analysis under this subsection shall take into account the following considerations:
(A) The most likely means of attack and the resulting dispersal rate.
(B) Different times of day, to account for differences in cloud coverage and other
atmospheric conditions in the environment being modeled.
(C) Differences in population size and density.
(D) Historically accurate wind speeds, temperatures, and wind directions.
(E) Differences in dispersal rates or other relevant factors related to whether a railroad tank
[Release Point 118-106]
car is in motion or stationary.
(F) Emergency response procedures by local officials.
(G) Any other considerations the Secretary believes would develop an accurate, plausible
dispersion model for toxic-inhalation-hazard materials released from a railroad tank car as a
result of a terrorist act.
(3) Consultation
In conducting the dispersion modeling under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult with the
Secretary of Transportation, hazardous materials experts, railroad carriers, nonprofit employee
labor organizations representing railroad employees, appropriate State, local, and tribal officials,
and other Federal agencies, as appropriate.
(4) Information sharing
Upon completion of the analysis required under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall share the
information developed with the appropriate stakeholders, given appropriate information protection
provisions as may be required by the Secretary.
(5) Report
Not later than 30 days after completion of all dispersion analyses under paragraph (1), the
Secretary shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report detailing the
Secretary's conclusions and findings in an appropriate format.

EXECUTIVE DOCUMENTS
EX. ORD. NO. 13800. STRENGTHENING THE CYBERSECURITY OF FEDERAL NETWORKS
AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Ex. Ord. No. 13800, May 11, 2017, 82 F.R. 22391, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
and to protect American innovation and values, it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Cybersecurity of Federal Networks.
(a) Policy. The executive branch operates its information technology (IT) on behalf of the American people.
Its IT and data should be secured responsibly using all United States Government capabilities. The President
will hold heads of executive departments and agencies (agency heads) accountable for managing
cybersecurity risk to their enterprises. In addition, because risk management decisions made by agency heads
can affect the risk to the executive branch as a whole, and to national security, it is also the policy of the
United States to manage cybersecurity risk as an executive branch enterprise.
(b) Findings.
(i) Cybersecurity risk management comprises the full range of activities undertaken to protect IT and data
from unauthorized access and other cyber threats, to maintain awareness of cyber threats, to detect anomalies
and incidents adversely affecting IT and data, and to mitigate the impact of, respond to, and recover from
incidents. Information sharing facilitates and supports all of these activities.
(ii) The executive branch has for too long accepted antiquated and difficult-to-defend IT.
(iii) Effective risk management involves more than just protecting IT and data currently in place. It also
requires planning so that maintenance, improvements, and modernization occur in a coordinated way and with
appropriate regularity.
(iv) Known but unmitigated vulnerabilities are among the highest cybersecurity risks faced by executive
departments and agencies (agencies). Known vulnerabilities include using operating systems or hardware
beyond the vendor's support lifecycle, declining to implement a vendor's security patch, or failing to execute
security-specific configuration guidance.
(v) Effective risk management requires agency heads to lead integrated teams of senior executives with
expertise in IT, security, budgeting, acquisition, law, privacy, and human resources.
(c) Risk Management.
(i) Agency heads will be held accountable by the President for implementing risk management measures
commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm that would result from unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of IT and data. They will also be held accountable by the
President for ensuring that cybersecurity risk management processes are aligned with strategic, operational,
and budgetary planning processes, in accordance with chapter 35, subchapter II of title 44, United States
Code.
(ii) Effective immediately, each agency head shall use The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity (the Framework) developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or any
successor document, to manage the agency's cybersecurity risk. Each agency head shall provide a risk
[Release Point 118-106]
management report to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) within 90 days of the date of this order. The risk management report shall:
(A) document the risk mitigation and acceptance choices made by each agency head as of the date of
this order, including:
(1) the strategic, operational, and budgetary considerations that informed those choices; and
(2) any accepted risk, including from unmitigated vulnerabilities; and
(B) describe the agency's action plan to implement the Framework.
(iii) The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of OMB, consistent with chapter 35, subchapter
II of title 44, United States Code, shall jointly assess each agency's risk management report to determine
whether the risk mitigation and acceptance choices set forth in the reports are appropriate and sufficient to
manage the cybersecurity risk to the executive branch enterprise in the aggregate (the determination).
(iv) The Director of OMB, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, with appropriate
support from the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of General Services, and within 60 days of
receipt of the agency risk management reports outlined in subsection (c)(ii) of this section, shall submit to the
President, through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, the following:
(A) the determination; and
(B) a plan to:
(1) adequately protect the executive branch enterprise, should the determination identify
insufficiencies;
(2) address immediate unmet budgetary needs necessary to manage risk to the executive branch
enterprise;
(3) establish a regular process for reassessing and, if appropriate, reissuing the determination, and
addressing future, recurring unmet budgetary needs necessary to manage risk to the executive branch
enterprise;
(4) clarify, reconcile, and reissue, as necessary and to the extent permitted by law, all policies,
standards, and guidelines issued by any agency in furtherance of chapter 35, subchapter II of title 44, United
States Code, and, as necessary and to the extent permitted by law, issue policies, standards, and guidelines
in furtherance of this order; and
(5) align these policies, standards, and guidelines with the Framework.
(v) The agency risk management reports described in subsection (c)(ii) of this section and the determination
and plan described in subsections (c)(iii) and (iv) of this section may be classified in full or in part, as
appropriate.
(vi) Effective immediately, it is the policy of the executive branch to build and maintain a modern, secure,
and more resilient executive branch IT architecture.
(A) Agency heads shall show preference in their procurement for shared IT services, to the extent
permitted by law, including email, cloud, and cybersecurity services.
(B) The Director of the American Technology Council shall coordinate a report to the President from
the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of OMB, and the Administrator of General Services, in
consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, as appropriate, regarding modernization of Federal IT. The
report shall:
(1) be completed within 90 days of the date of this order; and
(2) describe the legal, policy, and budgetary considerations relevant to—as well as the technical
feasibility and cost effectiveness, including timelines and milestones, of—transitioning all agencies, or a
subset of agencies, to:
(aa) one or more consolidated network architectures; and
(bb) shared IT services, including email, cloud, and cybersecurity services.
(C) The report described in subsection (c)(vi)(B) of this section shall assess the effects of transitioning
all agencies, or a subset of agencies, to shared IT services with respect to cybersecurity, including by
making recommendations to ensure consistency with [former] section 227 [now 2209] of the Homeland
Security Act ([former] 6 U.S.C. 148) [now 6 U.S.C. 659] and compliance with policies and practices issued
in accordance with section 3553 of title 44, United States Code. All agency heads shall supply such
information concerning their current IT architectures and plans as is necessary to complete this report on
time.
(vii) For any National Security System, as defined in section 3552(b)(6) of title 44, United States Code, the
Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, rather than the Secretary of Homeland Security
and the Director of OMB, shall implement this order to the maximum extent feasible and appropriate. The
Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence shall provide a report to the Assistant to the
President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and
[Release Point 118-106]
Counterterrorism describing their implementation of subsection (c) of this section within 150 days of the date
of this order. The report described in this subsection shall include a justification for any deviation from the

Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure) [set out above], each emphasize [sic] that a superior
cybersecurity workforce will promote American prosperity and preserve peace. America's cybersecurity
workforce is a diverse group of practitioners who govern, design, defend, analyze, administer, operate, and
maintain the data, systems, and networks on which our economy and way of life depend. Whether they are
employed in the public or private sectors, they are guardians of our national and economic security.
(b) The United States Government must enhance the workforce mobility of America's cybersecurity
practitioners to improve America's national cybersecurity. During their careers, America's cybersecurity
practitioners will serve in various roles for multiple and diverse entities. United States Government policy
must facilitate the seamless movement of cybersecurity practitioners between the public and private sectors,
maximizing the contributions made by their diverse skills, experiences, and talents to our Nation.
(c) The United States Government must support the development of cybersecurity skills and encourage
ever-greater excellence so that America can maintain its competitive edge in cybersecurity. The United States
Government must also recognize and reward the country's highest-performing cybersecurity practitioners and
teams.
(d) The United States Government must create the organizational and technological tools required to
maximize the cybersecurity talents and capabilities of American workers—especially when those talents and
capabilities can advance our national and economic security. The Nation is experiencing a shortage of
cybersecurity talent and capability, and innovative approaches are required to improve access to training that
maximizes individuals' cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and abilities. Training opportunities, such as
work-based learning, apprenticeships, and blended learning approaches, must be enhanced for both new
workforce entrants and those who are advanced in their careers.
(e) In accordance with Executive Order 13800, the President will continue to hold heads of executive
departments and agencies (agencies) accountable for managing cybersecurity risk to their enterprises, which
[Release Point 118-106]
includes ensuring the effectiveness of their cybersecurity workforces.
SEC. 2. Strengthening the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce. (a) To grow the cybersecurity capability of the
United States Government, increase integration of the Federal cybersecurity workforce, and strengthen the
skills of Federal information technology and cybersecurity practitioners, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Director of the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM), shall establish a cybersecurity rotational assignment program, which
will serve as a mechanism for knowledge transfer and a development program for cybersecurity practitioners.
Within 90 days of the date of this order [May 2, 2019], the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation

levels; and
(v) Peer mentoring to enhance workforce integration.
(b) Consistent with applicable law and to the maximum extent practicable, the Administrator of General
Services, in consultation with the Director of OMB and the Secretary of Commerce, shall:
(i) Incorporate the NICE Framework lexicon and taxonomy into workforce knowledge and skill
requirements used in contracts for information technology and cybersecurity services;
(ii) Ensure that contracts for information technology and cybersecurity services include reporting
requirements that will enable agencies to evaluate whether personnel have the necessary knowledge and skills
to perform the tasks specified in the contract, consistent with the NICE Framework; and
(iii) Provide a report to the President, within 1 year of the date of this order, that describes how the NICE
Framework has been incorporated into contracts for information technology and cybersecurity services,
evaluates the effectiveness of this approach in improving services provided to the United States Government,
and makes recommendations to increase the effective use of the NICE Framework by United States
Government contractors.
(c) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of OPM, in consultation with the Secretary of
Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall identify
a list of cybersecurity aptitude assessments for agencies to use in identifying current employees with the
potential to acquire cybersecurity skills for placement in reskilling programs to perform cybersecurity work.
Agencies shall incorporate one or more of these assessments into their personnel development programs, as
appropriate and consistent with applicable law.
(d) Agencies shall ensure that existing awards and decorations for the uniformed services and civilian
personnel recognize performance and achievements in the areas of cybersecurity and cyber-operations,
including by ensuring the availability of awards and decorations equivalent to citations issued pursuant to
Executive Order 10694 of January 10, 1957 (Authorizing the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force To
Issue Citations in the Name of the President of the United States to Military and Naval Units for Outstanding
Performance in Action) [22 F.R. 253], as amended. Where necessary and appropriate, agencies shall establish
new awards and decorations to recognize performance and achievements in the areas of cybersecurity and
cyber-operations. The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs may recommend to agencies
that any cyber unified coordination group or similar ad hoc interagency group that has addressed a significant
cybersecurity or cyber-operations-related national security crisis, incident, or effort be recognized for
appropriate awards and decorations.
(e) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Director of the
Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Director of OMB, and the heads of other appropriate agencies,
shall develop a plan for an annual cybersecurity competition (President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition) for
Federal civilian and military employees. The goal of the competition shall be to identify, challenge, and
reward the United States Government's best cybersecurity practitioners and teams across offensive and
defensive cybersecurity disciplines. The plan shall be submitted to the President within 90 days of the date of
this order. The first competition shall be held no later than December 31, 2019, and annually thereafter. The
plan for the competition shall address the following:
[Release Point 118-106]
(i) The challenges and benefits of inviting advisers, participants, or observers from non-Federal entities to
observe or take part in the competition and recommendations for including them in future competitions, as
appropriate;
(ii) How the Department of Energy, through the National Laboratories, in consultation with the
Administrator of the United States Digital Service, can provide expert technical advice and assistance to
support the competition, as appropriate;
(iii) The parameters for the competition, including the development of multiple individual and team events
that test cybersecurity skills related to the NICE Framework and other relevant skills, as appropriate. These
parameters should include competition categories involving individual and team events, software reverse
engineering and exploitation, network operations, forensics, big data analysis, cyber analysis, cyber defense,
cyber exploitation, secure programming, obfuscated coding, cyber-physical systems, and other disciplines;
(iv) How to encourage agencies to select their best cybersecurity practitioners as individual and team
participants. Such practitioners should include Federal employees and uniformed services personnel from
Federal civilian agencies, as well as Department of Defense active duty military personnel, civilians, and those
serving in a drilling reserve capacity in the Armed Forces Reserves or National Guard;
(v) The extent to which agencies, as well as uniformed services, may develop a President's Cup awards
program that is consistent with applicable law and regulations governing awards and that allows for the
provision of cash awards of not less than $25,000. Any such program shall require the agency to establish an
awards program before allowing its employees to participate in the President's Cup Cybersecurity
Competition. In addition, any such program may not preclude agencies from recognizing winning and
non-winning participants through other means, including honorary awards, informal recognition awards,
rating-based cash awards, time-off awards, Quality Step Increases, or other agency-based compensation
flexibilities as appropriate and consistent with applicable law; and
(vi) How the uniformed services, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, may designate service
members who win these competitions as having skills at a time when there is a critical shortage of such skills
within the uniformed services. The plan should also address how the uniformed services may provide winning
service members with a combination of bonuses, advancements, and meritorious recognition to be determined
by the Secretaries of the agencies concerned.
(f) The Director of OMB shall, in consultation with appropriate agencies, develop annually a list of
agencies and subdivisions related to cybersecurity that have a primary function of intelligence,
counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work, including descriptions of such functions. The
Director of OMB shall provide this list to the President, through the Deputy Assistant to the President for
Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (DAPHSCT), every year starting September 1, 2019, for
consideration of whether those agencies or subdivisions should be exempted from coverage under the Federal
Labor-Management Relations Program, consistent with the requirements of section 7103(b)(1) of title 5,
United States Code.
SEC. 3. Strengthening the Nation's Cybersecurity Workforce. (a) The Secretary of Commerce and the
Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretaries), in coordination with the Secretary of Education and the heads
of other agencies as the Secretaries determine is appropriate, shall execute, consistent with applicable law and
to the greatest extent practicable, the recommendations from the report to the President on Supporting the
Growth and Sustainment of the Nation's Cybersecurity Workforce (Workforce Report) developed pursuant to
