    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to stagflation and low market confidence. Expect continued volatility. Sectors like energy and healthcare may outperform due to their defensive nature, while cyclical sectors like finance and manufacturing may underperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction: Set to -0.30 to reflect negative GDP growth and economic momentum. volatility: Set to 0.85 to reflect the high inflation rate. market_sentiment: Aligned with the market confidence of 35%. momentum: Reduced to 0.20 to reflect slowing economic growth. long_term_outlook: Slightly reduced to 0.35 to reflect increased uncertainty."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and geopolitical tensions support energy prices.",

    "FINANCE": "Negative. Higher interest rates and economic slowdown negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Healthcare is generally defensive and less sensitive to economic cycles.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Economic slowdown and higher input costs negatively impact manufacturing.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending may decrease due to inflation, but discount retailers may perform relatively better.",
    "TECH": "Neutral. Some tech companies are defensive, while others are more cyclical. Expect mixed performance.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Economic slowdown and higher fuel costs negatively impact transportation."
