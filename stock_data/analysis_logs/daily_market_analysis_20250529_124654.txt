    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress, indicating focus on macro-level decisions. Public Square discussions suggest some uncertainty and calls for intervention. Executive branch activity is limited. Overall, the sentiment is slightly negative, reflecting economic concerns.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation, negative GDP growth, and elevated unemployment relative to the natural rate all contribute to a bearish outlook. Market confidence is low, reflecting this economic reality.",
    "market_outlook": "The market is expected to be volatile and trend downwards in the short term. High inflation and negative GDP growth will weigh on investor sentiment. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles (e.g., Finance, Entertainment) are likely to underperform, while defensive sectors (e.g., Healthcare, Consumer Staples) may offer some resilience. Energy may see continued strength due to supply constraints.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the Fed target. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence. Momentum is reduced due to the weakening economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic headwinds."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decrease due to economic slowdown.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Higher interest rates and potential for loan defaults weigh on the financial sector.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector and may outperform during economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing activity is likely to slow down due to decreased demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral. Consumer staples may hold up better than discretionary retail, but overall outlook is cautious.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech sector faces headwinds from higher interest rates and potential slowdown in business investment.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Reduced economic activity will lead to lower demand for transportation services."
