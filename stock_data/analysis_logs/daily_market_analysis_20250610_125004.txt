Sectors sensitive to consumer spending (Entertainment, Retail) will likely underperform. Energy may see some support due to inflation.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative to reflect the GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment aligns with low market confidence. Momentum is reduced to reflect the slowing economy. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced, acknowledging the current challenges but not predicting a complete collapse."

    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is negatively impacted by the economic slowdown. CAT and GE are expected to underperform.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector faces challenges due to reduced consumer spending and high inflation. WMT and COST are expected to underperform.",
