HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §1 (Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, §1, 38 Stat. 800; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, §§5,
6(a), 55 Stat. 585).
Said section has been divided. Provisions relating to operation under the Navy in time of war are placed in
sections 3 and 4 of this title, and the remainder is in this section.
This section continues the Coast Guard as a military service and branch of the armed forces of the United
States at all times. By the act of July 11, 1941, 55 Stat. 585 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §1), the Coast Guard
was constituted a branch of the land and naval forces of the United States at all times. This section therefore
merely continues an existing agency and codifies existing law on the military status of the Coast Guard,
substituting "armed forces" for "land and naval forces" because of the recent establishment of the Department
of the Air Force as an "armed force" rather than as a part of the "land and naval forces". The Coast Guard is
designated a service in the Treasury Department except when operating as a service in the Navy. This is a
better definition of the status of the Coast Guard than one which defines it as a service under the Treasury
Department in time of peace, because the President is authorized to place the Coast Guard under the Navy in
time of emergency, which could be in time of peace.
Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
This section defines in general terms, for the first time in any statute, all the primary duties of the Coast
Guard. It is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§45, 50k–50o, 51, 52, 53, 55, 60, 61, 62, 63, 98a, 104,

1948, ch. 672, 62 Stat. 1050).
This section contains a codification of functions. It sets forth in general language the primary
responsibilities of the Coast Guard: enforcement of all Federal laws on waters to which they have application,
safety of life and property at sea, aiding navigation, and readiness to function with the Navy. Having been
created in 1915 by the consolidation of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service, the Coast
[Release Point 118-106]
Guard has gradually been given additional duties and responsibilities, such as the assignment of law
enforcement powers on the high seas and navigable waters in 1936, the transfer of the Lighthouse Service in
1939, and the transfer of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation in 1942. Existing along with these
other duties has been that of maintaining a state of readiness as a specialized service prepared for active
participation with the Navy in time of war. These various interdependent functions of the Service have not
been expressed collectively in any statute heretofore, but it is believed desirable to do so in this revision in
order to have outlined in general terms in one section the broad scope of the functions of the Coast Guard.

§104. Removing restrictions
Any law removing for the duration of a war or national emergency proclaimed by the President
any restriction contained in any then-existing law as applied to the Navy, including, but not limited
to, restrictions relating to the manner in which purchases may be made and contracts awarded, fiscal
operations, and personnel, shall, in the same manner and to the same extent, remove such restrictions
as applied to the Coast Guard.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
This section is new and provides that any law removing for the duration of a war or national emergency any
restriction contained in any then-existing law as applied to the Navy shall operate in the same manner to
remove such restrictions as applied to the Coast Guard. Included are restrictions relating to the manner in
which purchases may be made and contracts awarded, fiscal operations, and personnel. This provision is
designed to enable the Coast Guard to operate as efficiently as the Navy Department in time of war or during a
national emergency and would permit the Coast Guard more effectively to maintain itself in a state of military
readiness during periods of emergency. Since the Coast Guard operates as part of the Navy in time of war, it is
essential that its operations be as flexible and as efficient as those of the Department of which it is to be a part.
This section would prevent inadvertent failures specifically to mention the Coast Guard in legislation of the
type described in this section from hindering service operations. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Said sections have been divided. The provisions of the proviso of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §11a, and the
first proviso of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §12, are placed in section 48 of this title and the remainder is placed
in this section.
The provisions regarding appointment of the Assistant Commandant and Engineer in Chief are coordinated,
inasmuch as these positions are about equal in the Coast Guard organization. The qualification that the
Engineer in Chief be appointed from the active list of engineering officers is changed to the active list of
officers who have qualified for engineering duty, because there is no longer any provision for a corps of
engineering officers. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
This section grants broad general powers concerning policy matters to the Secretary. Many of the powers
are contained in existing law but some are enlarged and some additional powers are added as explained
following.
Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §95 (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). Said
section has been divided. The provision authorizing the Secretary to man stations seems more appropriately
given to the operational head of the Service, the Commandant, and for that reason is incorporated in section
93(c) of this title.
Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§28, 42 (Aug. 16, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; July 3,
1926, ch. 742, §11, 44 Stat. 817). These sections were rewritten in order to broaden existing authority in
regard to the training of Coast Guard personnel at schools of the other armed forces, thus approaching a
practice of war time, and making for economy in the training of Service personnel; such training would be on
a basis mutually satisfactory to the Secretaries involved.
Subsection (c) is based on R.S. 4242 and on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§29, 93, 94, 98a (R.S. 4245, 4249;
May 4, 1882, ch. 117, §2, 22 Stat. 56; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; June 6, 1940, ch. 257, §4, 54 Stat.
247; Aug. 6, 1947, ch. 502, 61 Stat. 786). This subsection broadens existing law in that it provides general
legislative authority for the construction and disposal of shore establishments of all types including aviation
stations.
Subsection (d) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§55, 57, 69, 109, and in part on title 31,
U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§487, 720, (R.S. 2748, 3618, 3692; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §3, 20 Stat. 163; Aug. 29, 1916,
ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). This subsection broadens existing law in that it provides general legislative authority
for the design, construction, acquisition by other means, and disposal of vessels.
Subsection (e) is new. It is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §31b (June 6, 1941, ch. 177, 55 Stat. 247
[which was originally repealed by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, §602(a)(28), 63 Stat. 399, renumbered
Sept. 5, 1950, ch. 849, §6(a), (b), 64 Stat. 583]) which provides for the exchange of vehicles, planes, and
engines; similar authority in relation to vessels, is granted to the Secretary by this subsection and should prove
advantageous to the Government.
Subsection (f) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §96 and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§729, 730, 731
(Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 130, §1, 18 Stat. 372; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 299, 35 Stat. 972; June 17, 1910, ch. 301, §9, 36
Stat. 538; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat. 1018). This subsection broadens the power of the Secretary to
receive as a gift or purchase sites for stations, to include the acquisition of land by any means provided it is for
the purpose of executing duties and functions of the Coast Guard.
Subsection (g) is based in part on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §732 (Aug. 28, 1916, ch. 414, §2, 39 Stat. 538;
July 11, 1941, ch. 290, §1, 55 Stat. 584) and grants authority to the Secretary to exchange interests in land as
payment or part payment for other interests in land for the purpose of executing the duties and functions of the
Coast Guard; this authority, on the basis of past experience, will prove advantageous to the Government.
Subsection (h) is new and merely insures that the Secretary may exercise any of the powers granted to the
Commandant in this title.
Subsection (i) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§51, 131 (R.S. 2756, 2758) and insures that the
Secretary may do anything necessary to carry out the purposes of this title.
Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

GREAT LAKES LIGHTHOUSES
Pub. L. 107–295, title III, §345, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2106, provided that:
"(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following:
"(1) The Great Lakes are home to more than 400 lighthouses. One hundred and twenty of these
maritime landmarks are in the State of Michigan.
"(2) Lighthouses are an important part of Great Lakes culture and stand as a testament to the
importance of shipping in the region's political, economic, and social history.
"(3) Advances in navigation technology have made many Great Lakes lighthouses obsolete. In
Michigan alone, approximately 70 lighthouses will be designated as excess property of the Federal
Government and will be transferred to the General Services Administration for disposal.
"(4) Unfortunately, the Federal property disposal process is confusing, complicated, and not
well-suited to disposal of historic lighthouses or to facilitate transfers to nonprofit organizations. This is
especially troubling because, in many cases, local nonprofit historical organizations have dedicated
tremendous resources to preserving and maintaining Great Lakes lighthouses.
"(5) If Great Lakes lighthouses disappear, the public will be unaware of an important chapter in Great
Lakes history.
"(6) The National Trust for Historic Preservation has placed Michigan lighthouses on their list of Most
Endangered Historic Places.
"(b) ASSISTANCE FOR GREAT LAKES LIGHTHOUSE PRESERVATION EFFORTS.—The Secretary
of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, may—
"(1) continue to offer advice and technical assistance to organizations in the Great Lakes region that
[Release Point 118-106]
are dedicated to lighthouse stewardship; and
"(2) promptly release information regarding the timing of designations of Coast Guard lighthouses on
the Great Lakes as excess to the needs of the Coast Guard, to enable those organizations to mobilize and be
prepared to take appropriate action with respect to the disposal of those properties."

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
This section grants powers to the Commandant concerning, in general, operations within the Service and
the internal functioning of the Service. Many of the powers are contained in existing law, but some are
enlarged, and some additional powers are added as explained following.
Subsection (a) is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §53, and title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §471 (R.S.
1536). The authority to order vessels to cruise along the coasts should be in the operational head of the
Service, and not in the President. This section is changed to cover adequately the necessary present day
cruising and patrolling.
Subsection (b) is derived from R.S. 4242 and title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§29, 93, 94, 95, 97, 98a (R.S.
4245, 4249; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, §§2, 3, 22 Stat. 56; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; Aug. 6, 1947, ch.
502, 61 Stat. 786; June 6, 1940, ch. 257, §4, 54 Stat. 247), and specifically grants to the Commandant
authority in regard to the establishment, discontinuance, and change of Coast Guard shore establishments
other than Coast Guard districts. This power must exist inherently in order for the Service to function
efficiently.
Subsection (c) is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§54, 97, 112 (May 4, 1882, ch. 117, §3, 22 Stat.
56; May 30, 1908, ch. 231, 35 Stat. 553; Apr. 21, 1910, ch. 182, §2, 36 Stat. 326), and specifically grants to
the Commandant authority in regard to the assignment of vessels, vehicles, aids to navigation, and other
[Release Point 118-106]
equipment. This power is inherent to the proper functioning of any Service.
Subsection (d) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §91 (June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §7, 20 Stat. 164; June 10,
1921, ch. 18, §304, 42 Stat. 24; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, §9, 44 Stat. 817). Said section has been divided. The
part dealing with investigation of plans and inventions is covered in this subsection in broader terms, and the
other parts are covered in general terms in section 632 of this title.
Subsection (e) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §111 (June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §9, 20 Stat. 164). This
section has been rewritten to broaden the authority to include any investigation or study that may be of
assistance to the Coast Guard, the limitation as to investigation of shipwrecks having been eliminated.
Subsection (f) is new and is intended to give legislative recognition to the importance of disseminating
information by the Coast Guard for the promotion of safety at sea, life-saving techniques, and other Coast
Guard activities.
Subsection (g) is new and provides for the training of Coast Guard personnel at other than schools or
institutions of the other armed forces. Such training is essential and has been carried on under the authority of
appropriation acts for many years.
Subsection (h) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§69, 108, 109, (R.S. 2748; June 20, 1874, ch.
344, §9, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §3, 20 Stat. 163), and is intended to complement the authority
granted to the Secretary in sec. 92(d) of this title granting similar authority to the Commandant as to smaller
craft.
Subsection (i) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., §§108, 109, and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §752 (June
20, 1874, ch. 344, §9, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §3, 20 Stat. 163; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat.
10183, and grants power to the Commandant to acquire and dispose of various equipment and supplies. The
authority with respect to the acceptance of such equipment as a gift is new.
Subsection (j) is new and grants power to the Commandant to operate and maintain shore establishments;
previously such authority has been inferred from statutes providing for the establishment of shore stations;
again such authority is inherent to the functioning of any Service, and this section will provide no greater
authority than has been exercised in the past.
Subsection (k) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §31b (June 6, 1941, ch. 177, 55 Stat. 247 [which was
originally repealed by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, §602(a)(28), 63 Stat. 399, renumbered Sept. 5,
1950, ch. 849, §6(a), (b), 64 Stat. 583]). The primary authority is granted to the Commandant as well as to the
Secretary inasmuch as such exchange seems to be an operational matter and the items which may be
exchanged have been enlarged by the addition of aids to navigation, appliances, equipment, and supplies.
Inasmuch as the act cited above applies to the Navy as well as the Coast Guard it is not scheduled for repeal
but is being amended by section 13 of this act to eliminate reference to the Coast Guard.
Subsection (l) is new and is deemed desirable in order to give legislative authority for existing yards, and
for the procurement of needed equipment and material in case such is not normally or economically obtainable
from private contractors.
Subsection (m) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§110, 192 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, §6, 18 Stat. 127;
June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §10, 20 Stat. 165; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, §9, 44 Stat. 817). The power to accept
volunteer services is enlarged to include all services offered in time of emergency, to save life or protect
property, and the restrictive provisions relating to lifeboat stations only have been eliminated.
Subsection (n) is new and grants authority to the Commandant to lease real property under the control of the
Coast Guard, when not immediately needed in Coast Guard operations. Such authority will be advantageous
to the Government, on the basis of past experience.
Subsection (o) is new and is supplementary to subsection (n) of this section. It grants further authority to the
Commandant permitting him to grant minor interests in land which is under control of the Coast Guard. This
will avoid the necessity of special acts of Congress in each of such instances.
Subsection (p) is new and is necessary to give proper authority for the maintenance of networks of wires
and cables, in some cases over or along private property or public highways. These networks are in existence
at the present time and are essential for the Service to carry out its functions.
Subsection (q) is new and is necessary in order to provide clear authority for the maintenance of radio
stations which are essential to Coast Guard functions.
Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
Based on title 5, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §41, and on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed. §§22, 58, 91, 99, 103 (R.S. 2749;
June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §§7, 8, 22 Stat. 164; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, §5, 22 Stat. 57; Mar. 4, 1907, ch. 2918, 34
Stat. 1309; Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, §1, 38 Stat. 800; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; June 10, 1921, ch. 18,
§304, 42 Stat. 23; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, §9, 44 Stat. 817).
Said section 91 has been divided. That part dealing with investigation of plans and inventions is covered in
section 93(d) of this title. The remainder is covered in general terms. It has been rewritten in broad terms,
making clear that the Commandant is granted the necessary authority to administer the Coast Guard under the
Secretary, including authority to issue rules, orders, and instructions.
This section is primarily a consolidation of existing functions rather than a codification of existing laws. It
does not, for the most part, grant new authority to the Coast Guard as an organization. It merely clarifies the
method by which Coast Guard functions shall be administered. Under existing statutes, functions relating to
the Coast Guard have been conferred upon the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Commandant,
and sometimes upon the Secretary of the Treasury in times of peace and the Secretary of the Navy in times of
war. This revision confers some functions directly upon the Coast Guard, and this section provides for the
execution of those functions by the Commandant, the military head of the organization, thereby making for
consistency and uniformity. The functions are to be executed "subject to the general supervision of the
Secretary". Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §91 now grants authority to the Commandant to prescribe regulations;
this is changed to the issuance of rules, orders, and instructions as the promulgation of regulations in a military
organization is properly a function of the Secretary.
Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

authorizes the Coast Guard to use its personnel and facilities to assist other Government agencies when
requested and, correlatively, authorizes the Coast Guard to utilize the personnel and facilities of other
agencies. It is believed desirable to have this authority spelled out by statute because in times of emergency,
for example floods, it sometimes becomes most advantageous to cooperate in this manner. 81st Congress,

§702. State Department
The Coast Guard, through the Secretary, may exchange information, through the Secretary of
State, with foreign governments and suggest to the Secretary of State international collaboration and
conferences on all matters dealing with the safety of life and property at sea, other than radio
communication.
(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 505, §142; renumbered §702, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §106(b), Dec.
4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4203.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
Because of the numerous situations in which it is necessary for the Coast Guard to deal with foreign
governments, particularly in the field of safety of life and property at sea, the Coast Guard and the State
Department agree that a provision such as this is desirable.
The international character of many Coast Guard functions makes it more and more necessary for the
Service to be an initiating or participating agency in international collaboration. Examples of international
meetings concerned with matters affecting the Coast Guard include those which dealt with the International
Rules of the Road, international load lines, the International Code of Signals, safety at sea, and international
telecommunications. It is highly desirable that there be a clear-cut legislative expression of Coast Guard
cooperation with the State Department on proposed international conferences dealing with various phases of
Coast Guard activities, such as aids to navigation, life-saving equipment, navigation and communication
equipment other than radio communication, regulation of dangerous cargoes, international rules of the road,
safety requirements and equipment of transoceanic aircraft and vessels, and safe manning standards and
efficiency of personnel employed on transoceanic aircraft and vessels. Provisions for similar relationship
between the Civil Aeronautical Board and the State Department appear in the act of June 23, 1938, as
amended, 52 Stat. 984 (title 49, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§425(c), 602). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
This section outlines the sphere of cooperation between the Weather Bureau and the Coast Guard. It would
not permit any cooperation that has not been carried on in the past.
Although the Coast Guard has always cooperated closely with the Weather Bureau, positive recognition of
this has never appeared in the statutes. In its patrol, its aiding navigation, and its life saving activities, the
Coast Guard finds it important to make, receive and transmit weather observations and measurements.
Furthermore, with the advent of war, weather reporting, particularly mid-Atlantic weather patrol work,
assumed increasing importance, and this extensive weather station manning in cooperation with the Weather
Bureau must be provided for in the postwar period. This section providing for such close cooperation with the
Weather Bureau in weather reporting would crystallize the cooperative practices of the two agencies as they
have operated for years. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §441a (May 19, 1926, ch. 334, 44 Stat. 565; May 14, 1935, ch. 109,
49 Stat. 218; Oct. 1, 1942, ch. 571, 56 Stat. 763; 1946 Proc. No. 2695, July 4, 1946, 11 F.R. 7517, 60 Stat.
1352).
Experience has indicated that it will be advantageous for the Government to include the Coast Guard along
with the other armed forces for the purpose of detailing personnel for service with foreign governments.
It seems probable that the increased collaboration with foreign governments after the war and the vital
nature of the Coast Guard's activities in relation to such collaboration will result in requests from time to time
by foreign governments for assistance which the Coast Guard is in the best position to render. This section,
which confers broad authority in the President to detail Coast Guard officers and enlisted men to assist foreign
governments, is patterned after the act of October 1, 1942, 56 Stat. 763 (title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §441–a),
which authorizes the President to detail Army, Navy, and Marine Corps officers and men to certain foreign
governments and, in times of war or national emergency, to any foreign government in the interests of
national defense. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
Experience since the war has indicated the necessity for making provision for the assignment of Coast
Guard officers to diplomatic missions in those foreign countries which are extensively engaged in maritime
commerce with the United States. This is largely the result of duties in connection with inspection of merchant
vessels.
This section authorizes the designation, with the consent of the State Department, of Coast Guard officers to
be officially attached to diplomatic missions of the United States. Although Coast Guard advice on Coast
Guard matters is always available to our diplomatic missions, in those locations where such advice and
information are frequently sought, it is felt that the most effective utilization of Coast Guard services would be
achieved by having Coast Guard officers attached to such missions. Provision for customs officers to be
attached to diplomatic missions is contained in the act of March 4, 1923, as amended, 42 Stat. 1453 (title 19,
U.S.C., 1946 ed., §6). Before the transfer in 1939 of the Foreign Agriculture Service to the State Department,
representatives of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the Department of Agriculture stationed abroad
were agricultural attachés. Act of June 5, 1930, 46 Stat. 498 (title 7, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §542(a)). 81st Congress,

This section closely parallels title 46, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§797, 798, which authorizes the Secretary of the
Navy to negotiate amicable settlement of claims against the United States arising out of the operation of Naval
vessels. It grants similar authority to the Secretary of the Treasury in relation to vessels in the Coast Guard
service, and the limiting amount is reduced from $1,000,000 to $25,000. It is believed that this section will
work to the benefit of the Government by reducing civil litigation and the number of claims which must
presently be certified to Congress for appropriations in order to make settlement. It will greatly expedite the
settlement of just claims and should result in a considerable overall savings to the Government. 81st Congress,

§938. Claims for damage to property of the United States
The Secretary may consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, or settle claims for damage
cognizable in admiralty in a district court of the United States and all claims for damage caused by a
vessel or floating object, to property of the United States under the jurisdiction of the Coast Guard or
property for which the Coast Guard may have assumed, by contract or otherwise, any obligation to
respond for damage thereto. The Secretary is further authorized to receive in payment of any such
claim the amount due the United States pursuant to determination, compromise, or settlement as
herein authorized and, upon acceptance of such payment but not until then, such determination,
settlement, or compromise of such claim shall be final and conclusive for all purposes, any law to the
contrary notwithstanding. All such payments shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States
as miscellaneous receipts. The Secretary is further authorized to execute on behalf of the United
States and to deliver in exchange for such payment a full release of such claim. This section, as
respects the determination, compromise, settlement, and payment of claims, shall be supplementary
[Release Point 118-106]
to, and not in lieu of, all other provisions of law authorizing the determination, compromise, or
settlement of claims for damage to property hereinabove described. No settlement or compromise
where there is involved a payment in the net amount of over $425,000 is authorized by this section.

This section closely parallels title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§600a, 600b, which authorize the Secretary of the
Navy to negotiate amicable settlements of affirmative claims of the United States for damage to Government
property. Experience gained by the Navy since enactment of title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§600a–600d,
indicates that such amicable settlement reacts to the benefit of the Government in many cases. The provisions
of this section would complement those of section 646 of this title and the two sections together would permit
the Coast Guard to negotiate the settlement of claims arising out of Coast Guard floating operations, both for
and against the United States. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§939. Accounting for industrial work
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary may prescribe regulations governing accounting for industrial
work, including charges for overhead for civilian labor and for maintenance of industrial plant and
equipment, performed at the Coast Guard Yard or such similar Coast Guard industrial establishments
as he may designate. Any orders placed for such industrial work shall be covered by a transfer or
advance of funds to cover the estimated cost thereof, and shall be credited to such accounts as may
be necessary and established by the Secretary to carry out the provisions of this section. Accounts so
established shall be available for materials, supplies, or equipment, and civilian labor, including
overhead and maintenance, required in performing the work ordered. Upon completion of an order
an adjustment will be made to make the amount transferred or advanced equal to the actual cost as
computed in accordance with the accounting regulations prescribed by the Secretary or in accordance
with subsection (b).
(b) INCENTIVE CONTRACTS.—
(1) The parties to an order for industrial work to be performed by the Coast Guard Yard or a
Coast Guard industrial establishment designated under subsection (a) may enter into an order or a
cost-plus-incentive-fee order in accordance with this subsection.
(2) If such parties enter into such an order or a cost-plus-incentive-fee order, an agreed-upon
[Release Point 118-106]
amount of any adjustment described in subsection (a) may be distributed as an incentive to the
wage-grade industrial employees who complete the order.
(3) Before entering into such an order or cost-plus-incentive-fee order such parties must agree
that the wage-grade employees of the Coast Guard Yard or Coast Guard industrial establishment
will take action to improve the delivery schedule or technical performance agreed to in the order
for industrial work to which such parties initially agreed.
(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the industrial workforce of the Coast Guard
Yard or Coast Guard industrial establishment satisfies the performance target established in such
an order or cost-plus-incentive-fee order—
(A) the adjustment to be made pursuant to subsection (a) shall be reduced by an agreed-upon
amount and distributed to such wage-grade industrial employees; and
(B) the remainder of the adjustment shall be credited to the appropriation for such order
current at that time.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
This section is intended to eliminate a very cumbersome and inefficient method of accounting for industrial
jobs at the Coast Guard Yard and other shore establishments where industrial work may be undertaken. Under
existing law several accounts must be kept current for each job in progress. Under this statute the working
fund would be available for all types of expenditures in connection with a job and the breakdown into separate
accounts could be done after the job is complete. The other armed forces have provisions of law which permit
a working fund similar to the one provided by this section. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

extended to include items not previously stocked, or spare parts obtained as part of a procurement
[Release Point 118-106]
under a different account of major items such as vessels or aircraft, whether or not such parts were
previously stocked, the Secretary may authorize an increase in the existing capital of the fund by the
value of such usable materials transferred thereto from Coast Guard inventories carried in other

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
This section does not change the present method of administration of the Academy. It makes statutory what
has been administrative regulation heretofore, and it is believed highly desirable to make the control of an
institution of such national interest as the Academy the subject of a statute.
This section is new. There is no provision in existing law which establishes the Academy and sets it up as
an operating unit. Nor is there any provision which creates the office of Superintendent of the Academy, or
prescribes his duties and functions. Heretofore this has been accomplished by regulations, and the laws which
deal with the Academy assume its existence as a going institution and assume the existence of the
Superintendent with certain defined functions and duties. This section continues the Academy as previously
established, provides for the appointment of the Superintendent by the Commandant, and defines in general
terms his functions. The Academy would thus be placed on a definite statutory basis, and the office of
Superintendent would be a statutory position, but the present administration of the Academy would in no way
be interfered with. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§1922. Appointments
Appointments to cadetships shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, who

the course of instruction at the Coast Guard Academy and accept an appointment as a commissioned
officer upon graduation from the Coast Guard Academy.

of the Academy, means the period beginning on the date of the officer's appointment as a
commissioned officer and ending on the sixth anniversary of such appointment or, at the discretion
of the Secretary, any later date up to the eighth anniversary of such appointment.
(e)(1) This section does not apply to a cadet who is not a citizen or national of the United States.
(2) In the case of a cadet who is a minor and who has parents or a guardian, the cadet may sign the
agreement required by subsection (a) only with the consent of the parent or guardian.
(f) A cadet or former cadet who does not fulfill the terms of the obligation to serve as specified
under section (a), or the alternative obligation imposed under subsection (b), shall be subject to the
repayment provisions of section 303a(e) of title 37.

indebted to the United States on account of advances of pay to purchase required clothing and
equipment shall be required to turn in to the Academy all clothing and equipment of a distinctively
military nature to the extent required to discharge such indebtedness; and, if the value of such

The last sentence of this section is new, being included in order to allow for adjusting the working time and
leave of civilian instructors in conformity with the academic terms at the Academy. The work load of an
instructor varies greatly, and flexibility in administration of a faculty is therefore essential. The leave provided
for civil service employees does not fit the needs of an instruction staff, and this has been a source of
difficulty in the past. This new provision would permit leave during the summer and between academic terms
without deduction from pay, and, it is contemplated, at no other time.

renumbered §1942, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §110(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4212.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§15b, 15c (Apr. 16, 1937, ch. 107, §§1, 2, 50 Stat. 66; May 2, 1942,
ch. 273, 56 Stat. 265).
Section 15b of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. Part of the provisions of the first sentence is
placed in this section, while other provisions are placed in section 188 of this title.
Section 15c of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. The last sentence is incorporated in this section,
while the other provisions are placed in section 189 of this title.
The composition of the teaching staff at the Academy is changed materially on the recommendation of the
Academic Board and the Advisory Committee. The scope of duty of members of the staff is enlarged to
include whatever the Commandant prescribes.
Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §15b provides for five professors as heads or assistant heads of departments at
the Academy. The Academic Board of the Academy and the Advisory Committee, after extensive study have
recommended the change, as provided in this section, to three professors and twelve others on the permanent
teaching staff, with designations to conform generally with the designations and grades of faculty members at
other universities. The librarian is given faculty status because of the role of the library as the center of the
modern university; this is in conformity with the practice of other higher educational institutions. It is believed
that the increased number of permanent commissioned instructors is justified and desirable in view of the
expansion of the Cadet Corps as the full effect of the return to a four-year course is felt. It is probable that, in
the next few years, the number of cadets will approximate 450. The average number in the past two years has
been about 300. This new set-up for the permanent commissioned teaching staff will permit desirable
exchanges of professors with leading universities, and occasional sabbatical leaves in order to better the
faculty generally. It is pointed out that this increase in permanent instructors does not increase the authorized
number of officers in the Coast Guard, as they are all included in the limitation provided in section 42 of this
title. If a teaching position at the Academy is not provided for permanently it will require the assignment of an
additional regular officer, so it is apparent that the changes proposed in this section do not increase the size of
the Service, or the expense, but represent a long-range plan to better the Academy as a leading educational
institution within the present, recognized, standards for a proper university faculty. The last sentence retains
the command status of the professors as provided in existing law but enlarges the field in which they may
[Release Point 118-106]
perform duty, in order to make it possible to give them interim assignments other than at the Academy, thus
broadening their knowledge of the Service while still advantageously utilizing their services. 81st Congress,

Said section has been divided. That part of the first sentence which provides for the composition of the
teaching staff is incorporated in section 187 of this title. The other provisions are incorporated in this section,
except for the proviso which has been omitted as no longer needed.
This section incorporates the following changes because of the new plan for the permanent teaching staff:
the President is authorized to appoint a candidate to any of the grades prescribed; and the probationary term,
applicable unless the candidate has served in the Coast Guard as prescribed in this section, is increased from
two to four years. Authorization for appointment in any grade is deemed desirable in order to permit the
acquisition of outstanding instructors for the staff. It is believed that the former two-year period was too short
to fully evaluate the capabilities of a temporary appointee. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§1945. Retirement of permanent commissioned teaching staff
Professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and instructors in the Coast Guard shall be
subject to retirement or discharge from active service for any cause on the same basis as other
commissioned officers of the Coast Guard, except that they shall not be required to retire from active
service under the provisions of section 2149 of this title, nor shall they be subject to the provisions of
section 2150 of this title, nor shall they be required to retire at age sixty-two but may be permitted to
serve until age sixty-four at which time unless earlier retired or separated they shall be retired. The
Secretary may retire any member of the permanent commissioned teaching staff who has completed
thirty years' active service. Service as a civilian member of the teaching staff at the Academy in
addition to creditable service authorized by any other law in any of the military services rendered
prior to an appointment as a professor, associate professor, assistant professor, or instructor shall be
credited in computing length of service for retirement purposes. The provisions of law relating to
retirement for disability in line of duty shall not apply in the case of a professor, associate professor,
assistant professor, or instructor serving under a temporary appointment.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §15f (Apr. 16, 1937, ch. 107, §5, 50 Stat. 67).
The provision prohibiting the retirement of a professor because of physical disability with less than 15
years' service is changed to have application only during the temporary appointment of a professor.
This section provides for the retirement of associate professors, assistant professors, and commissioned
instructors in addition to professors. It is believed that the provision of existing law requiring 15 years' service
before becoming eligible for retirement, discriminated against this group of officers as no other group was
discriminated against, and should be eliminated. It was changed so that these officers would be ineligible for
retirement during their probationary term only.

five members, or at least two-thirds of the members of a board composed of more than five
members.
(2) The Secretary shall conduct a survey of the Coast Guard officer corps to determine if

not make any recommendation under this subsection before the date on which the Secretary
publishes a finding, based upon the results of the survey, that implementation of this subsection will
improve Coast Guard officer retention.
(3) The Secretary shall submit any finding made by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2) to the

"(a) Officers who have been placed permanently out of line of promotion under laws and regulations of the

(A) an officer or former officer was not considered for selection for promotion by a selection
board convened under section 2106; or
(B) the name of an officer or former officer was not placed on an all-fully-qualified-officers
list;
the Secretary shall convene a special selection board to determine whether such officer or former
officer should be recommended for promotion and such officer or former officer shall not be
considered to have failed of selection for promotion prior to the consideration of the special
selection board.
(2) EFFECT OF FAILURE TO RECOMMEND FOR PROMOTION.—If a special selection
board convened under paragraph (1) does not recommend for promotion an officer or former
officer, whose grade is below the grade of captain and whose name was referred to that board for
consideration, the officer or former officer shall be considered to have failed of selection for
promotion.
(b) OFFICERS CONSIDERED BUT NOT SELECTED; MATERIAL ERROR.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—In the case of an officer or former officer who was eligible for promotion,
was considered for selection for promotion by a selection board convened under section 2106, and
was not selected for promotion by that board, the Secretary may convene a special selection board
to determine whether the officer or former officer should be recommended for promotion, if the
Secretary determines that—
[Release Point 118-106]
(A) an action of the selection board that considered the officer or former officer—
(i) was contrary to law in a matter material to the decision of the board; or
(ii) involved material error of fact or material administrative error; or
(B) the selection board that considered the officer or former officer did not have before it for
consideration material information.
(2) EFFECT OF FAILURE TO RECOMMEND FOR PROMOTION.—If a special selection
board convened under paragraph (1) does not recommend for promotion an officer or former
officer, whose grade is that of commander or below and whose name was referred to that board for
consideration, the officer or former officer shall be considered—
(A) to have failed of selection for promotion with respect to the board that considered the
officer or former officer prior to the consideration of the special selection board; and
(B) to incur no additional failure of selection for promotion as a result of the action of the
special selection board.
(c) REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIAL SELECTION BOARDS.—Each special selection board
convened under this section shall—
(1) be composed in accordance with section 2107 and the members of the board shall be
required to swear the oaths described in section 2109;
(2) consider the record of an applicable officer or former officer as that record, if corrected,
would have appeared to the selection board that should have considered or did consider the officer
or former officer prior to the consideration of the special selection board and that record shall be
compared with a sampling of the records of—
(A) those officers of the same grade who were recommended for promotion by such prior
selection board; and
(B) those officers of the same grade who were not recommended for promotion by such prior
selection board; and
(3) submit to the Secretary a written report in a manner consistent with sections 2117 and 2118.
(d) APPOINTMENT OF OFFICERS RECOMMENDED FOR PROMOTION.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—An officer or former officer whose name is placed on a promotion list as a
result of the recommendation of a special selection board convened under this section shall be
appointed, as soon as practicable, to the next higher grade in accordance with the law and policies
that would have been applicable to the officer or former officer had the officer or former officer
been recommended for promotion by the selection board that should have considered or did
consider the officer or former officer prior to the consideration of the special selection board.
(2) EFFECT.—An officer or former officer who is promoted to the next higher grade as a result
of the recommendation of a special selection board convened under this section shall have, upon
such promotion, the same date of rank, the same effective date for the pay and allowances of that
grade, and the same position on the active duty promotion list as the officer or former officer
would have had if the officer or former officer had been recommended for promotion to that grade
by the selection board that should have considered or did consider the officer or former officer
prior to the consideration of the special selection board.
(3) RECORD CORRECTION.—If the report of a special selection board convened under this
section, as approved by the President, recommends for promotion to the next higher grade an
officer not eligible for promotion or a former officer whose name was referred to the board for
consideration, the Secretary may act under section 1552 of title 10 to correct the military record of
the officer or former officer to correct an error or remove an injustice resulting from the officer or
former officer not being selected for promotion by the selection board that should have considered
or did consider the officer or former officer prior to the consideration of the special selection
board.
[Release Point 118-106]
(e) APPLICATION PROCESS AND TIME LIMITS.—The Secretary shall issue regulations
regarding the process by which an officer or former officer may apply to have a matter considered by
a special selection board convened under this section, including time limits related to such

(f) LIMITATION OF OTHER JURISDICTION.—No official or court of the United States shall
have authority or jurisdiction over any claim based in any way on the failure of an officer or former
officer to be selected for promotion by a selection board convened under section 2106, until—
(1) the claim has been referred to a special selection board convened under this section and
acted upon by that board; or
(2) the claim has been rejected by the Secretary without consideration by a special selection
board convened under this section.
(g) JUDICIAL REVIEW.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—A court of the United States may review—
(A) a decision of the Secretary not to convene a special selection board under this section to
determine if the court finds that the decision of the Secretary was arbitrary or capricious, not
based on substantial evidence, or otherwise contrary to law; and
(B) an action of a special selection board under this section to determine if the court finds that
the action of the special selection board was contrary to law or involved material error of fact or
material administrative error.
(2) REMAND AND RECONSIDERATION.—If, with respect to a review under paragraph (1),
a court makes a finding described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of that paragraph, the court shall
remand the case to the Secretary and the Secretary shall provide the applicable officer or former
officer consideration by a new special selection board convened under this section.

years of active commissioned service, but not more than twelve, by two months' basic pay of the grade in
which he is serving on the date of his discharge. In determining the total number of years of active service to
be used as a multiplier in computing this payment, a part of a year that is six months or more is counted as a
whole year and a part of a year that is less than six months is disregarded. The acceptance of a lump-sum
payment under this section does not deprive a person of any retirement benefits from the United States.
However, there shall be deducted from each of his retirement payments so much thereof as is based on the
service for which he has received payment under this section until the total amount deducted equals the

30 of the promotion year in which the report of the continuation board convened under this section is
approved, or the last day of the month in which he completes twenty years of active service,
whichever is later.

action retain on active duty from promotion year to promotion year any officer who would otherwise
be retired under subsection (g) or section 2149 of this title. An officer so retained, unless retired

Certain additional details concerning the two types of enlistments are added; these details were previously

This section makes provision for the enlistment of personnel in the Coast Guard. The first sentence grants
the necessary authority to the Secretary, changes existing law in regard to the term of enlistment from "not to
exceed four years" to "not to exceed six years", and adds a provision for the enlistment of minors for their
minority only, such provision being in accordance with existing law applicable to the Navy. The next three
sentences establish and define the two types of enlistments that are now in effect in the Coast Guard, setting
forth the basic difference in the two types. The last sentence continues a provision to the effect that original
enlistments in the Coast Guard shall be temporary. This section is a combination of existing law and
regulations in regard to enlistments, with changes as noted above. See title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §35, and

Said sections have application to officers only, but in accord with the general plan to make as many
provisions as possible applicable both to officers and men, it seems highly desirable to provide similarly for
enlisted men—a fortiori because there are cases in the Coast Guard in which enlisted men are suffering
inequitably because there is no provision for advancing men on the retired list after they have been advanced
in rating while serving on active duty after recall from the retired list. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

performance of duty was satisfactory.
(c) RETIREMENT IN LOWER GRADE.—

shall be resolved following a conditional determination under subsection (a)(2) if the investigation
of or personnel action against the commissioned officer results in adverse findings.

§2502. Retirement
(a) Every commissioned officer, warrant officer, or enlisted member who is retired under any
provisions of this title shall be retired with the permanent grade or rate held at the time of retirement,
unless entitled to retire with a higher grade or rate under any provision of this title or any other law.

shall be lieutenant (junior grade).
(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 524, §421; Pub. L. 97–417, §2(10), Jan. 4, 1983, 96 Stat. 2086; Pub.

§2502, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §114(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4223.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
Subsection (a) is new in this form, but the provision contained therein is expressed or implied in numerous
statutes relating to the retirement of military personnel.
A provision defining the next higher grade to that of commissioned warrant officer as lieutenant (junior
grade), for purposes of retirement, was added.
The other provisions of said section are obsolete and are no longer needed.
Subsection (a) is new, but the provision contained in it is expressed or implied in numerous statutes relating
to retirement of military personnel. It is believed desirable to include such a provision to prevent any
misconstruction of retirement statutes, even though no change in existing law is intended on the point covered,
either by other sections dealing with retirement or by this section.
Subsection (b) is a codification of the only provision of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §174, that it is desired to
retain, and in addition designated the next higher grade for commissioned warrant officers as lieutenant (junior
grade) because the pay of the commissioned warrant officers is the same as for the grade of lieutenant (junior
grade) and advancing such officers to the grade of ensign would in some aspects not appear to be a promotion.

[Release Point 118-106]
"(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 23, 2022], and
annually thereafter, the Commandant [of the Coast Guard] shall submit to the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the
House of Representatives a report that evaluates resignation and retirement processing timelines.
"(b) ELEMENTS.—The report required under subsection (a) shall include, for the preceding calendar

"(1) statistics on the number of resignations, retirements, and other separations that occurred;
"(2) the processing time for each action described in paragraph (1);
"(3) the percentage of requests for such actions that had a command endorsement;

§2503. Status of recalled personnel
All retired personnel when recalled to active duty shall serve in the grade or rate in which they
were serving at the time of retirement.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
This provision is desirable because many enlisted men and low-ranking officers may now retire with higher
grade which they previously held on a temporary basis. If recalled in the higher grades, they might not be
capable of holding same at the time of recall. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

(a)(1) The retired pay of a member who first became a member of a uniformed service (as defined
in section 101 of title 10) before September 8, 1980, is determined by multiplying—
(A) the sum of—
(i) the basic pay of the member's retired grade or rate, and
(ii) all permanent additions thereto including longevity credit to which the member was
entitled at the time of retirement; by
(B) the retired pay multiplier determined under section 1409 of title 10 for the number of years
of service that may be credited to the member under section 1405 of such title.
(2) In the case of an officer who served as Commandant, retired pay under paragraph (1) shall be
computed at the highest rate of basic pay applicable to the officer while so serving.
(3) In the case of an enlisted member who served as the master chief petty officer of the Coast
Guard, retired pay under paragraph (1) shall be computed at the highest rate of basic pay to which
the member was entitled while so serving, if that basic pay is greater than the basic pay of the grade
or rate to which the member is otherwise entitled at the time of retirement.
(4) In the case of an officer whose retired pay is computed on the pay of a grade for which basic
pay is not based upon years of service, retired pay under paragraph (1) shall be computed on the
[Release Point 118-106]
basis of the number of years of service for which the officer would be entitled to credit in the
computation of pay on the active list had the officer been serving in the grade of captain at the time
of retirement.
(b) The retired pay of a member who first became a member of a uniformed service (as defined in
section 101 of title 10) on or after September 8, 1980, is determined by multiplying—
(1) the retired pay base determined under section 1407 of title 10; by
(2) the retired pay multiplier determined under section 1409 of title 10 for the number of years
of service that may be credited to the member under section 1405 of such title.
(c)(1) In computing for the purpose of subsection (a) or (b) the number of years of service that
may be credited to a member under section 1405 of title 10—
(A) each full month of service that is in addition to the number of full years of service creditable
to the member shall be counted as 1/12 of a year; and
(B) any remaining fractional part of a month shall be disregarded.
(2) Retired pay computed under this section, if not a multiple of $1, shall be rounded to the next
lower multiple of $1.
(d) In addition to amounts computed pursuant to subsections (a) through (c) of this section, a full
TSP member (as defined in section 8440e(a) of title 5) of the Coast Guard is entitled to continuation
pay pursuant to section 356 of title 37.

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §15k (Apr. 20, 1939, ch. 75, 53 Stat. 582).
The limitation on the amount for such contingencies is increased, and the amount is made available to the
Commandant rather than solely to the Superintendent of the Academy as now prescribed by law. The
authorization is to cover expenditures incident to the offices of the Commandant and the Superintendent of the
Academy. The intent is that the amount authorized will be administered in a manner similar to that now
employed by the Superintendent of the Academy under the authority of 14 U.S.C., §15k. 81st Congress,

Because of the wide variety of tasks assigned to Coast Guard personnel it is deemed advisable to broaden
this authority to the more general language as rewritten, insofar as Coast Guard personnel are concerned, thus
giving complete authority to protect their health.
Said section would in no way be affected.

Guard.
Subsection (b) is new to the Coast Guard, although it has been the practice for retired officers to wear the

Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §30 (Jan. 12, 1919, ch. 8, 40 Stat. 1054). Said section
was changed to have application to the Coast Guard at all times, rather than when the Coast Guard is operating
with the Navy.
Inasmuch as the act cited above applies equally to the Navy and Marine Corps as well as the Coast Guard, it
is not scheduled for repeal but is being amended by section 9 of this act to eliminate reference to the Coast
Guard.
Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946, ed., §13, and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §754 (July 1,
1898, ch. 346, §1, 30 Stat. 604; July 27, 1912, ch. 255, §2, 37 Stat. 239). Said section 13 was changed to have
application to all enlisted personnel rather than to "crews of vessels in service" only. The provision of said
section 754 which provided for the sale of clothing to civilian employees is eliminated as becoming obsolete.
Subsection (c) is new. Title 37, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §110 authorizes the payment of a cash allowance in case
clothing is not furnished to enlisted persons of the Coast Guard. Clearly this presumes the authority to issue
clothing to enlisted persons; this section makes the authority statutory. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §147 (May 26, 1906, ch. 2556, §5, 34 Stat. 200).
Said section has been divided. That part relating to rewards for the apprehension of deserters is placed in
this section. That part relating to the acceptance of convicted deserters in the armed forces is placed in section
575 of this title. The first sentence of said section is eliminated inasmuch as it is believed that commanding
officers in the Coast Guard are charged with the duty of apprehending deserters without special statutory
authority therefor.
The limitation as to amount that could be offered is removed.
The provision concerning money due the deserter is eliminated. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§2744. Life-saving medals
(a) The Secretary may, under regulations prescribed by him, award a Life-saving medal of gold or
silver to any individual, including personnel of the Coast Guard, who rescues or endeavors to rescue
any other individual from drowning, shipwreck, or other peril of the water in accordance with the
following provisions:
(1) if such rescue or attempted rescue is made at the risk of one's own life and evidences
extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold;
(2) if such rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of
gold, but evidences the exercise of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be
of silver.
(b) In order for an individual to be eligible for the Life-saving Medals the rescue or attempted
rescue must take place in waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or if
the rescue or attempted rescue takes place outside such waters, one or the other of the parties must be
a citizen of the United States or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the United
States.
(c) No individual shall receive more than one gold medal and one silver medal; but any individual
who has received or may hereafter receive a gold or silver medal and who again performs an act
which would entitle him to receive another medal of the same class may be awarded, in lieu of a
second medal of the same class, a gold or silver bar, as the case may be, to be worn with the medal
already bestowed, and for every such additional act, an additional bar may be awarded. Medals and
bars in lieu thereof, authorized by this subsection, may be awarded posthumously.

div. G, title LVXXXV [LXXXV], §8505(a)(36), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4749.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§193, 194, 195, 196 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, §7, 18 Stat. 127; June 18,
1878, ch. 265, §12, 20 Stat. 165; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, §9, 22 Stat. 57; Jan. 21, 1897, ch. 83, 29 Stat. 494).
Said sections have been rewritten so as to make the awarding of Life-saving medals turn on whether or not
the United States has an interest in the heroic act, rather than on technical jurisdictional grounds. Under
existing law the award of a medal could be made in any case in which the rescuer or the rescued was a citizen
of the United States, or was from a vessel owned or operated by the United States regardless of where the
rescue took place; and if the rescue took place within waters of the United States the award could be made to
an alien.
The existing law relating to the Treasury Department Life-Saving Medal contained in title 14, U.S.C., 1946,
ed., §§192–196, has long needed revision. The existing law is composed of a series of statutes enacted
separately between 1874 and 1897, and the result has not been entirely unsatisfactory. The original statute,
enacted in 1874 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §193), provided for Life-saving medals of the first and second
class to be bestowed "upon any persons who shall hereafter endanger their own lives in saving, or endeavoring
to save lives from the perils of the sea, within the United States, or upon any American vessel". The medal of
[Release Point 118-106]
the first class was confined to cases of "extreme and heroic daring" and the medal of the second class was to
be awarded "in cases not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of the first class" Then in 1878
another act was passed (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §194) authorizing the bestowal of the medal of the second
class "upon persons making such signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked, and saving
persons from drowning" as, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, merited recognition. These two
sections were construed by the Attorney General to be limited to the rescue of persons who were subjected to
the perils of the sea in any waters of the United States in the vicinity of any lifeboat station, life-saving station,
or house of refuge. And the person upon whom the medal could be bestowed was limited to members of
life-saving crews. (1895) Op. Att. Gen. 124. Thereupon, in 1897, an act was passed which provided that the
two earlier acts should "be construed so as to empower the Secretary of the Treasury to bestow such medals
upon persons making signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked and saving persons from
drowning in waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, whether the said persons making such
exertions were or were not members of the Life-Saving Service or whether or not such exertions were made in
the vicinity of a life-saving station". (Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §196.) This act was designed to give a more
liberal application to the two earlier acts, and all three were to be read as one. (1900) 23 Op. Atty. Gen. 78.
However, difficult questions of interpretation have arisen because of the different jurisdictional language in
the three acts. For example, title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §193, refers to rescues "within the United States", while
title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §196, refers to rescues "in the waters over which the United States has jurisdiction".
The need for clarification is obvious. Subsection (a) authorizes the awarding of the medal to any person,
including Coast Guard personnel, who rescues or endeavors to rescue any person from drowning, shipwreck,
or peril of the water. If the rescue or attempted rescue is at the risk of one's own life and evidences extreme
and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold, and if the rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently
distinguished to deserve the gold medal, but evidences the exertion of such signal exertion as to merit
recognition, the medal shall be of silver. Thus, the acts for which the medals are to be awarded are defined
simply and without any geographical or jurisdictional limitations. The difficulty with the existing law is the
attempt to define the required deed together with those limitations. Subsection (a) does not change existing
law insofar as the type of act necessary for the medals is concerned; it merely simplifies and clarifies existing
law.
Subsection (b) contains the jurisdictional limitations on the awarding of the medal and broadens, to a
considerable extent, the provisions of existing law. It is the intent of this subsection to authorize the awarding
of a medal in all cases where the United States has a legitimate interest in recognizing meritorious acts, such
as where a United States citizen performs the act, or where a United States citizen is rescued, or where United
States waters or United States vessels or aircraft are involved. Accordingly, rescues by United States citizens
anywhere in the world will be recognized. Any person, including persons not citizens of the United States,
may receive medals if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place in waters within the United States or subject
to its jurisdiction or, in cases of rescues outside such waters, if either the rescuer or the person rescued is from
a United States vessel or aircraft, or the person rescued is a United States citizen. Thus, every case in which
the United States government has an interest is provided for. A United States citizen who performs a heroic
act sufficient to justify a medal in state waters, or in foreign waters, could not receive one under existing law,
but could receive such award under this proposed revision. The awarding of medals should not turn on
technical jurisdictional grounds; it should turn rather on the interest of the United States to recognize noble
and heroic acts.
Subsection (c) dealing with the awarding of bars for additional acts, clarifies, but does not change title 14,
U.S.C., 1946 ed., §195, except that authority is granted to award medals posthumously. 81st Congress, House
Report No. 557.

The Secretary may have remitted or cancelled any part of an individual's indebtedness to the
United States or any instrumentality of the United States if—
(1) the indebtedness was incurred while the individual served as a member of the Coast Guard,
whether as a regular or a reserve in active status; and

§8505(a)(40), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4750.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§20a, 121 (May 18, 1920, ch. 190, §8, 41 Stat. 603; June 10, 1922, ch.
212, 42 Stat. 625; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, §10, 44 Stat. 817).
Said section 121 was omitted from the 1940 and 1946 editions of the U.S. Code, but it has been held that
the assimilation provision thereof is inoperative only insofar as Congress has made specific legislative
provision for the Coast Guard, and that benefits derived from legislation pertaining to the Navy previously
conferred upon the Coast Guard, and not provided for in subsequent legislation, survive to the Coast Guard
under the assimilation statute. (See 27 Comp. Dec. 234; 22 Comp. Gen. 723; decision of June 9, 1947,
B–63472; decision of April 2, 1948, B–70438; and decision of September 2, 1948, B–77295.)
It seems desirable to retain this assimilation provision as to pay in order to cover any failure to provide
specifically for the Coast Guard in military pay legislation.
This section assimilates the pay of military personnel of the Coast Guard to the pay of military personnel of
the Navy. It seems that this is the most feasible method of insuring that the pay of military personnel of the
Coast Guard will not vary from the pay of military personnel of the other armed forces. The assimilation is
intended to include authorization for extra pay and allowances as provided for personnel of the Navy, for all
types of special duty: for example, qualified divers on diving duty, military personnel assigned to submarine
duty, military personnel assigned to aviation duty, officers assigned as aides to flag officers, and enlisted
persons assigned to duty in the mess detail. Military pay acts are intended to include Coast Guard personnel
specifically; this section would cover any failure to so provide for Coast Guard personnel in a pay act.
Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

for purposes of codification, the repeal has been executed to former subsecs. (a) and (b) of this section, which
provided respectively for the awarding of the same pay and allowances as prescribed for corresponding ranks,
grades, or ratings for personnel of the Navy and for the withholding of pay of officers on account of
indebtedness to the United States, since this appears to have been the intent of Congress.

United States from section catchline and struck out letter designation "(c)" from beginning of former subsec.

§2943. Leasing and hiring of quarters; rental of inadequate housing
(a) The Secretary is authorized to lease housing facilities at or near Coast Guard installations,
wherever located, for assignment as public quarters to military personnel and their dependents, if
any, without rental charge upon a determination by the Secretary, or his designee, that there is a lack
of adequate housing facilities at or near such Coast Guard installations. The Secretary is also
authorized to lease housing facilities for assignment as public quarters, without rental charge, to
military personnel who are on sea duty or duty at remote offshore Coast Guard stations and who do
not have dependents. Such authority shall be effective in any fiscal year only to such extent or in
such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts. When any such lease involves housing facilities
in a foreign country, the lease may be made on a multiyear basis for a period not to exceed five
years, and, in accordance with local custom and practice, advance payment may be made for the
lease. Such public housing facilities may be leased on an individual or multiple-unit basis.
Expenditures for the rental of such housing facilities may not exceed the average authorized for the
Department of Defense in any year except where the Secretary finds that the average is so low as to
prevent rental of necessary housing facilities in some areas, in which event he is authorized to
reallocate existing funds to high-cost areas so that rental expenditures in such areas exceed the
average authorized for the Department of Defense.
(b) The Secretary is authorized, subject to regulations approved by the President—
(1) to designate as rental housing such housing as he may determine to be inadequate as public
quarters; and
(2) to lease inadequate housing to members of the Coast Guard for occupancy by them and their
dependents.
(c) Where sufficient quarters are not possessed by the United States, the Commandant may hire
quarters for personnel, including personnel on sea duty at such times as they may be deprived of
their quarters on board ship due to repairs or other conditions which may render them uninhabitable.
Such accommodations shall not be available for occupancy by the dependents of such personnel.

(a) If a temporary member of the Reserve is physically injured, or dies as a result of physical
injury, and the injury is incurred incident to service while performing active duty, or engaged in
authorized travel to or from that duty, the law authorizing compensation for employees of the United
States suffering injuries while in the performance of their duties, applies, subject to this section. That
[Release Point 118-106]
law shall be administered by the Secretary of Labor to the same extent as if the member was a civil
employee of the United States and was injured in the performance of that duty. For benefit
computation, regardless of pay or pay status, the member is considered to have had monthly pay of
the monthly equivalent of the minimum rate of basic pay in effect for grade GS–9 of the General
Schedule on the date the injury is incurred.
(b) This section does not apply if the workmen's compensation law of a State, a territory, or
another jurisdiction provides coverage because of a concurrent employment status of the temporary
member. When the temporary member or a dependent is entitled to a benefit under this section and
also to a concurrent benefit from the United States on account of the same disability or death, the
temporary member or dependent, as appropriate, shall elect which benefit to receive.
(c) If a claim is filed under this section with the Secretary of Labor for benefits because of an
alleged injury or death, the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Commandant who shall direct an
investigation into the facts surrounding the alleged injury or death. The Commandant shall then
certify to the Secretary of Labor whether or not the injured or deceased individual was a temporary
member of the Reserve, the individual's military status, and whether or not the injury or death was
incurred incident to military service.
(d) A temporary member of the Reserve, who incurs a physical disability or contracts sickness or
disease while performing a duty to which the member has been assigned by competent authority, is
entitled to the same hospital treatment afforded a member of the Regular Coast Guard.
(e) In administering section 8133 of title 5, for an individual covered by this section—
(1) the percentages applicable to payments under that section are—
(A) 45 percent under subsection (a)(2) of that section, where the member died fully or
currently insured under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.), with no
additional payments for a child or children so long as the widow or widower remains eligible
for payments under that subsection;
(B) 20 percent under subsection (a)(3) of that section, for one child, and 10 percent additional
for each additional child, not to exceed a total of 75 percent, where the member died fully or
currently insured under title II of the Social Security Act; and
(C) 25 percent under subsection (a)(4) of that section, if one parent was wholly dependent for
support upon the deceased member at the time of the member's death and the other was not
dependent to any extent; 16 percent to each if both were wholly dependent; and if one was, or
both were, partly dependent, a proportionate amount in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor;
(2) payments may not be made under subsection (a)(5) of that section; and
(3) the Secretary of Labor shall inform the Commissioner of Social Security whenever a claim
is filed and eligibility for compensation is established under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of section
8133 of title 5. The Commissioner of Social Security shall then certify to the Secretary of Labor
whether or not the member concerned was fully or currently insured under title II of the Social
Security Act at the time of the member's death.

§3710. Reserve student pre-commissioning assistance program
(a) The Secretary may provide financial assistance to an eligible enlisted member of the Coast
Guard Reserve, not on active duty, for expenses of the member while the member is pursuing on a
full-time basis at an institution of higher education a program of education approved by the Secretary
that leads to—
(1) a baccalaureate degree in not more than 5 academic years; or

Guard Reserve shall—
(A) be enrolled on a full-time basis in a program of education referred to in subsection (a) at
any institution of higher education; and
(B) enter into a written agreement with the Coast Guard described in paragraph (2).
(2) A written agreement referred to in paragraph (1)(B) is an agreement between the member and
the Secretary in which the member agrees—
(A) to accept an appointment as a commissioned officer in the Coast Guard Reserve, if
tendered;
[Release Point 118-106]
(B) to serve on active duty for up to five years; and
(C) under such terms and conditions as shall be prescribed by the Secretary, to serve in the
Coast Guard Reserve until the eighth anniversary of the date of the appointment.
(c) Expenses for which financial assistance may be provided under this section are the following:
(1) Tuition and fees charged by the institution of higher education involved.
(2) The cost of books.
(3) In the case of a program of education leading to a baccalaureate degree, laboratory expenses.
(4) Such other expenses as are deemed appropriate by the Secretary.
(d) The amount of financial assistance provided to a member under this section shall be prescribed
by the Secretary, but may not exceed $25,000 for any academic year.
(e) Financial assistance may be provided to a member under this section for up to 5 consecutive
academic years.
(f) A member who receives financial assistance under this section may be ordered to active duty in
the Coast Guard Reserve by the Secretary to serve in a designated enlisted grade for such period as
the Secretary prescribes, but not more than 4 years, if the member—
(1) completes the academic requirements of the program and refuses to accept an appointment
as a commissioned officer in the Coast Guard Reserve when offered;
(2) fails to complete the academic requirements of the institution of higher education involved;
or
(3) fails to maintain eligibility for an original appointment as a commissioned officer.
(g)(1) If a member requests to be released from the program and the request is accepted by the
Secretary, or if the member fails because of misconduct to complete the period of active duty
specified, or if the member fails to fulfill any term or condition of the written agreement required to
be eligible for financial assistance under this section, the financial assistance shall be terminated. The
Secretary may request the member to reimburse the United States in an amount that bears the same

duty bears to the total period of active duty the member agreed to serve. The Secretary shall have the
option to order such reimbursement without first ordering the member to active duty. An obligation
to reimburse the United States imposed under this paragraph is a debt owed to the United States.

unqualified to serve on active duty due to a circumstance not within the control of that member or
who is not physically qualified for appointment and who is determined to be unqualified for service

not the result of the member's own misconduct or grossly negligent conduct.

of a written agreement entered into under subsection (b) does not discharge the individual signing the
agreement from a debt arising under such agreement or under paragraph (1).

term in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001).

1 So in original. Probably should be "section 3757(b)".
§3735. Authorized number of officers
(a) The authorized number of officers in the Reserve in an active status is 5,000. Reserve officers
on an active-duty list shall not be counted as part of the authorized number of officers in the Reserve.
The actual number of Reserve officers in an active status at any time shall not exceed the authorized
number unless the Secretary determines that a greater number is necessary for planned mobilization
requirements, or unless the excess results directly from the operation of law.
(b)(1) The Secretary shall make, at least once each year, a computation to determine the number of
Reserve officers in an active status authorized to be serving in each grade. The number in each grade
shall be computed by applying the applicable percentage to the total number of such officers serving
in an active status on the date the computation is made. The number of Reserve officers in an active
status below the grade of rear admiral (lower half) shall be distributed by pay grade so as not to
exceed percentages of commissioned officers authorized by section 2103(b) of this title. When the
actual number of Reserve officers in an active status in a particular pay grade is less than the
maximum percentage authorized, the difference may be applied to the number in the next lower
grade. A Reserve officer may not be reduced in rank or grade solely because of a reduction in an
authorized number as provided for in this subsection, or because an excess results directly from the
operation of law.
(2) The authorized number of Reserve Officers in an active status not on active duty in the grades
of rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral is a total of two. However, the Secretary of the
department in which the Coast Guard is operating may authorize an additional number of Reserve
officers not on active duty in the grades of rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral as necessary in
order to meet planned mobilization requirements.
(c) DEFERRAL OF LIMITATION.—If at the end of any fiscal year there is in effect a declaration
of war or national emergency, the President may defer the effectiveness of any end-strength
limitation with respect to that fiscal year prescribed by law for any military or civilian component of
[Release Point 118-106]
the Coast Guard Reserve, for a period not to exceed 6 months after the end of the war or termination
of the national emergency.

with officers of the same grade on the active duty promotion list and the permanent commissioned
teaching staff in accordance with their dates of rank. When Reserve officers and officers on the
active duty promotion list or the permanent commissioned teaching staff have the same date of rank
in a grade, they take precedence as determined by the Secretary.
(b) Notwithstanding any other law, a Reserve officer shall not lose precedence when transferred to
or from the active duty promotion list, nor shall that officer's date of rank be changed due to the
transfer.
(c) A Reserve officer shall, when on the active duty promotion list, be promoted in the same
manner as any other officer on the active duty promotion list regardless of the length of active duty
service of the Reserve officer.
(d) Notwithstanding any other law, a Reserve officer shall not lose precedence by reason of
promotion to the grade of rear admiral or rear admiral (lower half), if the promotion is determined in
accordance with a running mate system.
(e) The Secretary shall adjust the date of rank of a Reserve officer so that no changes of
precedence occur.

§3737. Running mates
(a) The Secretary shall assign a running mate to each Reserve officer in an active status not on the
active duty promotion list. The officer initially assigned as a running mate under this section shall be
that officer on the active duty promotion list of the same grade who is next senior in precedence to
the Reserve officer concerned. An officer who has twice failed of selection or who has been
considered but has not been recommended for continuation under section 2150 of this title shall not
be assigned as a running mate under this section.
(b) A Reserve officer in an active status not on the active duty promotion list shall be assigned a
new running mate as follows:
(1) If a previously assigned running mate is promoted from below the promotion zone, is
removed from the active duty promotion list, suffers a loss of numbers, fails of selection, fails to
qualify for promotion, or declines an appointment after being selected for promotion, the new
running mate shall be that officer on the active duty promotion list, of the same grade, who is next
senior to the previous running mate and who is, or may become, eligible for consideration for
promotion. If the previous running mate was on a list of selectees for promotion, the new running
mate shall be that officer on the active duty promotion list, of the same grade, who is on a list of
selectees for promotion and who is next senior to the previous running mate.
(2) If a Reserve officer suffers a loss of numbers, the new running mate shall be that officer on
the active duty promotion list who, after the loss of numbers has been effected, is the running mate
of the Reserve officer next senior to the Reserve officer concerned.
(3) If a Reserve officer is considered for promotion and fails of selection, fails to qualify for
promotion, declines an appointment after being selected for promotion, or has his or her name
removed from a list of selectees for promotion, and that officer's running mate is promoted, the
new running mate shall be that officer on the active duty promotion list, of the same grade, who, at
the time the previous running mate was considered for promotion, was next senior to the previous
running mate, was eligible for consideration for promotion, and whose name was not included on
a list of selectees for promotion.
(4) In a situation not expressly covered by this subsection, the Secretary may assign a new
running mate as necessary to effect the intent of this section that inequitable changes of
precedence do not occur.
(c) A Reserve officer on the active duty promotion list shall, to the extent practicable and
consistent with the limitations imposed by this section, be assigned as the running mate of all
Reserve officers junior to the officer, who are in an active status not on the active duty promotion
list, and who had a running mate in common with the officer just prior to the time the officer was
placed on the active duty promotion list.
(d) The Secretary may adjust, as necessary, the date of rank of a Reserve officer not on active duty
so that the date will correspond with that of the running mate assigned to the officer in accordance

for promotion to the next higher grade. A board may be convened to consider officers in one or more
grades.
(c) A selection board shall, from among the names of those eligible Reserve officers submitted to
it, recommend for promotion to the next higher grade:
(1) those officers serving in the grade of lieutenant (junior grade) or above whom it considers to
be best qualified; and
(2) those officers serving in the grade of ensign whom it considers to be fully qualified.
(d)(1) Before convening a selection board to recommend Reserve officers for promotion, the
Secretary shall establish a promotion zone for officers serving in each grade to be considered by the
board. The Secretary shall determine the number of officers in the promotion zone for officers
serving in any grade from among officers who are eligible for promotion in that grade.
(2)(A) Before convening a selection board to recommend Reserve officers for promotion to a
grade (other than the grade of lieutenant (junior grade)), the Secretary shall determine the maximum
number of officers in that grade that the board may recommend for promotion.
(B) The Secretary shall make the determination under subparagraph (A) of the maximum number
that may be recommended with a view to having in an active status a sufficient number of Reserve
officers in each grade to meet the needs of the Coast Guard for Reserve officers in an active status.
(C) In order to make the determination under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall determine the
following:
[Release Point 118-106]
(i) The number of positions needed to accomplish mission objectives that require officers in the
grade to which the board will recommend officers for promotion.
(ii) The estimated number of officers needed to fill vacancies in such positions during the period
in which it is anticipated that officers selected for promotion will be promoted.
(iii) The number of officers authorized by the Secretary to serve in an active status in the grade

status.
(3)(A) The Secretary may, when the needs of the Coast Guard require, authorize the consideration
of officers in a grade above lieutenant (junior grade) for promotion to the next higher grade from
below the promotion zone.
(B) When selection from below the promotion zone is authorized, the Secretary shall establish the
number of officers that may be recommended for promotion from below the promotion zone. That
number may not exceed the number equal to 10 percent of the maximum number of officers that the
board is authorized to recommend for promotion, except that the Secretary may authorize a greater
number, not to exceed 15 percent of the total number of officers that the board is authorized to
recommend for promotion, if the Secretary determines that the needs of the Coast Guard so require.
If the maximum number determined under this subparagraph is less than one, the board may
recommend one officer for promotion from below the promotion zone.
(C) The number of officers recommended for promotion from below the promotion zone does not
increase the maximum number of officers that the board is authorized to recommend for promotion
under paragraph (2).
(e) The law and regulations relating to the selection for promotion of a commissioned officer of
the Regular Coast Guard to the grades of rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral apply to a
Reserve officer, except that to be eligible for consideration for promotion to the grade of rear admiral
(lower half) an officer shall have completed at least ten years commissioned service, of which the
last five years shall have been served in the Coast Guard Reserve.
(f) The provisions of section 2117 of this title apply to boards convened under this section. The
Secretary shall determine the procedure to be used by a selection board.
(g) The report of a selection board shall be submitted to the Secretary for review and transmission
to the President for approval. When an officer recommended by a board for promotion is not
acceptable to the President, the President may remove the name of that officer from the report of the
board.
(h) The recommendations of a selection board, as approved by the President, constitute a list of
selectees from which the promotions of Reserve officers shall be made. An officer on a list of
selectees remains thereon until promoted unless removed by the President under section 3749 of this
title. If an existing list of selectees has not been exhausted by the time a later list has been approved,
all officers remaining on the older list shall be tendered appointments prior to those on the later list.
(i) A Reserve officer whose name is on a list of selectees for promotion shall, unless that officer's
promotion is lawfully withheld, be tendered an appointment in the next higher grade on the date a
vacancy occurs, or as soon thereafter as practicable in the grade to which the officer was selected for
promotion or, if promotion was determined in accordance with a running mate system, at the same
time, or as soon thereafter as practicable, as that officer's running mate is tendered a similar
appointment.

approximately the same time as that officer's running mate or as soon thereafter as practicable, or in
the event that promotion is not determined in accordance with a running mate system, then a Reserve

qualified, but unless so transferred shall, in the discretion of the Secretary, be transferred to the
inactive status list or discharged as follows:
(1) if removed from an active status under subsection (a)(1) of this section, on June 30 next

appointed in a grade above ensign is considered to have the actual total commissioned service
performed in a grade above commissioned warrant officer or the same total commissioned service as
an officer of the Regular Coast Guard who has served continuously from an original appointment as
ensign, who has not lost numbers or precedence, and who is, or was, junior to the Reserve officer,
