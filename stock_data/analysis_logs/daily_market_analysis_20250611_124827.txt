  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity indicates a high level of uncertainty and skepticism, particularly in the Public Square, with some users questioning the validity of information. Executive channel activity suggests potential policy shifts or internal disagreements. Minimal activity in Congress and States channels indicates a lack of immediate legislative or governmental impact. This overall suggests a cautious market sentiment.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a mixed picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target, necessitating a higher volatility parameter. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) and low market confidence (35%) contribute to a negative trend direction. Low unemployment (3.2%) provides some positive momentum, but is overshadowed by the other factors.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to high inflation and negative GDP growth. Increased volatility is expected. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, contingent on future economic policy and inflation control. Sector rotation is likely, with investors moving towards defensive sectors.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and economic momentum. Volatility is set to 1.10 to account for the high inflation rate. Market sentiment is aligned with the low market confidence at 0.35. Momentum is slightly positive at 0.25 due to low unemployment. Long-term outlook is adjusted slightly downward to 0.41 to reflect the current economic uncertainties."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to inflation and potential supply constraints.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook due to economic uncertainty and reduced consumer spending.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral outlook, with potential for volatility due to interest rate hikes.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive outlook as a defensive sector, less sensitive to economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook due to slowing economic growth and potential supply chain disruptions.",
    "RETAIL": "Mixed outlook, with discount retailers performing better than luxury brands.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to negative outlook, sensitive to interest rate hikes and economic slowdown.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative outlook due to reduced economic activity and potential fuel cost increases."
