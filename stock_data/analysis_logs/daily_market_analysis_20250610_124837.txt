    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows low confidence and a generally negative sentiment. The 'coffin' comment in Public Square and the lack of positive discussion in Congress indicate a bearish outlook. Executive messages are brief and don't inspire confidence.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth (stagflation) creates a challenging environment for businesses and investors. The relatively low unemployment rate is a minor positive, but not enough to offset the other negative factors.",
    "market_outlook": "The market is expected to be bearish in the short term due to the combination of high inflation, negative GDP growth, and low market confidence. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles (e.g., Finance, Energy) are likely to underperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative to reflect the GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment is low, mirroring the confidence data. Momentum is weak due to the lack of economic growth. The long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the increased uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Underperform. High inflation and potential recessionary pressures will likely reduce demand for energy. Expect volatility and downward pressure on prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to slightly negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment may decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "FINANCE": "Underperform. Rising interest rates and a slowing economy will negatively impact the financial sector. Expect increased loan defaults and reduced profitability.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector, but rising costs and potential policy changes create uncertainty.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Underperform. A slowing economy will reduce demand for manufactured goods. Expect production cuts and potential layoffs.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to slightly negative. Retail sales may decline as consumers cut back on discretionary spending due to inflation.",
    "TECH": "Neutral. While some tech companies are resilient, the sector is generally sensitive to economic cycles. Expect increased volatility and potential downward pressure on valuations.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Underperform. Reduced economic activity will lead to lower demand for transportation services. Expect lower revenues and potential job losses."
