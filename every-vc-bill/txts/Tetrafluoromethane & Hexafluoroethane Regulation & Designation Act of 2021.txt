Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980
Be it enacted by the House of Representatives of the United States of America in
Congress Assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the “Tetrafluoromethane & Hexafluoroethane Regulation & Designation Act”
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(a) Tetrafluoromethane and Hexafluoroethane are both major contributors to the greenhouse effect
and are potent greenhouse gases.
(b) Tetrafluoromethane has an atmospheric lifetime of 50,000 years and a greenhouse warming
potential of 6,500.
(i) For reference, Carbon dioxide has a greenhouse warming potential of 1.
(c) Hexafluoroethane has an atmospheric lifetime of 10,000 years and a global warming potential
of 9,200.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
In this Act—
(a) TETRAFLUOROMETHANE.— Also known as Carbon Tetrafluoride, is the simplest
perfluorocarbon and a perfluorinated counterpart to methane. It has a chemical formula of CF
4
and is a bond of one carbon and four fluorine atoms.
(b) HEXAFLUOROETHANE.— A perfluorocarbon counterpart to the hydrocarbon ethane. It has
a chemical formula of C F and contains two carbon and six fluorine atoms.

(c) ADMINISTRATOR.— The term “Administrator” means the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency
(d) PHASE DOWN.— A slowing down of a process through phases.
(e) REGULATED SUBSTANCE.— The term regulated substances refers to the the Consolidated
List of Chemical
SEC. 4. DESIGNATION OF TETRAFLUOROMETHANE AND HEXAFLUOROETHANE AS
HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS.
(a) DESIGNATION.— No later than 100 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the
Administrator shall issue a final rule adding, as a class, Tetrafluoromethane and
Hexafluoroethane to the list of hazardous air pollutants under section 112(b) of the Clean Air
Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(b)).
(b) SOURCES CATEGORIES.— No later than 6 months after the final rule is issued under
subsection (a), the Administration shall revise the list under Section 112(c)(1) of the Clean Air
Act ((42 U.S.C. 7412(c)(1)) to include categories and subcategories of major sources and area
sources of Tetrafluoromethane and Hexafluoroethane listed pursuant to the final rule.
SEC. 5. PHASE-DOWN OF PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF
TETRAFLUOROMETHANE & HEXAFLUOROETHANE.
(a) IN GENERAL.— During the period beginning on January 1 of each year listed in the table
contained in subsection (c) and ending on December 31 of the year before the next year listed
on that table, except as otherwise permitted under this Act, no person shall—
(i) Produce a quantity of regulated substances without a corresponding quantity of
production allowances.
(ii) Consume a quantity of regulated substances without a corresponding quantity of
consumption allowances.

(b) COMPLIANCE.—For each year listed on the table contained in subsection (c), the
Administrator shall ensure that the annual quantity of all regulated substances produced or
consumed in the United States does not exceed the product obtained by multiplying the
applicable percentage listed on the table contained in subsection (c).
(c) RELATION TO BASELINE.—On January 1 of each year listed in the following table, the
Administrator shall apply the applicable percentage, as described in subsection (a):
Date Percentage of Production Percentage of Consumption
Baseline Baseline
2021-2024………………….. 90 percent 90 percent
2025-2029………………….. 60 percent 60 percent
2030-2034………………….. 30 percent 30 percent
2035-2037………………….. 20 percent 20 percent
2038 and thereafter……….... 15 percent 15 percent
(d) REGULATION REGARDING PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF
TETRAFLUOROMETHANE & HEXAFLUOROETHANE.— No later than 270 days after the
date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall issue a final rule of the following—
(i) Phasing down the production of Tetrafluoromethane and Hexafluoroethane in the
United States through an allowance allocation and trading program in accordance with
this act.
(ii) Phasing down the consumption of Tetrafluoromethane and Hexafluoroethane in the
United States through an allowance allocation and trading program in accordance with
the schedule under subsection (c).
SEC. 6. ENACTMENT.
EFFECTIVE DATE.— The provisions of this Act shall come into force immediately upon passage.
