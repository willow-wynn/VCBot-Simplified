Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act
(Sec. 3) This bill amends the federal criminal code to make it a crime for any person to perform
or attempt to perform an abortion if the probable post-fertilization age of the fetus is 20 weeks or
more.
A violator is subject to criminal penaltiesâ€”a fine, up to five years in prison, or both.
The bill provides exceptions for an abortion: (1) that is necessary to save the life of the pregnant
woman, or (2) when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. A physician who performs or
attempts to perform an abortion under an exception must comply with specified requirements.
A woman who undergoes a prohibited abortion may not be prosecuted for violating or conspiring
to violate the provisions of this bill.
A woman who undergoes an abortion or attempted abortion may file a civil action for damages
against an individual who violates the provisions of this bill.
