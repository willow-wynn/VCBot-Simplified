    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress and Executive channels, indicating potential policy changes and executive actions impacting the market. The public square discussion about campaigns in North Dakota suggests regional economic interests are being debated. Overall, the high volume of messages suggests increased uncertainty and potential volatility.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) necessitates aggressive monetary policy. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) signals a potential recession. Unemployment (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low (35%), reflecting the overall economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish in the short term. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to further market corrections. Increased policy debates and potential executive actions add to the uncertainty. Expect volatility across all sectors, with energy potentially being an exception due to continued supply constraints.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative (-0.25) to reflect the negative GDP growth and economic momentum. Volatility is high (0.95) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to align with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive (0.20) to account for the slightly elevated unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly decreased to 0.35 to reflect the current economic conditions."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and supply constraints will likely keep energy prices elevated.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending may decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and potential recession will negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but policy changes could introduce volatility.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Decreased consumer spending and potential trade disruptions will negatively impact manufacturing.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Inflation and economic uncertainty will likely decrease consumer spending.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies are sensitive to economic cycles, but some may benefit from increased remote work.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Mixed outlook due to energy prices and consumer spending."
