    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, a cautious market outlook is warranted. Expect continued volatility and a downward trend. Sectors sensitive to economic growth, such as finance and consumer discretionary, may underperform. Energy may benefit from inflation, but overall, risk aversion is expected to dominate.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the large deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, matching the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly reduced to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic climate."

    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Economic slowdown and higher input costs may negatively impact manufacturing.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending may shift towards essential goods, impacting discretionary retail.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech faces headwinds from higher interest rates and potential slowdown in business investment.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Mixed outlook, with potential benefits from infrastructure spending offset by economic slowdown."
