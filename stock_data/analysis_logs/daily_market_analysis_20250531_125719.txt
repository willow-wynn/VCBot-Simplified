Investors are likely to be risk-averse, favoring defensive stocks. The market will likely react negatively to any further negative economic news.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to the GDP decline. Volatility is high due to the significant inflation deviation. Market sentiment matches the low confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to the unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly decreased to reflect the current economic challenges."

    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is sensitive to economic cycles and may suffer during a recession. CAT, GE, and LMT are likely to experience downward pressure.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector faces challenges as consumers cut back on spending. WMT and COST may perform better than other retailers due to their focus on essential goods.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector is mixed. While some companies like AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are resilient, they are still susceptible to market downturns. Expect increased volatility.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transport sector is closely tied to economic activity and is expected to underperform. BA will face significant headwinds."
