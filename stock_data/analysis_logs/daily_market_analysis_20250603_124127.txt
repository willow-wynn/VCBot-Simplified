News volume is moderate, indicating ongoing developments but not panic. Overall, Discord activity suggests cautious pessimism.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target (2.0%), leading to increased volatility. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates a recessionary environment, pulling trend direction downwards. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low (35%), reflecting the overall economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to the recessionary environment and high inflation. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Energy sector may see some gains due to inflation, but most other sectors will struggle. Long-term outlook remains uncertain, dependent on the effectiveness of government and Fed policies.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and economic momentum. Volatility is set to 1.15 to account for the high inflation rate. Market sentiment is aligned with the low market confidence at 0.35. Momentum is slightly reduced to 0.20 due to the weak economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.35 to reflect the overall economic uncertainty."

    "ENERGY": "Energy sector outlook is cautiously positive due to high inflation and potential supply constraints. Expect some upward pressure on energy stock prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector outlook is negative due to reduced consumer spending in a recessionary environment. Expect downward pressure on entertainment stock prices.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector outlook is negative due to the potential for increased loan defaults and reduced investment activity. Expect downward pressure on financial stock prices.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector outlook is relatively stable as healthcare is a necessity. Expect moderate performance from healthcare stocks.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector outlook is negative due to reduced business investment and consumer spending. Expect downward pressure on manufacturing stock prices.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector outlook is negative due to reduced consumer spending and high inflation. Expect downward pressure on retail stock prices.",
    "TECH": "Technology sector outlook is moderately negative due to reduced business investment and consumer spending. Expect downward pressure on tech stock prices.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector outlook is negative due to reduced economic activity and trade. Expect downward pressure on transportation stock prices."
