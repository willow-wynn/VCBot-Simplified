Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low, reflecting the overall economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment, the market is expected to be bearish in the short term. High volatility is anticipated due to inflation concerns. Sectors that are defensive or benefit from inflation (e.g., energy) may outperform, while growth-oriented sectors may struggle.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the Fed's target. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting some resilience in the labor market. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the increased economic uncertainty."

    "ENERGY": "Positive. Benefits from inflation and potential supply constraints.",

    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Relatively defensive sector, but faces cost pressures from inflation.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Impacted by decreased demand and increased input costs.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. High growth tech companies are likely to struggle in a high interest rate environment.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Mixed outlook, with some segments benefiting from inflation and others facing decreased demand."
