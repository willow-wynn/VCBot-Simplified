168th CONGRESS
1st SESSION
H.R.2.
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
August 16, 2023
Representative Mr. Sullivan of Olympia (for himself,) introduced the following bill;
A BILL
To Repeal and partially replace poorly-written acts
Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress Assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
SHORT TITLE. — This Act may be cited as the “Arcane Acts Repeal Part Three Act of 2023”.
SECTION 2. SEVERABILITY AND SUPREMACY.
(a) SEVERABILITY. — Should any one or more provision, section, subsection, sentence,
clause, phrase, word, application of this Act be deemed invalid or unconstitutional for
any reason in a court with relevant jurisdiction, the rest of the Act, and the application of
the remaining provisions, shall not be affected.
(b) SUPREMACY. — Should any provision or portion of the existing law violate or
contradict any section of this Act, it shall be declared null and void.
SECTION 3. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that: —
(a) The Arcane Acts Repeal Part Two Act of 2023, as signed into law, repealed thirty-five
separate laws that were regarded by the Congress of the United States to be either poorly-
written, unenforceable, or otherwise disparaging;
(b) The General Appropriations and Budget Act of March-May 2023, as signed into law,
contained a section titled “Repealing Arcane Acts”, which temporarily suspended 52
different laws for a 90-day period, so as to give congress time to resolve these
contradictory poorly-written bills;
(c) It is high time that the work contained within these two laws is expounded upon, so as to
create a legal code worthy of the international recognition and prestige that the American
people deserve; and
(d) This act restores over 23 billion in crucial supplementary funding to programs previously
established by this congress, restoring authorizations for several programs (including $20

billion in authorizations for the American Semiconductor Industry), while also repealing
nearly X laws, and amending several others.
SECTION 4. TAX LAW REPEALS.
(a) UPDATED MINIMUM WAGE LAW. —
i. FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
(1) The Updated Living Wage Law was de-facto superseded by the Fair
Labor Standard Amendment Act of 2020.
ii. REPEAL. —
(1) The Updated Minimum Wage Law is repealed.
(b) THE ESTATE TAX REFORM ACT. —
i. FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
(1) The Estate Tax Reform Act of 2020 was de-facto superseded by Section
15 of the General Appropriations and Budget Act of March-May 2023.
ii. REPEAL. —
(1) The Estate Tax Reform Act is repealed.
(c) TAX REFORM ACT. —
i. FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
(1) The Tax Reform Act was de-facto superseded by the Fair Taxation Act,
as amended by the General Appropriations and Budget Act of March-
May 2023.
ii. REPEAL. —
(1) The Tax Reform Act is repealed.
(d) PAYING A FAIR SHARE ACT. —
i. Findings. — Congress finds that:
(1) The Paying a Fair Share act was de-facto superseded by the Fair
Taxation Act, as amended by the General Appropriations and Budget
Act of March-May 2023.
ii. REPEAL. —
(1) The Paying a Fair Share Act is repealed.
(e) ADOPTION TAX CREDIT ACT. —
i. FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
(1) While presumably well intentioned, the Adoption Tax Credit Act fails to
provide for any definition of “adoption”, or any limitation on the types
of expenses that may be filed refundable under the “Adoption expenses”
tax credit, or even whether the credit applies to humans or pets.
ii. REPEAL. —
(1) The Adoption Tax Credit Act is repealed.
(f) VAPE REVENUE ACT. —
i. FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
(1) The VAPE Revenue Act fails to properly define “e-cigarette”; and
(2) A new law to properly impose taxes on e-cigarettes, and hike taxes on
tobacco, is crucial to preventing addiction.

ii. REPEAL. —
(1) The VAPE Revenue Act is repealed.
(g) RETURN FREE FILING ACT. —
i. FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
(1) The Bill to Instate Return Free Filing fails to deal with the intricacies of
the tax law, and further fails to allow Americans to claim a proper tax
return.
ii. REPEAL. —
(1) The Bill to Instate Return Free Filing is repealed.
SECTION 5. REPEALING ACTS AGAINST AMERICAN INDUSTRY.
(a) FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
i. The legislation repealed within this section has had a detrimental impact on the
American Shipbuilding industry, and thus deserves repeal. While it is acceptable
to have narrow exceptions to the Jones Act in the case of emergency, it is
unconscionable to eliminate the Jones Act in its entirety; and
ii. The Fossil Fuel Efficiency Bill of 2019’s poor writing has resulted in catastrophic
consequences to the United States. For example, it is unclear if the limitation on
land owned by corporations within Section 3(f) applies per-corporation or across
the board. Further, the bill primarily describes what it would like to do, rather
then actually doing things; constituting a syntax and grammatical structure unfit
for law.
(b) REPEAL. — The following bills are repealed in their entirety, with all federal operations
surrounding such bills ceasing no later than 60 days following the date of enactment of
this act, and with those in charge of the programs being repealed attempting to recuperate
all costs that were sunk into all programs and bills repealed by this section. —
i. The Merchant Marine Act of 2020;
ii. The Maritime Freedom Act of 2020; and
iii. The Fossil Fuel Efficiency Bill of 2019.
SECTION 6. HAEMONCHUS WORM REPEALS.
(a) FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
i. The Haemonchus worm epidemic is long gone, and as such, it’s high time that we
repeal the legislation directly regulating for it, as we’ve recently done with our
repeal of COVID-19 related legislation in the Arcane Acts Part Two Act of 2023;
and
ii. The Coronavirus Pandemic has also been eliminated, and as such certain acts with
relation to the pandemic do require repeal.
(b) REPEAL. — The following bills are repealed:
i. The Haemonchus Worm Halt and Elimination Act of 2020;
ii. The Save our Cattle and Improve American Livestock Act of 2020;
iii. The FEMA Emergency Spending Bill; and
iv. The MESE Act.

SECTION 7. RESTORING ONE-TIME EXPENDITURES.
(a) FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
i. Several bills have been enacted over the past few years with improperly worded
text, effectively circumventing the proper budgeting process and instead spend
money in other ways, meaning that whether any funds were ever allocated to the
ensuing projects is dubious;
ii. Due to the recent budgetary surplus, we can afford to fund these one-time
obligations that have gone unfunded;
iii. In the cases where such projects were important, it’s critical that funding is
properly allocated; and
iv. Congress reaffirms its commitment to following to proper budgetary process as
outlined under the Federal Law of the United States of America.
(b) YUCCA MOUNTAIN SPENT FUEL RESPOSITORY REINSTATEMENT ACT. —
i. Section 4 of the Yucca Mountain Spent Fuel Repository Reinstatement Act is
amended to read as follows:
“SECTION 4. SUPPLEMENTARY APPROPRIATIONS.
In General. —A sum of $15,000,000,000.00 is appropriated, out of any money in
the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to remain available until expended, for
the purpose of awarding contracts pursuant to section 3 of this act.”.
(c) POST WORKER SAFETY ACT. —
i. Section 5 of the Post Worker Safety act is amended to read as follows:
“SECTION 5. SUPPLEMENTARY APPROPRIATIONS.
In General. —A sum of $7,000,000,000.00 is appropriated to the United States
Postal Service, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to
remain available until expended, for the purpose of replacing Grumman Long Life
Vehicles owned by the United States Postal service with a design to the liking of
the Postmaster General of the United States, provided that such design:
(a) Contains the following —
a. Air Conditioning Units;
b. Emergency Airbags with 360 motion detection;
c. Heating Units;
d. Right Side Steering Wheels;
e. Insulating Units;
f. All-terrain truck tires;
g. L.E.Ds. placed around the truck in suitable places;
h. A higher frame than the Grumman Long Life Vehicle;
i. An electric engine; and
j. 360 Live Monitoring.;
(b) Is phased in as Grumman Long Life Vehicles succumb to wear and tear;
(c) Is contracted out to a company based within the United States; and
(d) Is fully manufactured within the United States.”.
ii. Section 4 of the Post Worker Safety act is repealed.

follows:
“SUPPLEMENTARY APPROPRIATIONS. — A sum of $1,000,000,000.00 is
appropriated to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, out of any
money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to remain available until
expended, for the purposes of covering all expenditures necessitated in order to
cover the operations of the program laid out within this act, including
contracting.”.
SECTION 8. GENERAL REPEALS.
(a) VETERAN’S AFFAIRS REFORM ACT. —
i. FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
(1) While well-intentioned, the end-result of the Veteran’s Affairs Reform
Act is nothing. The primary portion of this act, Article I, relates to an
increase in funding. However, Article I simply provide instructions for
what should be done within the standard budgetary process in a
roundabout manner, effectively attempting to circumvent it. Such an
increase should be done via supplemental appropriations, a raise in a cap
on authorizations for the Department (perhaps linked to a percentage
increase), or within the actual budget itself.
ii. REPEAL. —
(1) The Veteran’s Affairs Reform Act is repealed.
(b) INTO THE DARK ACT. —
i. FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
(1) What was found in Section 8(a)(i)(1) of this act also applies to the Into
The Dark Act.
ii. REPEAL. —
(1) The Into the Dark Act is repealed.
(c) WIC EXPANSION ACT. —
i. FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
(1) What was found in Section 8(a)(i)(1) of this act also applies to the
W.I.C. Expansion Act;
(2) Rather then enacting changes, the bill explains what changes should be
made; and
(3) Congress expresses it’s support for broad increases to the W.I.C. within
the next bi-monthly budget.
ii. REPEAL. —
(1) The WIC Expansion Act is repealed.
(d) NATIONAL SEXUAL EDUCATION REFORM ACT. —
i. FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
(1) Due to no clear definition of “public funding”, Articles 2 and 3 of this
act attempt to supersede state control of the Sexual Education curricula

funded on the local level, potentially running afoul of the constitution;
and
(2) The federal government of the United States currently has two grant
programs to help provide comprehensive sexual education, which
received a combined $24,500,000.00 in the last bi-monthly budget.
ii. REPEAL. —
(1) The National Sexual Education Reform Act is repealed.
(e) POORLY WRITTEN ACTS. —
i. FINDINGS. — Congress finds that:
(1) The acts repealed within this subsection are repealed for being generally
poorly written to the point where fixing them would be a de-facto
amendment in the nature of a substitute;
(2) In the case of the Rebuild America Act, congress stands committed to
properly allocating funds, and, as was found in Section 8(a)(i)(1) of this
act, attempting (and failing) to funnel over 400 billion dollars into a
poorly-researched infrastructure scheme is highly disappointing and
unbecoming of the government. Further, a proper infrastructure
spending law was already signed into law in 2020; and
(3) The need for some of these acts to be replaced with properly-written
alternatives is recognized.
ii. The following acts are repealed:
(1) The Farmer-Aid Act;
(2) The Federal Computer Modernization Act;
(3) A Bill to Improve the Conditions of Deportation;
(4) The Rebuild America Act; and
(5) The Sleeping Doctor Act.
SECTION 9. FIXING ACTS; RESTORING AUTHORIZATIONS
(a) A.C.R.E.S. ACT —
i. IN GENERAL. — The A.C.R.E.S. Act is amended by adding a new section,
section 6, to read as follows:
“Section 6. Definition —
The term “ASD” as used in this act shall refer to “Autism Spectrum Disorder”, as
expounded upon in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fifth Edition.”.
ii. FIXING AUTHORIZATIONS. — Section 3 of the A.C.R.E.S. Act is amended to
read as follows:
“There is authorized to be appropriated a sum of $148,000,000.00 each fiscal year
through 2025, for the purposes of carrying out programs and activities relating to
ASD contained within the provisions of this Act”.
(b) FOOD ACT. —
i. FIXING AUTHORIZATIONS. — Section 4 of the Food Act is amended to read
as follows:

“To provide for organization, inspection and other duties related to the program the
Department of Agriculture shall have the permission to hire up to one employee per ten
thousands (1/10,000) inhabitants of each State or up to at least one thousand (1000) per
State. They will be assigned to the various counties by the State’s Food Bank
Coordination Office. These assumptions shall be complemented by volunteers who will
aid the collection and distribution program. There is authorized to be appropriated a
sum of $500,000,000.00 each fiscal year for the purposes of carrying out the provisions
of this act.”.
(c) STAFF ACT. —

follows:

fiscal year, for the purposes of providing mental health assistance to

Healthcare System is amended to read as follows:

fiscal year, for the purpose of drug research investment subject to FDA review.”.
(e) UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL AND PREKINDERGARTEN GRANTS ACT. —
i. FINDINGS. — Congress finds that. —
(1) Currently, due to the “appropriated such sums as are necessary” rather
then “authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary”
language, no appropriations have been made within the Budgetary
Process for this program. Going forward, it is the sense of congress that
the Secretary of Education should, prior to each Bi-Monthly budgetary
period, submit an outline to congress detailing projected expenses for
grants issued under the act being amended by this subsection, so as to
allow congress to make proper appropriations via the budgetary process.
ii. FIXING AUTHORIZATIONS. — Section 4(a) of the Universal Preschool and
Prekindergarten Grants Act of 2021 is amended to read as follows:
“FUNDING. — There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of
