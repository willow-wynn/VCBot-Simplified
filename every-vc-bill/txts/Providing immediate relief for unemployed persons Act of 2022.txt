IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES
February 4th, 2022
Mr. LEGO of Olympia, (for himself,) introduced the following resolution;
⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
A JOINT RESOLUTION
Providing immediate relief for unemployed persons.
Be it enacted by the House of Representative and the Senate in the Congress of
the United States of America assembled,
Whereas. the United States has entered a recession due to low consumer confidence and low investor
confidence following a decrease in government spending;
Whereas, deflation is occurring;
Whereas, sending direct payment checks to all individuals is fiscally irresponsible, and will lead to
inflation and the inefficient dispersion of funds;
Whereas, quarterly real GDP is $2 trillion less than it should be;
Whereas, an increase in government spending by $525 billion should return the GDP to higher than
pre-contractionary levels;
Whereas, unemployment is at 9%, which is disturbingly high;

2
Whereas, the unemployed require immediate relief while Congress discusses further appropriations to be
made;
Resolved, that Congress declares that there exists a state of emergency within the United States, due to
economic recession;
Resolved, that there are authorized to be appropriated a total of $141,786,000,000 in excess of the limit
established in Section 1 of the 40th Amendment to the Constitution over the next 2 fiscal months for
direct distribution of checks to persons designated as having been unemployed for at least 2 months prior
to the introduction of this joint resolution, which shall not exceed $10,000 per person.
