News activity is low, suggesting that the market is more influenced by internal factors than external news events.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. The unemployment rate is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low, reflecting the overall economic uncertainty. The Fed's inability to control inflation is a major concern.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to the stagflationary environment. High volatility is expected. Long-term outlook remains cautiously pessimistic, with potential for recovery if inflation is brought under control and GDP growth resumes. Expect defensive sectors to outperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the high inflation rate. Market sentiment is low, mirroring the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to the slightly elevated unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic conditions."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive: Energy sector benefits from inflation and geopolitical instability.",

    "HEALTH": "Positive: Healthcare sector is relatively stable and defensive during economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral to Negative: Manufacturing sector is affected by reduced demand and supply chain disruptions.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative: Retail sector suffers from reduced consumer spending and inflation.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative: Tech sector faces challenges due to high valuations and potential interest rate hikes.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral: Transportation sector is affected by reduced economic activity but supported by essential services."
