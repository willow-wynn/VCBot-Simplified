  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on legislative action and political maneuvering, with limited discussion of specific economic or market factors. The high volume of messages in the 'CONGRESS' channel suggests potential policy shifts, but the lack of clear market signals keeps the impact neutral. The 'NEWS' channel activity is minimal, indicating a lack of immediate market-moving news.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target, while GDP growth is negative (-1.2%). Unemployment is low (3.2%), but this could be masking underlying economic weakness. Market confidence is low at 35%, reflecting the overall economic uncertainty. The negative GDP growth and high inflation suggest a potential stagflationary environment.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish due to the unfavorable economic indicators. High inflation will likely lead to further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which could further dampen economic growth. Low market confidence and negative GDP growth suggest a risk-off environment, with investors likely to favor defensive assets. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (1.15) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to match the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive (0.25) due to the low unemployment rate, but is tempered by the overall economic weakness. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.41 to reflect the increased economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decline in a recessionary environment. DIS and NFLX face headwinds.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face increased regulatory scrutiny and potential loan losses in a slowing economy. JPM, BAC, GS, and V are vulnerable.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is generally defensive, but faces cost pressures. JNJ, PFE, and UNH are expected to be relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Manufacturing faces supply chain disruptions and slowing demand. CAT and GE face mixed prospects.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decline, impacting retailers. WMT, COST, and HD face challenges.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies face slowing growth and increased regulatory scrutiny. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA face headwinds.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation is sensitive to economic cycles. BA and LMT face mixed prospects, with defense potentially offering some support."
