    "discord_impact": "High message volume in Congress and Public Square suggests active debate and uncertainty. News and Executive channels are relatively quiet, indicating less immediate policy impact. The focus seems to be on internal discussions and less on external events.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation, negative GDP growth, and elevated unemployment (above the natural rate) create a stagflationary environment. Market confidence is low, reflecting this economic anxiety. The base parameters reflect this with negative trend direction and high volatility.",
    "market_outlook": "The market is likely to experience continued volatility and a downward trend in the short term. High inflation will pressure corporate earnings and consumer spending. Negative GDP growth will further dampen investor sentiment. Expect defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples to outperform, while growth-oriented sectors like technology and entertainment will struggle.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative to reflect the GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment aligns directly with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly reduced to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced, acknowledging the current economic headwinds but not completely pessimistic."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to persistent inflation and potential supply constraints. Expect continued high prices and strong performance from energy companies.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook due to discretionary spending cuts by consumers amid high inflation and economic uncertainty. Streaming services and entertainment venues may see reduced demand.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to slightly negative outlook. Banks may face increased loan losses due to the economic slowdown. Higher interest rates could improve net interest margins, but overall profitability will be challenged.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive outlook as healthcare is a defensive sector. Demand for healthcare services and products remains relatively stable regardless of economic conditions.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook due to slowing economic growth and potential supply chain disruptions. Demand for manufactured goods may decline as businesses and consumers reduce spending.",
    "RETAIL": "Mixed outlook. Discount retailers may benefit from consumers seeking cheaper alternatives. However, overall retail sales are likely to decline due to reduced consumer spending.",
    "TECH": "Negative outlook as growth stocks are generally more sensitive to rising interest rates and economic uncertainty. Expect reduced investment in technology and slower growth rates.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral outlook. Transportation companies may face reduced demand for freight and passenger services due to the economic slowdown. However, essential transportation services will remain in demand."
