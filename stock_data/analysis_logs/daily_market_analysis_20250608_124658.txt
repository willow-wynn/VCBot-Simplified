    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Low market confidence and high unemployment (relative to the natural rate) further exacerbate the situation. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major concern.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to the stagflationary environment. High volatility is expected. Sectors sensitive to interest rates and consumer spending will likely underperform. Energy and Healthcare may offer some defensive positioning. Long-term outlook remains uncertain, dependent on policy responses.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to the GDP contraction. Volatility is high, reflecting the inflation crisis. Market sentiment mirrors the low confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to the low unemployment. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decline in a recession. DIS and NFLX face headwinds.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative outlook. Banks face increased regulatory scrutiny and potential loan losses. JPM, BAC, GS face challenges.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive outlook. Healthcare is a defensive sector. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are expected to outperform.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral outlook. CAT and GE are sensitive to economic cycles but may benefit from infrastructure spending.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative outlook. Consumer spending is under pressure. WMT, COST, and HD face challenges.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative outlook. High-growth tech stocks are vulnerable to rising interest rates. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA face headwinds.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral outlook. BA is sensitive to economic cycles and geopolitical risks."
