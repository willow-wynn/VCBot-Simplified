  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity indicates a focus on legislative action and political maneuvering, with limited discussion of specific economic or market factors. The high message volume in Congress suggests potential policy shifts, but the lack of market-related discussion tempers the impact. The low activity in Executive and States channels suggests limited immediate policy impact from those areas. Public Square activity is moderate, indicating some general interest, but not focused on market-moving events.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target (2.0%), indicating persistent price pressures. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) signals a potential recession. Market confidence is low (35%), reflecting the economic uncertainty. While unemployment is low (3.2%), it is approaching the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), suggesting limited further improvement in the labor market. These factors collectively point to a challenging economic environment.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the negative economic indicators and low market confidence, a cautious market outlook is warranted. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic growth, such as finance and consumer discretionary, are likely to underperform. Defensive sectors, such as healthcare and energy, may offer some relative protection. The market's overall trend is likely to be negative in the short term, with potential for brief rallies followed by further declines.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic momentum. Volatility is set to 0.95 to account for the high inflation rate and market uncertainty. Market sentiment is aligned with the low market confidence at 0.35. Momentum is set to 0.25, reflecting the slowing economic growth and approaching natural unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.41 to account for the increased risk of recession."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment is likely to decline in a recessionary environment. DIS and NFLX are expected to underperform.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and a slowing economy will negatively impact financial institutions. JPM, BAC, V, and GS are expected to underperform.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is a defensive sector that tends to hold up relatively well during economic downturns. JNJ and UNH are expected to be relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Manufacturing will be impacted by economic slowdown, but defense spending could provide some offset. CAT and GE are expected to be neutral.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decline, impacting retail sales. WMT, COST, and HD are expected to underperform.",
    "TECH": "Negative. Tech companies are sensitive to economic growth and rising interest rates. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are expected to underperform.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation will be impacted by economic slowdown, but defense spending could provide some offset. BA and LMT are expected to be neutral."
