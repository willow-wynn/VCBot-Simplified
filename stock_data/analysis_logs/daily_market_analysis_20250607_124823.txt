    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low, reflecting the economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment, the market is expected to be bearish in the short term. Sectors that are sensitive to economic cycles, such as consumer discretionary and financials, are likely to underperform. Defensive sectors like healthcare and energy may offer some protection. Long-term outlook remains uncertain, dependent on fiscal and monetary policy responses.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, aligning with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to the still-low unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly decreased to reflect the current economic challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints due to geopolitical factors support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decrease in a recessionary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Higher interest rates and potential loan defaults could negatively impact the financial sector.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Healthcare is a defensive sector and less sensitive to economic cycles.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Manufacturing will be affected by the economic downturn, but government spending on infrastructure could provide some support.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is expected to decline due to inflation and recession fears.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies are sensitive to economic cycles, but some segments like cloud computing may remain resilient.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation will be affected by the economic downturn, but essential services will continue."
