  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political campaigns and legislative actions, with a notable veto. This indicates uncertainty and potential policy shifts, contributing to market volatility. The veto of the American Symbols Act suggests potential clashes between the executive and legislative branches, adding to the overall market unease.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%), coupled with negative GDP growth (-1.2%), indicates stagflation. Unemployment at 4.2% is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low at 35%, reflecting the negative economic sentiment.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment and low market confidence, a cautious market outlook is warranted. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic growth, such as consumer discretionary and financials, are likely to underperform. Defensive sectors like healthcare and energy may offer some resilience. The high inflation rate necessitates a focus on companies with strong pricing power.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic downturn. Volatility is high (1.15) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to match the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive (0.15) reflecting the unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced (0.35) due to the current economic conditions."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to high inflation and potential supply constraints. Expect increased demand and higher prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook due to economic downturn and reduced consumer spending. Streaming services and discretionary entertainment will likely suffer.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative outlook due to potential interest rate hikes and economic uncertainty. Banks and financial institutions may face increased risks.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to positive outlook as healthcare is generally recession-resistant. Demand for healthcare services remains stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook due to slowing economic growth and potential supply chain disruptions. Industrial production may decline.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative outlook due to reduced consumer spending and high inflation. Discretionary retail will likely underperform.",
    "TECH": "Neutral outlook. Some tech companies may be impacted by reduced business investment, while others may benefit from increased demand for cloud services and cybersecurity.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral outlook. Transportation may be affected by decreased manufacturing, but energy sector strength could offset the losses."
