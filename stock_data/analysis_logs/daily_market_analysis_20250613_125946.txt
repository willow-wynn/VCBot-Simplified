High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth (stagflation) creates a challenging environment for businesses and investors. Unemployment is low, but this may not last if GDP continues to decline. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major concern.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Investors are likely to remain cautious until there are clear signs of improvement in the economic data.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the large deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, reflecting the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly negative, reflecting the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral. Consumer spending may decline due to inflation, but streaming services may hold up relatively well.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and potential for recession are headwinds for the financial sector.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally defensive, but faces cost pressures.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Slowing economic growth and rising input costs are challenges.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decline due to inflation.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Some tech companies are more resilient than others, but overall growth is slowing.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Slowing economic activity will reduce demand for transportation services."
