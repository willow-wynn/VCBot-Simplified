Sectors sensitive to economic cycles, such as manufacturing and finance, are likely to underperform. Energy may see some support due to inflation.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, aligning with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly lower to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic challenges."

    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally more resilient to economic downturns, but faces pressure from inflation.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing is highly sensitive to economic cycles and will likely suffer from reduced demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is expected to decline due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies may face reduced growth prospects due to slowing economic activity.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Reduced economic activity will lead to lower demand for transportation services."
