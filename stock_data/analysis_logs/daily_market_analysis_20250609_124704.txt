    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish due to the stagflationary environment. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic downturns, such as consumer discretionary and financials, are likely to underperform. Defensive sectors like healthcare and energy may offer some resilience.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation. Market sentiment is low, reflecting poor confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to low unemployment, but overall negative. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect current economic concerns."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices.",

    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is a defensive sector and should remain relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Manufacturing will be affected by economic slowdown, but government spending could provide some support.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending will be constrained by inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies may face reduced growth due to economic conditions.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation will be affected by economic slowdown, but essential services will remain in demand."
