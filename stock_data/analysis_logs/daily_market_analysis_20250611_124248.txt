While unemployment is low, it's nearing the natural rate, limiting further improvement. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major headwind.",
    "market_outlook": "The market faces significant headwinds from inflation and slowing growth. Expect continued volatility and a downward trend. Sectors like energy and manufacturing may outperform due to inflation, while tech and entertainment face challenges. Defensive stocks in retail and healthcare could offer some stability.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to GDP decline. Volatility is high due to inflation. Market sentiment is low, reflecting poor confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to low unemployment, but overall weak. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced due to economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Discretionary spending is likely to decline with inflation. NFLX and DIS face headwinds.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face pressure from a slowing economy and potential interest rate hikes. JPM, BAC, GS, and BRK.B are vulnerable.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally defensive, but faces cost pressures. JNJ, UNH, and PFE may offer some stability.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral to Positive. Infrastructure spending could provide some support, but global slowdown is a risk. CAT and GE may benefit from targeted policies.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral. Discount retailers may outperform as consumers seek value. WMT and COST could see increased traffic.",
    "TECH": "Negative. High valuations and slowing growth make tech vulnerable to a correction. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA face challenges.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Boeing (BA) faces continued supply chain issues and uncertainty in air travel demand. Government contracts provide some stability."
