    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political campaigns and some executive action. This suggests a slight increase in uncertainty and potential policy shifts, but the limited volume in Congress and Executive channels indicates that major changes are not immediately expected. News velocity is moderate due to political ads.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low, reflecting the overall economic uncertainty. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major concern.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to the stagflationary environment. High volatility is expected. Sectors that are defensive or benefit from inflation (e.g., energy, healthcare) may outperform, while consumer discretionary and growth stocks may struggle. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, assuming the Fed can eventually bring inflation under control.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, aligning with the low market confidence. Momentum is reduced to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the increased economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. Benefits from high inflation and potential supply constraints.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decrease in a stagflationary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face increased risk of loan defaults and reduced lending activity.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Defensive sector, less sensitive to economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Mixed outlook, dependent on specific industries and export demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Growth stocks are generally under pressure in a high-inflation environment.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Mixed outlook, dependent on trade and consumer demand."
