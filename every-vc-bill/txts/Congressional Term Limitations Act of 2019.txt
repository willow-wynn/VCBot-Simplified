ORIGINAL LAW
PROPOSED BY CONGRESSMAN DOSS (I-TX)
SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT ON 12/15/19
PUBLISHED ON 3/21/23 BY SARA
Section 1. —
Each able bodied member of congress cannot serve more than a cumulative term of ten
years.
Section 2. —
Cumulative time is calculated from the beginning of the first term of the members of
Congress, and subsequent years thereafter.
Section 3. —
A “break” in between terms (I.e. a member loses an election, and runs again and wins) does
not further the ten year limitation. They are bound to a total of ten (1) years total within
their respective body.
Section 4. —
Upon reaching the end of the cumulative time limit, the member of Congress will be
considered “retired from their seat” and will be able to opt for continuation of benefits at a
cost provided by the insurer of their choice.
Section 5. —
In the event that said member reaches their term limit and does not face opposition or their
opponent either recused themselves / is disqualified, the governor of said state will enact
power under the 17th amendment of the United States Constitution. This member will act as
representative pro-tempore until the next election cycle. This time will not be held against
the cumulative time limitations as described above.
