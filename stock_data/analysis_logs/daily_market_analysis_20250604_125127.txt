    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative to reflect GDP decline. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment aligns with low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to recent employment data. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, assuming eventual policy adjustments."

    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral outlook. CAT and GE are sensitive to economic cycles but may benefit from infrastructure spending.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative outlook as consumer spending declines. WMT and COST face challenges.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to negative outlook. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are impacted by economic slowdown but have strong fundamentals.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral outlook. BA is recovering from past issues but faces economic headwinds and geopolitical risks. LMT benefits from geopolitical tensions."
