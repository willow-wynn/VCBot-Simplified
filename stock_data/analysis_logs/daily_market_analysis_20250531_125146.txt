    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of political discussion and general chatter, with limited direct impact on specific stocks. The overall sentiment is slightly negative due to the political nature of some conversations. The high message volume in Congress suggests potential policy changes are being discussed, but the lack of specific details makes it difficult to assess the market impact.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target, leading to increased volatility. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates a potential recession, further dampening market sentiment. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. These factors contribute to a bearish outlook.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the negative economic indicators and low market confidence, the overall market outlook is bearish. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Investors are likely to be risk-averse, favoring defensive stocks and sectors. The high inflation rate will likely prompt further Fed action, potentially exacerbating the economic slowdown.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction: Reflects the negative GDP growth and economic momentum.\nvolatility: Aligns with the high inflation rate and market uncertainty.\nmarket_sentiment: Mirrors the low market confidence.\nmomentum: Adjusted slightly downward to reflect the slowing economic growth.\nlong_term_outlook: Slightly reduced to account for the increased risk of recession."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to persistent inflation and potential supply constraints. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform relatively well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Mixed outlook. DIS and NFLX face challenges due to economic slowdown and changing consumer behavior. EA may benefit from increased gaming activity during a recession.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative outlook. JPM, BAC, V, and GS are vulnerable to economic downturn and potential interest rate hikes. BRK.B may offer some stability due to its diversified holdings.",
    "HEALTH": "Relatively stable outlook. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are considered defensive stocks and may outperform during a recession. Demand for healthcare remains consistent.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook. CAT, GE, and LMT are sensitive to economic cycles and may experience reduced demand during a recession. LMT may benefit from geopolitical tensions.",
    "RETAIL": "Mixed outlook. WMT and COST may benefit from consumers seeking value during a recession. HD may face challenges due to reduced home improvement spending.",
    "TECH": "Mixed outlook. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA face challenges due to economic slowdown and potential regulatory scrutiny. NVDA may benefit from continued demand for AI and data center technologies.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative outlook. BA is vulnerable to economic downturn and potential travel restrictions. Supply chain issues continue to pose challenges."
