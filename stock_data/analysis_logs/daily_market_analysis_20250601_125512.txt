Market confidence is low (35%), reflecting the economic uncertainty.",

Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Energy sector may outperform due to inflation. Defensive sectors like healthcare may also hold up relatively well. Tech and Finance are expected to underperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction is set to -0.25 to reflect the negative GDP growth. volatility is set to 1.15 due to the high inflation rate. market_sentiment is set to 0.35 to align with the low market confidence. momentum is set to 0.20 to reflect slowing economic growth. long_term_outlook is slightly reduced to 0.35 to reflect the current economic concerns."
