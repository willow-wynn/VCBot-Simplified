SECTION 3. FINDINGS
(a) FINDINGS — Congress finds that —
(i) On December 18th at 4:08 pmi Eastern, it was
reported “A bomb recently detonated in downtown
Louisville, KY just a few moments ago. The bomb
injured four people and one person has been
hospitalized. The damage is extensive, with multiple
damaged buildings and shattered windows. Shortly
after, a letter written by “The A Organization” was
received by the Louisville Police Department, saying
they have started "the end of your deeds". Reporters
are now calling the group "The Second Unibombers".
A full police investigation is underway.”
(ii) On December 19th at 4:57 Eastern, it was reported
“A series of bombings has just occurred. Two bombs
around the state of Kentucky were recently
detonated, along with two in Memphis, Tennessee. A
total of 10 people have been injured, with 2 people
killed. Multiple letters to state governments and
police departments were received, all by "The A
Organization". A 24-hour police patrol in the affected
areas has been enacted, and some residents have
indefinitely evacuated. Police still cannot identify
who or what "The A Organization", and they are
struggling to predict the next attack.”
(iii) While further and more extensive legislation is
necessary and must be worked on, this is an
immediate first step.
