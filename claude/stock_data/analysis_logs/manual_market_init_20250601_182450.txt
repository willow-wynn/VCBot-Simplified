Reasoning:
{

  "discord_impact": "Low economic discourse but high political turmoil in Discord channels. Acting President situation and Speaker election drama increase uncertainty. Public complaints about inflation impacts reinforce bearish outlook.",
  "market_outlook": "Expect continued weakness across most sectors with defensive rotation. High inflation environment warrants 5-8% daily ranges. Tech and consumer discretionary most vulnerable, energy and staples relatively defensive."
