  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political campaigns and legislative actions, with a vetoed bill. This suggests uncertainty and potential gridlock, negatively impacting market sentiment. The high volume of messages in Congress indicates active debate but not necessarily productive outcomes.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation, negative GDP growth, and a slightly elevated unemployment rate contribute to a bearish outlook. The market is likely to react negatively to these conditions. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major concern.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish due to the combination of negative economic indicators and political uncertainty. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples may outperform, while growth stocks and cyclical sectors could underperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative to reflect the GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment is low, mirroring the poor market confidence. Momentum is reduced to reflect the slowing economy. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to acknowledge the immediate challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform relatively well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending may decline due to inflation, impacting entertainment companies. DIS and NFLX face headwinds.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and economic uncertainty could hurt financial institutions. JPM, BAC, GS, and V are vulnerable.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Healthcare is a defensive sector and should hold up relatively well during economic downturns. JNJ and UNH are favored.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral to Negative. Manufacturing is sensitive to economic cycles. CAT and GE may face challenges.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Inflation and reduced consumer spending will negatively impact retail companies. WMT, COST, and HD are at risk.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies are sensitive to interest rates and economic growth. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA face headwinds.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Boeing's performance is tied to global economic activity and defense spending. LMT is expected to be stable."
