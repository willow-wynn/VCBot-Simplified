    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high political discussion and some executive action, but limited economic or market-specific analysis. This suggests a focus on non-market factors, reducing direct impact on stock prices. The political ads may introduce some volatility.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a concerning picture: high inflation, negative GDP growth, and elevated unemployment. This stagflationary environment warrants a bearish outlook. The high inflation necessitates a higher volatility parameter. Negative GDP growth and low market confidence justify a negative trend direction and low market sentiment.",
    "market_outlook": "The market faces significant headwinds from the current economic climate. Expect continued volatility and a downward trend. Sectors sensitive to economic growth, such as finance and consumer discretionary, are likely to underperform. Energy may benefit from inflationary pressures. Defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples may offer some relative stability.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect negative GDP growth. Volatility is set to 1.10 to account for high inflation. Market sentiment is aligned with the 35% market confidence. Momentum is slightly reduced to 0.20 due to slowing economic activity. Long-term outlook is adjusted slightly down to 0.35 to reflect the increased economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector (XOM, CVX, COP) is expected to perform relatively well due to inflationary pressures and potential supply constraints. Maintain a positive outlook.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector (DIS, NFLX, EA) faces headwinds due to consumer spending concerns in a recessionary environment. Expect underperformance.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector (JPM, BAC, V, GS, BRK.B) is vulnerable to economic slowdown and rising interest rates. Expect underperformance and increased volatility.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector (JNJ, UNH, PFE) is considered a defensive sector and may offer some stability during economic uncertainty. Maintain a neutral to slightly positive outlook.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector (CAT, GE, LMT) is sensitive to economic cycles and may face reduced demand. Expect underperformance.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector (WMT, COST, HD) faces mixed prospects. Discount retailers may benefit from consumers seeking value, while discretionary retailers may struggle. Overall, a neutral outlook.",
    "TECH": "Technology sector (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA) is facing headwinds from slowing growth and higher interest rates. Expect continued volatility and potential underperformance.",
    "TRANSPORT": "The transport sector (BA) is expected to underperform due to economic slowdown."
