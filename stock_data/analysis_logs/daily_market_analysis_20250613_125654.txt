    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a mixed picture. High inflation and negative GDP growth indicate stagflation. Low unemployment is a positive, but market confidence is low. The Fed's target inflation rate is far from being met, suggesting continued monetary tightening. This environment favors defensive stocks and negatively impacts growth stocks.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to stagflation concerns. High volatility is expected to continue. Energy and healthcare sectors are likely to outperform, while technology and entertainment may underperform. Monitor upcoming economic data releases and policy announcements for potential shifts in sentiment.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to high inflation. Market sentiment is low due to low market confidence. Momentum is slightly negative, reflecting the economic slowdown. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Discretionary spending is likely to decline in a recessionary environment. NFLX and DIS may face challenges.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face headwinds from a slowing economy and potential credit losses. JPM, BAC, V, and GS are likely to experience volatility.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Healthcare is a defensive sector that tends to perform well during economic downturns. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are expected to be relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Manufacturing faces challenges from slowing global demand but benefits from infrastructure spending. CAT and GE are likely to be moderately affected.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Retail is sensitive to consumer spending, which is likely to decline. WMT, COST, and HD may experience slower growth.",
    "TECH": "Negative. High-growth tech stocks are vulnerable to rising interest rates and slowing economic growth. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are likely to underperform.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation is affected by both economic activity and supply chain issues. BA is likely to be volatile."
