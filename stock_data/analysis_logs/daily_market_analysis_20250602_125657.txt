    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Investors should be cautious and consider defensive positions. Energy sector may outperform due to inflation, while consumer discretionary and tech sectors may struggle.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative to reflect negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment is low, aligning with poor market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to the unemployment rate being near the natural rate. Long-term outlook is slightly decreased to reflect the current economic headwinds."

    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally defensive, but faces cost pressures.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Underperform. Economic slowdown and supply chain issues weigh on manufacturing.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Underperform. Retailers face challenges from inflation and changing consumer behavior.",
    "TECH": "Underperform. Tech companies are sensitive to interest rates and economic growth.",
