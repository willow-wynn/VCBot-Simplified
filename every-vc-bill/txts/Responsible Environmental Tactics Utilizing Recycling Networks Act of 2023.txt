S. 15
To create a federal recycling system for bottles and cans,
modeling the successful approach implemented by Denmark,
and to promote sustainability, waste reduction, and economic
opportunity.
IN THE SENATE
July 30, 2023
Mr. Clark (for himself, ) introduced the following bill, on behalf
of the Rosen Administration, as authored by President Rosen;
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,
A BILL

1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Responsible Environmental Tactics
Utilizing Recycling Networks Act" or the “RETURN Act”.
2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
2.1. FINDINGS.—
Congress finds the following:
(1) Plastic and aluminum waste is a significant contributor
to pollution and landfill overflows in the United States.
(2) Comprehensive, eective recycling systems can reduce
waste, decrease pollution, save resources, and contribute
to the creation of a circular economy.
(3) Denmark's bottle and can recycling system has achieved
a return rate of over 90%, demonstrating the ecacy of
deposit-refund systems in enhancing recycling rates.
(4) The introduction of a similar system in the United States
could not only improve recycling rates and promote
sustainability, but also provide a potential source of
income for economically disadvantaged individuals,
including those experiencing homelessness.
(5) Many individuals experiencing homelessness already
participate in informal recycling initiatives as a means of
income generation. A formal, nationwide deposit-refund
system could legitimize and expand these eorts,
providing a consistent source of income and
incentivizing participation in an important
environmental initiative.
