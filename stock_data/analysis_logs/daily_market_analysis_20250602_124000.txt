  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in the Public Square and Congress channels, indicating concerns about upcoming midterms and legislative actions. The News channel focuses on international tensions and White House turmoil, contributing to market uncertainty. Executive orders are being issued, but their impact is unclear. Overall, the Discord activity reflects a cautious and somewhat pessimistic market sentiment.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target, leading to increased volatility. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) signals a potential recession. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low at 35%, reflecting the overall economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely put downward pressure on stock prices. The low market confidence suggests investors are hesitant to take on risk. Expect continued volatility and potential for further declines in the short term. Sectors sensitive to economic downturns, such as finance and manufacturing, may underperform, while defensive sectors like energy and consumer staples could offer some resilience.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic downturn. Volatility is set to 0.85 to account for the high inflation rate and market uncertainty. Market sentiment is aligned with the low market confidence at 0.35. Momentum is set to 0.20, reflecting the slowing economic growth and slightly elevated unemployment. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.35 to reflect the increased uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply disruptions due to geopolitical tensions support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment may decline in a recessionary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and potential loan defaults due to economic slowdown could negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector and may outperform during economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing activity is likely to decline in a recession, impacting companies in this sector.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral. Consumer staples retailers may fare better than discretionary retailers, but overall retail spending is expected to slow.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies may face challenges due to slowing economic growth and potential cuts in corporate IT spending.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Reduced economic activity will likely lead to lower demand for transportation services."
