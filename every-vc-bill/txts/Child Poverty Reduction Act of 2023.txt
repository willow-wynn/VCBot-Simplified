the Census report on Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States.
That report, or companion reports, should include poverty statistics and thresholds for the
anchored Supplemental Poverty Measure and any other measures the Bureau of the Census
reports.
“(c) REPORTING IN RELATION TO THE TERRITORIES.—

subsection (a), not later than the close of fiscal year 2025.
“(2) REPORT REQUIRED IF COMPLIANCE IS NOT FEASIBLE.—If the
Secretary determines that it will not be feasible to comply with all or part of paragraph
(1), the Secretary shall submit to the Congress, not later than 6 months after the date of
the enactment of this section, a report that explains what is not feasible, why it is not
feasible, and includes details on what, if anything, would be needed to enable such
compliance and by what date compliance could be achieved.
“(3) LIMITATIONS ON AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—To carry

feasible, and includes details on what, if anything, would be needed to enable such
compliance and by what date compliance could be achieved.
“SEC. 443. CHILD POVERTY REPORTS.
“(a) ANNUAL REPORTS ON THE EFFECT OF FEDERAL POLICIES ON CHILD POVERTY IN THE
UNITED STATES.—Within 6 months after the date of the enactment of this section, the
Secretary shall enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to submit to
the Congress annual reports providing an evidence-based, non-partisan analysis of how
Federal policies or programs have contributed to meeting the goal set forth in section 441(a),
based on their effect on the anchored Supplemental Poverty Measure for children as
reported by the Bureau of the Census pursuant to section 442.
“(b) CONTENTS OF REPORTS.—
“(1) IN GENERAL.—Each such report—
“(A) shall analyze how, and the extent to which, Federal policies and
programs contribute to meeting the goal referred to in subsection (a) of this
section;
“(B) shall take into account the number of children in deep poverty and child
poverty among racial or ethnic groups with disparate poverty rates;
“(C) shall attempt to ascertain whether each studied policy or program
reduces or increases the number of children living in poverty, why the policy or
program does so, and the extent to which the policy or program does so; and
“(D) shall include, to the extent feasible, projections on how such policies or
programs would affect the number of children living in poverty in future years,

which shall be made on the basis of previously released Current Population
Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement data, and adjusted periodically
as new estimates from the Bureau of the Census become available.
“(2) DATA CORRECTIONS.—Where feasible, each such report shall correct the
underlying Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement data,
for under-reporting of income and in-kind benefits and shall include estimates using
both uncorrected and corrected income data. Because available information with which
to produce corrected income data is currently limited and not timely, each such report
shall indicate the year to which the corrected income data pertain and other limitations
of the data. As soon as corrected income data from the Census Bureau become
available under section 442(d), each such report shall use those data.

include an analysis of the additional policies.

of the United States Census Bureau on Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in
the United States for the year is released, and—

year that begins more than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this section; or
