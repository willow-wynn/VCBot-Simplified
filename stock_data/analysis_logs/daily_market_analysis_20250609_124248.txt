    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to decreased corporate earnings and lower stock prices. The low market confidence further reinforces this bearish outlook. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, aligning with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to the low unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly decreased to reflect the current economic challenges."

    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is negatively impacted by negative GDP growth and potential trade disruptions. CAT and GE face challenges.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector is sensitive to consumer spending and inflation. WMT and COST face mixed prospects, with potential for defensive positioning.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector faces headwinds from rising interest rates and potential regulation. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are likely to experience increased volatility.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector is impacted by economic slowdown and potential supply chain disruptions. BA and LMT face challenges, with LMT potentially more resilient due to defense spending."
