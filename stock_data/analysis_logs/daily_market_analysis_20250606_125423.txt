    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political campaigns and legislative actions, alongside executive decisions like vetoes. This indicates uncertainty and potential policy shifts, contributing to market volatility. The high message volume in Congress suggests active debate but also potential gridlock, further impacting investor confidence.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture: high inflation, negative GDP growth, and unemployment slightly above the natural rate. This stagflationary environment necessitates a cautious market approach. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major concern, and negative GDP growth suggests a potential recession.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to decreased corporate earnings and investor risk aversion. Expect increased volatility and a downward trend in the short term. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles (e.g., Finance, Manufacturing) will be particularly vulnerable.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high, reflecting the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting the unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the increased risk of recession."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector benefits from inflation and geopolitical instability, maintaining a positive outlook.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector faces challenges due to discretionary spending cuts amid economic slowdown, resulting in a negative outlook.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector is highly vulnerable to economic downturns and interest rate hikes, leading to a negative outlook.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector remains relatively stable due to its defensive nature, maintaining a neutral to slightly positive outlook.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is negatively impacted by decreased demand and supply chain disruptions, resulting in a negative outlook.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector faces challenges due to reduced consumer spending and inflation, leading to a negative outlook.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector experiences mixed performance, with some companies showing resilience while others struggle with growth, resulting in a neutral outlook.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector is affected by decreased economic activity and supply chain issues, leading to a negative outlook."
