STATUTORY NOTES AND RELATED SUBSIDIARIES
FINDINGS
Pub. L. 107–293, §1, Nov. 13, 2002, 116 Stat. 2057, provided that: "Congress finds the following:
"(1) On November 11, 1620, prior to embarking for the shores of America, the Pilgrims signed the
Mayflower Compact that declared: 'Having undertaken, for the Glory of God and the advancement of the
Christian Faith and honor of our King and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of
Virginia,'.
"(2) On July 4, 1776, America's Founding Fathers, after appealing to the 'Laws of Nature, and of
Nature's God' to justify their separation from Great Britain, then declared: 'We hold these Truths to be
self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness'.
"(3) In 1781, Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence and later the Nation's
third President, in his work titled 'Notes on the State of Virginia' wrote: 'God who gave us life gave us
liberty. And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a
conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the Gift of God. That they are not to be
violated but with His wrath? Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; that his justice
cannot sleep forever.'
"(4) On May 14, 1787, George Washington, as President of the Constitutional Convention, rose to
admonish and exhort the delegates and declared: 'If to please the people we offer what we ourselves
[Release Point 118-106]
disapprove, how can we afterward defend our work? Let us raise a standard to which the wise and the
honest can repair; the event is in the hand of God!'
"(5) On July 21, 1789, on the same day that it approved the Establishment Clause concerning religion,
the First Congress of the United States also passed the Northwest Ordinance, providing for a territorial
government for lands northwest of the Ohio River, which declared: 'Religion, morality, and knowledge,
being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education
shall forever be encouraged.'
"(6) On September 25, 1789, the First Congress unanimously approved a resolution calling on
President George Washington to proclaim a National Day of Thanksgiving for the people of the United
States by declaring, 'a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging, with
grateful hearts, the many signal favors of Almighty God, especially by affording them an opportunity
peaceably to establish a constitution of government for their safety and happiness.'
"(7) On November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg Address on the site
of the battle and declared: 'It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that
from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure
of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this Nation, under
God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that Government of the people, by the people, for the people,
shall not perish from the earth.'
"(8) On April 28, 1952, in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Zorach v.
Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), in which school children were allowed to be excused from public schools for
religious observances and education, Justice William O. Douglas, in writing for the Court stated: 'The First
Amendment, however, does not say that in every and all respects there shall be a separation of Church and
State. Rather, it studiously defines the manner, the specific ways, in which there shall be no concern or
union or dependency one on the other. That is the common sense of the matter. Otherwise the State and
religion would be aliens to each other—hostile, suspicious, and even unfriendly. Churches could not be
required to pay even property taxes. Municipalities would not be permitted to render police or fire
protection to religious groups. Policemen who helped parishioners into their places of worship would
violate the Constitution. Prayers in our legislative halls; the appeals to the Almighty in the messages of the
Chief Executive; the proclamations making Thanksgiving Day a holiday; "so help me God" in our
courtroom oaths—these and all other references to the Almighty that run through our laws, our public
rituals, our ceremonies would be flouting the First Amendment. A fastidious atheist or agnostic could even
object to the supplication with which the Court opens each session: "God save the United States and this
Honorable Court." '
"(9) On June 15, 1954, Congress passed and President Eisenhower signed into law a statute that was
clearly consistent with the text and intent of the Constitution of the United States, that amended the Pledge
of Allegiance to read: 'I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic
for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'
"(10) On July 20, 1956, Congress proclaimed that the national motto of the United States is 'In God
We Trust', and that motto is inscribed above the main door of the Senate, behind the Chair of the Speaker of
the House of Representatives, and on the currency of the United States.
"(11) On June 17, 1963, in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Abington School
District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963), in which compulsory school prayer was held unconstitutional,
Justices Goldberg and Harlan, concurring in the decision, stated: 'But untutored devotion to the concept of
neutrality can lead to invocation or approval of results which partake not simply of that noninterference and
noninvolvement with the religious which the Constitution commands, but of a brooding and pervasive
devotion to the secular and a passive, or even active, hostility to the religious. Such results are not only not
compelled by the Constitution, but, it seems to me, are prohibited by it. Neither government nor this Court
can or should ignore the significance of the fact that a vast portion of our people believe in and worship
God and that many of our legal, political, and personal values derive historically from religious teachings.
Government must inevitably take cognizance of the existence of religion and, indeed, under certain
circumstances the First Amendment may require that it do so.'
"(12) On March 5, 1984, in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Lynch v.
Donelly, 465 U.S. 668 (1984), in which a city government's display of a nativity scene was held to be
constitutional, Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, stated: 'There is an unbroken history of official
acknowledgment by all three branches of government of the role of religion in American life from at least
1789 . . . [E]xamples of reference to our religious heritage are found in the statutorily prescribed national
motto "In God We Trust" (36 U.S.C. 186) [now 36 U.S.C. 302], which Congress and the President
mandated for our currency, see (31 U.S.C. 5112(d)(1) (1982 ed.)), and in the language "One Nation under
[Release Point 118-106]
God", as part of the Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag. That pledge is recited by many thousands of
public school children—and adults—every year . . . Art galleries supported by public revenues display
religious paintings of the 15th and 16th centuries, predominantly inspired by one religious faith. The
National Gallery in Washington, maintained with Government support, for example, has long exhibited
masterpieces with religious messages, notably the Last Supper, and paintings depicting the Birth of Christ,
the Crucifixion, and the Resurrection, among many others with explicit Christian themes and messages. The
very chamber in which oral arguments on this case were heard is decorated with a notable and
permanent—not seasonal—symbol of religion: Moses with the Ten Commandments. Congress has long
provided chapels in the Capitol for religious worship and meditation.'
"(13) On June 4, 1985, in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Wallace v. Jaffree,
472 U.S. 38 (1985), in which a mandatory moment of silence to be used for meditation or voluntary prayer
was held unconstitutional, Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment and addressing the contention that
the Court's holding would render the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional because Congress amended it in
1954 to add the words 'under God,' stated 'In my view, the words "under God" in the Pledge, as codified at
(36 U.S.C. 172) [now 4 U.S.C. 4], serve as an acknowledgment of religion with "the legitimate secular
purposes of solemnizing public occasions, [and] expressing confidence in the future." '
"(14) On November 20, 1992, the United States Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, in Sherman v.
Community Consolidated School District 21, 980 F.2d 437 (7th Cir. 1992), held that a school district's
policy for voluntary recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance including the words 'under God' was
constitutional.
"(15) The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals erroneously held, in Newdow v. U.S. Congress (9th Cir. June
26, 2002), that the Pledge of Allegiance's use of the express religious reference 'under God' violates the
First Amendment to the Constitution, and that, therefore, a school district's policy and practice of
teacher-led voluntary recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional.
"(16) The erroneous rationale of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Newdow would lead to the absurd
result that the Constitution's use of the express religious reference 'Year of our Lord' in Article VII violates
the First Amendment to the Constitution, and that, therefore, a school district's policy and practice of
teacher-led voluntary recitations of the Constitution itself would be unconstitutional."
REAFFIRMATION OF LANGUAGE
Pub. L. 107–293, §2(b), Nov. 13, 2002, 116 Stat. 2060, provided that: "In codifying this subsection
[probably should be "section", meaning section 2 of Pub. L. 107–293, which amended this section], the Office
of the Law Revision Counsel shall show in the historical and statutory notes that the 107th Congress
reaffirmed the exact language that has appeared in the Pledge for decades."
§5. Display and use of flag by civilians; codification of rules and customs;
definition
The following codification of existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the
flag of the United States of America is established for the use of such civilians or civilian groups or
organizations as may not be required to conform with regulations promulgated by one or more

§7. Position and manner of display
The flag, when carried in a procession with another flag or flags, should be either on the marching
right; that is, the flag's own right, or, if there is a line of other flags, in front of the center of that line.
(a) The flag should not be displayed on a float in a parade except from a staff, or as provided in
subsection (i) of this section.
(b) The flag should not be draped over the hood, top, sides, or back of a vehicle or of a railroad
train or a boat. When the flag is displayed on a motorcar, the staff shall be fixed firmly to the chassis
or clamped to the right fender.
(c) No other flag or pennant should be placed above or, if on the same level, to the right of the flag
of the United States of America, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains at sea,
when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services for the personnel of the
Navy. No person shall display the flag of the United Nations or any other national or international
flag equal, above, or in a position of superior prominence or honor to, or in place of, the flag of the
United States at any place within the United States or any Territory or possession thereof: Provided,
That nothing in this section shall make unlawful the continuance of the practice heretofore followed
[Release Point 118-106]
of displaying the flag of the United Nations in a position of superior prominence or honor, and other
national flags in positions of equal prominence or honor, with that of the flag of the United States at
the headquarters of the United Nations.
(d) The flag of the United States of America, when it is displayed with another flag against a wall
from crossed staffs, should be on the right, the flag's own right, and its staff should be in front of the
staff of the other flag.
(e) The flag of the United States of America should be at the center and at the highest point of the
group when a number of flags of States or localities or pennants of societies are grouped and
displayed from staffs.
(f) When flags of States, cities, or localities, or pennants of societies are flown on the same
halyard with the flag of the United States, the latter should always be at the peak. When the flags are
flown from adjacent staffs, the flag of the United States should be hoisted first and lowered last. No
such flag or pennant may be placed above the flag of the United States or to the United States flag's
right.
(g) When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to be flown from separate staffs of
the same height. The flags should be of approximately equal size. International usage forbids the
display of the flag of one nation above that of another nation in time of peace.
(h) When the flag of the United States is displayed from a staff projecting horizontally or at an
angle from the window sill, balcony, or front of a building, the union of the flag should be placed at
the peak of the staff unless the flag is at half-staff. When the flag is suspended over a sidewalk from
a rope extending from a house to a pole at the edge of the sidewalk, the flag should be hoisted out,
union first, from the building.
(i) When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost
and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left. When displayed in a window, the flag should
be displayed in the same way, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street.
(j) When the flag is displayed over the middle of the street, it should be suspended vertically with
the union to the north in an east and west street or to the east in a north and south street.
(k) When used on a speaker's platform, the flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed above and
behind the speaker. When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, the flag of the
United States of America should hold the position of superior prominence, in advance of the
audience, and in the position of honor at the clergyman's or speaker's right as he faces the audience.
Any other flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of
the audience.
(l) The flag should form a distinctive feature of the ceremony of unveiling a statue or monument,
but it should never be used as the covering for the statue or monument.
(m) The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the peak for an instant and then
lowered to the half-staff position. The flag should be again raised to the peak before it is lowered for
the day. On Memorial Day the flag should be displayed at half-staff until noon only, then raised to
the top of the staff. By order of the President, the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the death of
principal figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a State, territory, or
possession, as a mark of respect to their memory. In the event of the death of other officials or
foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential instructions or
orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law. In the event
of the death of a present or former official of the government of any State, territory, or possession of
the United States, the death of a member of the Armed Forces from any State, territory, or possession
who dies while serving on active duty, or the death of a first responder working in any State,
territory, or possession who dies while serving in the line of duty, the Governor of that State,
territory, or possession may proclaim that the National flag shall be flown at half-staff, and the same
authority is provided to the Mayor of the District of Columbia with respect to present or former
officials of the District of Columbia, members of the Armed Forces from the District of Columbia,
and first responders working in the District of Columbia. When the Governor of a State, territory, or
possession, or the Mayor of the District of Columbia, issues a proclamation under the preceding
sentence that the National flag be flown at half-staff in that State, territory, or possession or in the
[Release Point 118-106]
District of Columbia because of the death of a member of the Armed Forces, the National flag flown
at any Federal installation or facility in the area covered by that proclamation shall be flown at
half-staff consistent with that proclamation. The flag shall be flown at half-staff 30 days from the
death of the President or a former President; 10 days from the day of death of the Vice President, the
Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice of the United States, or the Speaker of the House of
Representatives; from the day of death until interment of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,
a Secretary of an executive or military department, a former Vice President, or the Governor of a
State, territory, or possession; and on the day of death and the following day for a Member of
Congress. The flag shall be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day, unless that day is
also Armed Forces Day. As used in this subsection—
(1) the term "half-staff" means the position of the flag when it is one-half the distance between
the top and bottom of the staff;
(2) the term "executive or military department" means any agency listed under sections 101 and
102 of title 5;
(3) the term "Member of Congress" means a Senator, a Representative, a Delegate, or the
Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico; and
(4) the term "first responder" means a "public safety officer" as defined in section 1204 of title I
of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10284).
(n) When the flag is used to cover a casket, it should be so placed that the union is at the head and
over the left shoulder. The flag should not be lowered into the grave or allowed to touch the ground.
(o) When the flag is suspended across a corridor or lobby in a building with only one main
entrance, it should be suspended vertically with the union of the flag to the observer's left upon
entering. If the building has more than one main entrance, the flag should be suspended vertically
near the center of the corridor or lobby with the union to the north, when entrances are to the east and
west or to the east when entrances are to the north and south. If there are entrances in more than two
directions, the union should be to the east.

[SEAL]
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER.
§8. Respect for flag
No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be
dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags
are to be dipped as a mark of honor.
(a) The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in
instances of extreme danger to life or property.
(b) The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or
merchandise.
(c) The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.
(d) The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be
festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and
red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used
for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general.
(e) The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to
be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.
(f) The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.
(g) The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark,
insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.
(h) The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering
anything.
(i) The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not
be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise
impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard.
Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.
(j) No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch
may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic
organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore,
the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.
(k) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should
be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.

any plan, program, or arrangement that is in writing, that provides for retirement payments in
recognition of prior service to be made to a retired partner, and that is in effect immediately
before retirement begins), if such income—
(i) is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than
annually which may include income described in subparagraphs (A) through (H)) made for—

any other limitation on contributions or benefits in such Code on plans to which any of such
sections apply.
The fact that payments may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to such plan, program, or
arrangement to limit total disbursements under a predetermined formula, or to provide cost of
living or similar adjustments, will not cause the periodic payments provided under such plan,
program, or arrangement to fail the "substantially equal periodic payments" test.
Such term includes any retired or retainer pay of a member or former member of a uniform service
computed under chapter 71 of title 10, United States Code.

(a) APPLICATION OF THIS SECTION THROUGH SECTION 126.—This section through 1
126 of this title apply to any tax, charge, or fee levied by a taxing jurisdiction as a fixed charge for
each customer or measured by gross amounts charged to customers for mobile telecommunications
services, regardless of whether such tax, charge, or fee is imposed on the vendor or customer of the
service and regardless of the terminology used to describe the tax, charge, or fee.
(b) GENERAL EXCEPTIONS.—This section through 1 126 of this title do not apply to—
(1) any tax, charge, or fee levied upon or measured by the net income, capital stock, net worth,
or property value of the provider of mobile telecommunications service;
(2) any tax, charge, or fee that is applied to an equitably apportioned amount that is not
determined on a transactional basis;
(3) any tax, charge, or fee that represents compensation for a mobile telecommunications
service provider's use of public rights of way or other public property, provided that such tax,
charge, or fee is not levied by the taxing jurisdiction as a fixed charge for each customer or
measured by gross amounts charged to customers for mobile telecommunication services;
(4) any generally applicable business and occupation tax that is imposed by a State, is applied to
gross receipts or gross proceeds, is the legal liability of the home service provider, and that
statutorily allows the home service provider to elect to use the sourcing method required in this
section through 1 126 of this title;

subsequent resale of such services, whether as sales of such services alone or as a part of a
bundled product, if the Internet Tax Freedom Act would preclude a taxing jurisdiction from
subjecting the charges of the sale of such services to a tax, charge, or fee, but this section provides
no evidence of the intent of Congress with respect to the applicability of the Internet Tax Freedom
Act to such charges; and
(3) do not apply to the determination of the taxing situs of air-ground radiotelephone service as
defined in section 22.99 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations as in effect on June 1, 1999.

§119. Electronic databases for nationwide standard numeric jurisdictional codes
(a) ELECTRONIC DATABASE.—
(1) PROVISION OF DATABASE.—A State may provide an electronic database to a home
service provider or, if a State does not provide such an electronic database to home service
providers, then the designated database provider may provide an electronic database to a home
service provider.
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) FORMAT.—(A) Such electronic database, whether provided by the State or the designated
database provider, shall be provided in a format approved by the American National Standards
Institute's Accredited Standards Committee X12, that, allowing for de minimis deviations,
designates for each street address in the State, including to the extent practicable, any multiple
postal street addresses applicable to one street location, the appropriate taxing jurisdictions, and
the appropriate code for each taxing jurisdiction, for each level of taxing jurisdiction, identified by
one nationwide standard numeric code.
(B) Such electronic database shall also provide the appropriate code for each street address with
respect to political subdivisions which are not taxing jurisdictions when reasonably needed to
determine the proper taxing jurisdiction.
(C) The nationwide standard numeric codes shall contain the same number of numeric digits
with each digit or combination of digits referring to the same level of taxing jurisdiction
throughout the United States using a format similar to FIPS 55–3 or other appropriate standard
approved by the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission, or their
successors. Each address shall be provided in standard postal format.
(b) NOTICE; UPDATES.—A State or designated database provider that provides or maintains an
electronic database described in subsection (a) shall provide notice of the availability of the then
current electronic database, and any subsequent revisions thereof, by publication in the manner
normally employed for the publication of informational tax, charge, or fee notices to taxpayers in
such State.
(c) USER HELD HARMLESS.—A home service provider using the data contained in an
electronic database described in subsection (a) shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee
liability that otherwise would be due solely as a result of any error or omission in such database
provided by a State or designated database provider. The home service provider shall reflect changes
made to such database during a calendar quarter not later than 30 days after the end of such calendar
quarter for each State that issues notice of the availability of an electronic database reflecting such
changes under subsection (b).

§120. Procedure if no electronic database provided
(a) SAFE HARBOR.—If neither a State nor designated database provider provides an electronic
database under section 119, a home service provider shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or
fee liability in such State that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street
address to an incorrect taxing jurisdiction if, subject to section 121, the home service provider
employs an enhanced zip code to assign each street address to a specific taxing jurisdiction for each
level of taxing jurisdiction and exercises due diligence at each level of taxing jurisdiction to ensure
that each such street address is assigned to the correct taxing jurisdiction. If an enhanced zip code
overlaps boundaries of taxing jurisdictions of the same level, the home service provider must
designate one specific jurisdiction within such enhanced zip code for use in taxing the activity for
such enhanced zip code for each level of taxing jurisdiction. Any enhanced zip code assignment
changed in accordance with section 121 is deemed to be in compliance with this section. For
purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a home service provider has exercised
due diligence if such home service provider demonstrates that it has—
(1) expended reasonable resources to implement and maintain an appropriately detailed
[Release Point 118-106]
electronic database of street address assignments to taxing jurisdictions;
(2) implemented and maintained reasonable internal controls to promptly correct
misassignments of street addresses to taxing jurisdictions; and
(3) used all reasonably obtainable and usable data pertaining to municipal annexations,
incorporations, reorganizations and any other changes in jurisdictional boundaries that materially
affect the accuracy of such database.
(b) TERMINATION OF SAFE HARBOR.—Subsection (a) applies to a home service provider
that is in compliance with the requirements of subsection (a), with respect to a State for which an
electronic database is not provided under section 119 until the later of—
(1) 18 months after the nationwide standard numeric code described in section 119(a) has been
approved by the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission; or
(2) 6 months after such State or a designated database provider in such State provides such
database as prescribed in section 119(a).

§121. Correction of erroneous data for place of primary use
(a) 1 IN GENERAL.—A taxing jurisdiction, or a State on behalf of any taxing jurisdiction or
taxing jurisdictions within such State, may—
(1) determine that the address used for purposes of determining the taxing jurisdictions to which
taxes, charges, or fees for mobile telecommunications services are remitted does not meet the
definition of place of primary use in section 124(8) and give binding notice to the home service
provider to change the place of primary use on a prospective basis from the date of notice of
determination if—
(A) if the taxing jurisdiction making such determination is not a State, such taxing
jurisdiction obtains the consent of all affected taxing jurisdictions within the State before giving
such notice of determination; and
(B) before the taxing jurisdiction gives such notice of determination, the customer is given an
opportunity to demonstrate in accordance with applicable State or local tax, charge, or fee
administrative procedures that the address is the customer's place of primary use;
(2) determine that the assignment of a taxing jurisdiction by a home service provider under
section 120 does not reflect the correct taxing jurisdiction and give binding notice to the home
service provider to change the assignment on a prospective basis from the date of notice of
determination if—
(A) if the taxing jurisdiction making such determination is not a State, such taxing
jurisdiction obtains the consent of all affected taxing jurisdictions within the State before giving
such notice of determination; and
(B) the home service provider is given an opportunity to demonstrate in accordance with
applicable State or local tax, charge, or fee administrative procedures that the assignment
reflects the correct taxing jurisdiction.

supplied by the home service provider's customer; and
(2) not hold a home service provider liable for any additional taxes, charges, or fees based on a
different determination of the place of primary use for taxes, charges, or fees that are customarily
passed on to the customer as a separate itemized charge.

mobile telecommunications services may be subject to taxation unless the home service provider can

(c) NONTAXABLE CHARGES.—If a taxing jurisdiction does not subject charges for mobile
telecommunications services to taxation, a customer may not rely upon the nontaxability of charges
for mobile telecommunications services unless the customer's home service provider separately
states the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services from taxable charges or the
home service provider elects, after receiving a written request from the customer in the form required
by the provider, to provide verifiable data based upon the home service provider's books and records
that are kept in the regular course of business that reasonably identifies the nontaxable charges.
