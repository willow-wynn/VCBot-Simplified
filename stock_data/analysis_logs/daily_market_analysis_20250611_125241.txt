    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of concerns and skepticism, with some users questioning the validity of information. The high message volume in the Public Square suggests widespread uncertainty. Executive channel activity indicates potential policy shifts, while Congress channel activity reflects legislative actions. Overall, Discord activity suggests a cautious market sentiment.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target of 2.0%, leading to increased volatility. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates a potential recession. Unemployment is low (3.2%), but still within the natural rate range (3.5-4.0%). These factors contribute to a negative trend direction and overall market uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish in the short term. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely put downward pressure on stock prices. Market confidence is low, further exacerbating the negative sentiment. Expect increased volatility and potential for further declines.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction is set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and economic momentum. volatility is set to 1.10 to reflect the high inflation rate. market_sentiment is set to 0.35 to align with the low market confidence. momentum is set to 0.25 to reflect the weak economic growth. long_term_outlook is slightly adjusted to 0.41 to account for potential future improvements."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to persistent inflation and supply constraints.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook due to consumer spending contraction.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative outlook due to interest rate hikes and potential loan defaults.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral outlook, relatively stable but sensitive to policy changes.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Slightly negative outlook due to supply chain issues and decreased demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative outlook due to inflation impacting consumer spending.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to slightly negative outlook, sensitive to interest rates and consumer spending.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral outlook, impacted by both energy prices and manufacturing output."
