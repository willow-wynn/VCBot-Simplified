    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress, suggesting focus on policy.

    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Low unemployment is a positive, but it's within the natural rate range, offering limited comfort. Market confidence is very low, reflecting the economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment, the market is expected to be bearish in the short term. High volatility is anticipated due to inflation concerns. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, assuming eventual policy adjustments to address inflation and stimulate growth.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high, reflecting inflation. Market sentiment is low, mirroring confidence. Momentum is reduced due to economic slowdown. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced, reflecting the current economic strain."

    "HEALTH": "Relatively stable outlook, as healthcare is generally less sensitive to economic cycles.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook due to potential decrease in demand and supply chain issues.",
    "RETAIL": "Mixed outlook, with discount retailers potentially benefiting from consumers seeking cheaper options.",
    "TECH": "Cautiously negative outlook, as growth stocks may be affected by rising interest rates.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative outlook due to decreased economic activity and potential fuel cost increases."
