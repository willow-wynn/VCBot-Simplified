IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED

SEPTEMBER 14, 2021
Mr. DAVID MILLER of Georgia (for himself, Mr. LIGHTWOOD-TOWARD, Mr. SULLIVAN) introduced
the following bill:
⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
A BILL
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the age limit on opening an Achieving
a Better Life Experience account, and for other purposes.
Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the “Achieving a Better Life Experience Eligibility Expansion
Act of 2021” or the “ABLE Eligibility Expansion Act of 2021”.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that:
(1) In 2014, then-President Obama signed the Stephen Beck, Jr., Achieving a Better
Life Experience (ABLE) Act, which allowed States to create tax-advantaged
savings programs for eligible people with disabilities.
(2) Typically, the cap on adding contributions in an ABLE account for a taxable year
is limited to the federal gift tax exclusion for such taxable year, which is currently
$15,000.
(3) A few years after the enactment of the ABLE Act, an amendment was passed
limiting eligibility for creating an ABLE account to individuals that had a
disability or blindness occur before age 26, and they must be eligible for
Supplemental Security Income.

(4) The age 26 limitation puts millions of Americans at a disadvantage, as many have
been overcome with a disability after age 26.
SEC. 3. INCREASE OF AGE LIMIT FOR OPENING AN ABLE ACCOUNT.
Section 529A(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking “age 26”
each place it appears in paragraphs (1)(A) and (2)(A)(i)(II) and inserting “age 46”.
SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.
The amendments made by section 3 shall apply to taxable years beginning after the date
of the enactment of this Act.
