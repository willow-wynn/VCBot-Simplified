An "anonymous work" is a work on the copies or phonorecords of which no natural person is
identified as author.
An "architectural work" is the design of a building as embodied in any tangible medium of
expression, including a building, architectural plans, or drawings. The work includes the overall
form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design, but does
not include individual standard features.
"Audiovisual works" are works that consist of a series of related images which are intrinsically
intended to be shown by the use of machines, or devices such as projectors, viewers, or electronic
equipment, together with accompanying sounds, if any, regardless of the nature of the material
objects, such as films or tapes, in which the works are embodied.
The "Berne Convention" is the Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,
signed at Berne, Switzerland, on September 9, 1886, and all acts, protocols, and revisions thereto.

children legally adopted by that person.
A "collective work" is a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a
number of contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
assembled into a collective whole.
A "compilation" is a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or
of data that are selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole

A "computer program" is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a
computer in order to bring about a certain result.

each version constitutes a separate work.
A "derivative work" is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation,
musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art
reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast,

The term "financial gain" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything of value,
including the receipt of other copyrighted works.
A work is "fixed" in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment in a copy or
phonorecord, by or under the authority of the author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit
it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory

purposes of this title if a fixation of the work is being made simultaneously with its transmission.
A "food service or drinking establishment" is a restaurant, inn, bar, tavern, or any other similar
place of business in which the public or patrons assemble for the primary purpose of being served
food or drink, in which the majority of the gross square feet of space that is nonresidential is used

other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such
as books, periodicals, manuscripts, phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are
embodied.
The term "motion picture exhibition facility" means a movie theater, screening room, or other
venue that is being used primarily for the exhibition of a copyrighted motion picture, if such
exhibition is open to the public or is made to an assembled group of viewers outside of a normal
circle of a family and its social acquaintances.
"Motion pictures" are audiovisual works consisting of a series of related images which, when
shown in succession, impart an impression of motion, together with accompanying sounds, if any.
To "perform" a work means to recite, render, play, dance, or act it, either directly or by means
of any device or process or, in the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to show its
images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.
A "performing rights society" is an association, corporation, or other entity that licenses the

works of artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects
are concerned; the design of a useful article, as defined in this section, shall be considered a
pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates
pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of
existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.
For purposes of section 513, a "proprietor" is an individual, corporation, partnership, or other
entity, as the case may be, that owns an establishment or a food service or drinking establishment,
except that no owner or operator of a radio or television station licensed by the Federal
Communications Commission, cable system or satellite carrier, cable or satellite carrier service or
programmer, provider of online services or network access or the operator of facilities therefor,
telecommunications company, or any other such audio or audiovisual service or programmer now

identified under a fictitious name.
"Publication" is the distribution of copies or phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or
other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending. The offering to distribute copies or
phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution, public performance, or
public display, constitutes publication. A public performance or display of a work does not of
itself constitute publication.
To perform or display a work "publicly" means—
(1) to perform or display it at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial
number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is
gathered; or
(2) to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to a place
specified by clause (1) or to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the
members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same
place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.
"Registration", for purposes of sections 205(c)(2), 405, 406, 410(d), 411, 412, and 506(e),
means a registration of a claim in the original or the renewed and extended term of copyright.
"Sound recordings" are works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or
other sounds, but not including the sounds accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual
work, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as disks, tapes, or other phonorecords,
in which they are embodied.
"State" includes the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any
territories to which this title is made applicable by an Act of Congress.
A "transfer of copyright ownership" is an assignment, mortgage, exclusive license, or any other
conveyance, alienation, or hypothecation of a copyright or of any of the exclusive rights
comprised in a copyright, whether or not it is limited in time or place of effect, but not including a
nonexclusive license.
A "transmission program" is a body of material that, as an aggregate, has been produced for the
sole purpose of transmission to the public in sequence and as a unit.
To "transmit" a performance or display is to communicate it by any device or process whereby
images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they are sent.
A "treaty party" is a country or intergovernmental organization other than the United States that

of the Work Made For Hire and Copyright Corrections Act of 2000 and section 1011(d) of the
Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999, as enacted by section
1000(a)(9) of Public Law 106–113, were never enacted, and without regard to any inaction or

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
[Release Point 118-106]
Original Works of Authorship. The two fundamental criteria of copyright protection—originality and
fixation in tangible form are restated in the first sentence of this cornerstone provision. The phrase "original
works or authorship," which is purposely left undefined, is intended to incorporate without change the
standard of originality established by the courts under the present copyright statute. This standard does not
include requirements of novelty, ingenuity, or esthetic merit, and there is no intention to enlarge the standard
of copyright protection to require them.
In using the phrase "original works of authorship," rather than "all the writings of an author" now in section
4 of the statute [section 4 of former title 17], the committee's purpose is to avoid exhausting the constitutional
power of Congress to legislate in this field, and to eliminate the uncertainties arising from the latter phrase.
Since the present statutory language is substantially the same as the empowering language of the Constitution
[Const. Art. I, §8, cl. 8], a recurring question has been whether the statutory and the constitutional provisions
are coextensive. If so, the courts would be faced with the alternative of holding copyrightable something that
Congress clearly did not intend to protect, or of holding constitutionally incapable of copyright something that
Congress might one day want to protect. To avoid these equally undesirable results, the courts have indicated
that "all the writings of an author" under the present statute is narrower in scope than the "writings" of
"authors" referred to in the Constitution. The bill avoids this dilemma by using a different phrase—"original
works of authorship"—in characterizing the general subject matter of statutory copyright protection.
The history of copyright law has been one of gradual expansion in the types of works accorded protection,
and the subject matter affected by this expansion has fallen into two general categories. In the first, scientific
discoveries and technological developments have made possible new forms of creative expression that never
existed before. In some of these cases the new expressive forms—electronic music, filmstrips, and computer
programs, for example—could be regarded as an extension of copyrightable subject matter Congress had
already intended to protect, and were thus considered copyrightable from the outset without the need of new
legislation. In other cases, such as photographs, sound recordings, and motion pictures, statutory enactment
was deemed necessary to give them full recognition as copyrightable works.
Authors are continually finding new ways of expressing themselves, but it is impossible to foresee the
forms that these new expressive methods will take. The bill does not intend either to freeze the scope of
copyrightable subject matter at the present stage of communications technology or to allow unlimited
expansion into areas completely outside the present congressional intent. Section 102 implies neither that that
subject matter is unlimited nor that new forms of expression within that general area of subject matter would
necessarily be unprotected.
The historic expansion of copyright has also applied to forms of expression which, although in existence for
generations or centuries, have only gradually come to be recognized as creative and worthy of protection. The
first copyright statute in this country, enacted in 1790, designated only "maps, charts, and books"; major forms
of expression such as music, drama, and works of art achieved specific statutory recognition only in later
enactments. Although the coverage of the present statute is very broad, and would be broadened further by the
explicit recognition of all forms of choreography, there are unquestionably other areas of existing subject
matter that this bill does not propose to protect but that future Congresses may want to.
Fixation in Tangible Form. As a basic condition of copyright protection, the bill perpetuates the existing
requirement that a work be fixed in a "tangible medium of expression," and adds that this medium may be one
"now known or later developed," and that the fixation is sufficient if the work "can be perceived, reproduced,
or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device." This broad language is
intended to avoid the artificial and largely unjustifiable distinctions, derived from cases such as White-Smith
Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co., 209 U.S. 1 (1908) [28 S.Ct. 319, 52 L.Ed. 655], under which statutory
copyrightability in certain cases has been made to depend upon the form or medium in which the work is
fixed. Under the bill it makes no difference what the form, manner, or medium of fixation may be—whether it
is in words, numbers, notes, sounds, pictures, or any other graphic or symbolic indicia, whether embodied in a
physical object in written, printed, photographic, sculptural, punched, magnetic, or any other stable form, and
whether it is capable of perception directly or by means of any machine or device "now known or later
developed."
Under the bill, the concept of fixation is important since it not only determines whether the provisions of
the statute apply to a work, but it also represents the dividing line between common law and statutory
protection. As will be noted in more detail in connection with section 301, an unfixed work of authorship,
such as an improvisation or an unrecorded choreographic work, performance, or broadcast, would continue to
be subject to protection under State common law or statute, but would not be eligible for Federal statutory
protection under section 102.
The bill seeks to resolve, through the definition of "fixation" in section 101, the status of live
broadcasts—sports, news coverage, live performances of music, etc.—that are reaching the public in unfixed
[Release Point 118-106]
form but that are simultaneously being recorded. When a football game is being covered by four television
cameras, with a director guiding the activities of the four cameramen and choosing which of their electronic
images are sent out to the public and in what order, there is little doubt that what the cameramen and the
director are doing constitutes "authorship." The further question to be considered is whether there has been a
fixation. If the images and sounds to be broadcast are first recorded (on a video tape, film, etc.) and then
transmitted, the recorded work would be considered a "motion picture" subject to statutory protection against
unauthorized reproduction or retransmission of the broadcast. If the program content is transmitted live to the
public while being recorded at the same time, the case would be treated the same; the copyright owner would
not be forced to rely on common law rather than statutory rights in proceeding against an infringing user of
the live broadcast.
Thus, assuming it is copyrightable—as a "motion picture" or "sound recording," for example—the content
of a live transmission should be regarded as fixed and should be accorded statutory protection if it is being
recorded simultaneously with its transmission. On the other hand, the definition of "fixation" would exclude
from the concept purely evanescent or transient reproductions such as those projected briefly on a screen,
shown electronically on a television or other cathode ray tube, or captured momentarily in the "memory" of a
computer.
Under the first sentence of the definition of "fixed" in section 101, a work would be considered "fixed in a
tangible medium of expression" if there has been an authorized embodiment in a copy or phonorecord and if
that embodiment "is sufficiently permanent or stable" to permit the work "to be perceived, reproduced, or
otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration." The second sentence makes clear that,
in the case of "a work consisting of sounds, images, or both, that are being transmitted," the work is regarded
as "fixed" if a fixation is being made at the same time as the transmission.
Under this definition "copies" and "phonorecords" together will comprise all of the material objects in
which copyrightable works are capable of being fixed. The definitions of these terms in section 101, together
with their usage in section 102 and throughout the bill, reflect a fundamental distinction between the "original
work" which is the product of "authorship" and the multitude of material objects in which it can be embodied.
Thus, in the sense of the bill, a "book" is not a work of authorship, but is a particular kind of "copy." Instead,
the author may write a "literary work," which in turn can be embodied in a wide range of "copies" and
"phonorecords," including books, periodicals, computer punch cards, microfilm, tape recordings, and so forth.
It is possible to have an "original work of authorship" without having a "copy" or "phonorecord" embodying
it, and it is also possible to have a "copy" or "phonorecord" embodying something that does not qualify as an
"original work of authorship." The two essential elements—original work and tangible object—must merge
through fixation in order to produce subject matter copyrightable under the statute.
Categories of Copyrightable Works. The second sentence of section 102 lists seven broad categories
which the concept of "works of authorship" is said to "include". The use of the word "include," as defined in
section 101, makes clear that the listing is "illustrative and not limitative," and that the seven categories do not
necessarily exhaust the scope of "original works of authorship" that the bill is intended to protect. Rather, the
list sets out the general area of copyrightable subject matter, but with sufficient flexibility to free the courts
from rigid or outmoded concepts of the scope of particular categories. The items are also overlapping in the
sense that a work falling within one class may encompass works coming within some or all of the other
categories. In the aggregate, the list covers all classes of works now specified in section 5 of title 17 [section 5
of former title 17]; in addition, it specifically enumerates "pantomimes and choreographic works".
Of the seven items listed, four are defined in section 101. The three undefined categories—"musical
works," "dramatic works," and "pantomimes and choreographic works"—have fairly settled meanings. There
is no need, for example, to specify the copyrightability of electronic or concrete music in the statute since the
form of a work would no longer be of any importance, nor is it necessary to specify that "choreographic
works" do not include social dance steps and simple routines.
The four items defined in section 101 are "literary works," "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works,"
"motion pictures and audiovisual works", and "sound recordings". In each of these cases, definitions are
needed not only because the meaning of the term itself is unsettled but also because the distinction between
"work" and "material object" requires clarification. The term "literary works" does not connote any criterion
of literary merit or qualitative value: it includes catalogs, directories, and similar factual, reference, or
instructional works and compilations of data. It also includes computer data bases, and computer programs to
the extent that they incorporate authorship in the programmer's expression of original ideas, as distinguished
from the ideas themselves.
Correspondingly, the definition of "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works" carries with it no implied
criterion of artistic taste, aesthetic value, or intrinsic quality. The term is intended to comprise not only "works
of art" in the traditional sense but also works of graphic art and illustration, art reproductions, plans and
[Release Point 118-106]
drawings, photographs and reproductions of them, maps, charts, globes, and other cartographic works, works
of these kinds intended for use in advertising and commerce, and works of "applied art." There is no intention
whatever to narrow the scope of the subject matter now characterized in section 5(k) [section 5(k) of former
title 17] as "prints or labels used for articles of merchandise." However, since this terminology suggests the
material object in which a work is embodied rather than the work itself, the bill does not mention this category
separately.
In accordance with the Supreme Court's decision in Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201 (1954) [74 S.Ct. 460, 98
L. Ed. 630, rehearing denied 74 S.Ct. 637, 347 U.S. 949, 98 L.Ed. 1096], works of "applied art" encompass all
original pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works that are intended to be or have been embodied in useful
articles, regardless of factors such as mass production, commercial exploitation, and the potential availability
of design patent protection. The scope of exclusive rights in these works is given special treatment in section
113, to be discussed below.
The Committee has added language to the definition of "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works" in an
effort to make clearer the distinction between works of applied art protectable under the bill and industrial
designs not subject to copyright protection. The declaration that "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works"
include "works of artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are
concerned" is classic language; it is drawn from Copyright Office regulations promulgated in the 1940's and
expressly endorsed by the Supreme Court in the Mazer case.
The second part of the amendment states that "the design of a useful article * * * shall be considered a
pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial,
graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently
of, the utilitarian aspects of the article." A "useful article" is defined as "an article having an intrinsic
utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information." This
part of the amendment is an adaptation of language added to the Copyright Office Regulations in the
mid-1950's in an effort to implement the Supreme Court's decision in the Mazer case.
In adopting this amendatory language, the Committee is seeking to draw as clear a line as possible between
copyrightable works of applied art and uncopyrighted works of industrial design. A two-dimensional painting,
drawing, or graphic work is still capable of being identified as such when it is printed on or applied to
utilitarian articles such as textile fabrics, wallpaper, containers, and the like. The same is true when a statue or
carving is used to embellish an industrial product or, as in the Mazer case, is incorporated into a product
without losing its ability to exist independently as a work of art. On the other hand, although the shape of an
industrial product may be aesthetically satisfying and valuable, the Committee's intention is not to offer it
copyright protection under the bill. Unless the shape of an automobile, airplane, ladies' dress, food processor,
television set, or any other industrial product contains some element that, physically or conceptually, can be
identified as separable from the utilitarian aspects of that article, the design would not be copyrighted under
the bill. The test of separability and independence from "the utilitarian aspects of the article" does not depend
upon the nature of the design—that is, even if the appearance of an article is determined by aesthetic (as
opposed to functional) considerations, only elements, if any, which can be identified separately from the
useful article as such are copyrightable. And, even if the three-dimensional design contains some such element
(for example, a carving on the back of a chair or a floral relief design on silver flatware), copyright protection
would extend only to that element, and would not cover the over-all configuration of the utilitarian article as
such.
A special situation is presented by architectural works. An architect's plans and drawings would, of course,
be protected by copyright, but the extent to which that protection would extend to the structure depicted would
depend on the circumstances. Purely nonfunctional or monumental structures would be subject to full
copyright protection under the bill, and the same would be true of artistic sculpture or decorative
ornamentation or embellishment added to a structure. On the other hand, where the only elements of shape in
an architectural design are conceptually inseparable from the utilitarian aspects of the structure, copyright
protection for the design would not be available.
The Committee has considered, but chosen to defer, the possibility of protecting the design of typefaces. A
"typeface" can be defined as a set of letters, numbers, or other symbolic characters, whose forms are related by
repeating design elements consistently applied in a notational system and are intended to be embodied in
articles whose intrinsic utilitarian function is for use in composing text or other cognizable combinations of
characters. The Committee does not regard the design of typeface, as thus defined, to be a copyrightable
"pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work" within the meaning of this bill and the application of the dividing line
in section 101.
Enactment of Public Law 92–140 in 1971 [Pub. L. 92–140, Oct. 15, 1971, 85 Stat. 391, which amended
sections 1, 5, 19, 20, 26, and 101 of former title 17, and enacted provisions set out as a note under section 1 of
[Release Point 118-106]
former title 17] marked the first recognition in American copyright law of sound recordings as copyrightable
works. As defined in section 101, copyrightable "sound recordings" are original works of authorship
comprising an aggregate of musical, spoken, or other sounds that have been fixed in tangible form. The
copyrightable work comprises the aggregation of sounds and not the tangible medium of fixation. Thus,
"sound recordings" as copyrightable subject matter are distinguished from "phonorecords," the latter being
physical objects in which sounds are fixed. They are also distinguished from any copyrighted literary,
dramatic, or musical works that may be reproduced on a "phonorecord."
As a class of subject matter, sound recordings are clearly within the scope of the "writings of an author"
capable of protection under the Constitution [Const. Art. I, §8, cl. 8], and the extension of limited statutory
protection to them was too long delayed. Aside from cases in which sounds are fixed by some purely
mechanical means without originality of any kind, the copyright protection that would prevent the
reproduction and distribution of unauthorized phonorecords of sound recordings is clearly justified.
The copyrightable elements in a sound recording will usually, though not always, involve "authorship" both
on the part of the performers whose performance is captured and on the part of the record producer
responsible for setting up the recording session, capturing and electronically processing the sounds, and
compiling and editing them to make the final sound recording. There may, however, be cases where the record
producer's contribution is so minimal that the performance is the only copyrightable element in the work, and
there may be cases (for example, recordings of birdcalls, sounds of racing cars, et cetera) where only the
record producer's contribution is copyrightable.
Sound tracks of motion pictures, long a nebulous area in American copyright law, are specifically included
in the definition of "motion pictures," and excluded in the definition of "sound recordings." To be a "motion
picture," as defined, requires three elements: (1) a series of images, (2) the capability of showing the images in
certain successive order, and (3) an impression of motion when the images are thus shown. Coupled with the
basic requirements of original authorship and fixation in tangible form, this definition encompasses a wide
range of cinematographic works embodied in films, tapes, video disks, and other media. However, it would
not include: (1) unauthorized fixations of live performances or telecasts, (2) live telecasts that are not fixed
simultaneously with their transmission, or (3) filmstrips and slide sets which, although consisting of a series of
images intended to be shown in succession, are not capable of conveying an impression of motion.
On the other hand, the bill equates audiovisual materials such as filmstrips, slide sets, and sets of
transparencies with "motion pictures" rather than with "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works." Their
sequential showing is closer to a "performance" than to a "display," and the definition of "audiovisual works,"
which applies also to "motion pictures," embraces works consisting of a series of related images that are by
their nature, intended for showing by means of projectors or other devices.
Nature of Copyright. Copyright does not preclude others from using the ideas or information revealed by
the author's work. It pertains to the literary, musical, graphic, or artistic form in which the author expressed
intellectual concepts. Section 102(b) makes clear that copyright protection does not extend to any idea,
procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in
which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.
Some concern has been expressed lest copyright in computer programs should extend protection to the
methodology or processes adopted by the programmer, rather than merely to the "writing" expressing his
ideas. Section 102(b) is intended, among other things, to make clear that the expression adopted by the
programmer is the copyrightable element in a computer program, and that the actual processes or methods
embodied in the program are not within the scope of the copyright law.
Section 102(b) in no way enlarges or contracts the scope of copyright protection under the present law. Its
purpose is to restate, in the context of the new single Federal system of copyright, that the basic dichotomy
between expression and idea remains unchanged.

independent of, and does not affect or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any
copyright protection in the preexisting material.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Section 103 complements section 102: A compilation or derivative work is copyrightable if it represents an
"original work of authorship" and falls within one or more of the categories listed in section 102. Read
together, the two sections make plain that the criteria of copyrightable subject matter stated in section 102
apply with full force to works that are entirely original and to those containing preexisting material. Section
103(b) is also intended to define, more sharply and clearly than does section 7 of the present law [section 7 of
former title 17], the important interrelationship and correlation between protection of preexisting and of "new"
material in a particular work. The most important point here is one that is commonly misunderstood today:
copyright in a "new version" covers only the material added by the later author, and has no effect one way or
the other on the copyright or public domain status of the preexisting material.
Between them the terms "compilations" and "derivative works" which are defined in section 101
comprehend every copyrightable work that employs preexisting material or data of any kind. There is
necessarily some overlapping between the two, but they basically represent different concepts. A
"compilation" results from a process of selecting, bringing together, organizing, and arranging previously
existing material of all kinds, regardless of whether the individual items in the material have been or ever
could have been subject to copyright. A "derivative work," on the other hand, requires a process of recasting,
transforming, or adapting "one or more preexisting works"; the "preexisting work" must come within the
general subject matter of copyright set forth in section 102, regardless of whether it is or was ever
copyrighted.
The second part of the sentence that makes up section 103(a) deals with the status of a compilation or
derivative work unlawfully employing preexisting copyrighted material. In providing that protection does not
extend to "any part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully," the bill prevents an
infringer from benefiting, through copyright protection, from committing an unlawful act, but preserves
protection for those parts of the work that do not employ the preexisting work. Thus, an unauthorized
translation of a novel could not be copyrighted at all, but the owner of copyright in an anthology of poetry
could sue someone who infringed the whole anthology, even though the infringer proves that publication of
one of the poems was unauthorized. Under this provision, copyright could be obtained as long as the use of
the preexisting work was not "unlawful," even though the consent of the copyright owner had not been
obtained. For instance, the unauthorized reproduction of a work might be "lawful" under the doctrine of fair
use or an applicable foreign law, and if so the work incorporating it could be copyrighted.
§104. Subject matter of copyright: National origin
(a) UNPUBLISHED WORKS.—The works specified by sections 102 and 103, while unpublished,
are subject to protection under this title without regard to the nationality or domicile of the author.
(b) PUBLISHED WORKS.—The works specified by sections 102 and 103, when published, are
subject to protection under this title if—
[Release Point 118-106]
(1) on the date of first publication, one or more of the authors is a national or domiciliary of the
United States, or is a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of a treaty party, or is a stateless
person, wherever that person may be domiciled; or
(2) the work is first published in the United States or in a foreign nation that, on the date of first
publication, is a treaty party; or
(3) the work is a sound recording that was first fixed in a treaty party; or
(4) the work is a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work that is incorporated in a building or other
structure, or an architectural work that is embodied in a building and the building or structure is
located in the United States or a treaty party; or
(5) the work is first published by the United Nations or any of its specialized agencies, or by the
Organization of American States; or
(6) the work comes within the scope of a Presidential proclamation. Whenever the President
finds that a particular foreign nation extends, to works by authors who are nationals or
domiciliaries of the United States or to works that are first published in the United States,
copyright protection on substantially the same basis as that on which the foreign nation extends
protection to works of its own nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in that nation,
the President may by proclamation extend protection under this title to works of which one or
more of the authors is, on the date of first publication, a national, domiciliary, or sovereign
authority of that nation, or which was first published in that nation. The President may revise,
suspend, or revoke any such proclamation or impose any conditions or limitations on protection
under a proclamation.
For purposes of paragraph (2), a work that is published in the United States or a treaty party within
30 days after publication in a foreign nation that is not a treaty party shall be considered to be first
published in the United States or such treaty party, as the case may be.
(c) EFFECT OF BERNE CONVENTION.—No right or interest in a work eligible for protection
under this title may be claimed by virtue of, or in reliance upon, the provisions of the Berne
Convention, or the adherence of the United States thereto. Any rights in a work eligible for
protection under this title that derive from this title, other Federal or State statutes, or the common
law, shall not be expanded or reduced by virtue of, or in reliance upon, the provisions of the Berne
Convention, or the adherence of the United States thereto.
(d) EFFECT OF PHONOGRAMS TREATIES.—Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
(b), no works other than sound recordings shall be eligible for protection under this title solely by
virtue of the adherence of the United States to the Geneva Phonograms Convention or the WIPO
Performances and Phonograms Treaty.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Section 104 of the bill [this section], which sets forth the basic criteria under which works of foreign origin
can be protected under the U.S. copyright law, divides all works coming within the scope of sections 102 and
103 into two categories: unpublished and published. Subsection (a) imposes no qualifications of nationality
and domicile with respect to unpublished works. Subsection (b) would make published works subject to
protection under any one of four conditions:
(1) The author is a national or domiciliary of the United States or of a country with which the United
States has copyright relations under a treaty, or is a stateless person;
(2) The work is first published in the United States or in a country that is a party to the Universal
Copyright Convention;
(3) The work is first published by the United Nations, by any of its specialized agencies, or by the
Organization of American States; or
(4) The work is covered by a Presidential proclamation extending protection to works originating in a
specified country which extends protection to U.S. works "on substantially the same basis" as to its own
works.
[Release Point 118-106]
The third of these conditions represents a treaty obligation of the United States. Under the Second Protocol
of the Universal Copyright Convention, protection under U.S. Copyright law is expressly required for works
published by the United Nations, by U.N. specialized agencies and by the Organization of American States.

with respect to works first produced or published outside the United States of America and subject to
copyright or to renewal of copyright under the laws of the United States of America, by nationals of countries
which accord substantially equal treatment to citizens of the United States of America; and
WHEREAS satisfactory official assurances have been received that, since April 15, 1892, citizens of the
United States have been entitled to obtain copyright in Germany for their works on substantially the same
basis as German citizens without the need of complying with any formalities, provided such works secured
protection in the United States; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to Article 2 of the Law No. 8, Industrial, Literary and Artistic Property Rights of
Foreign Nations and Nationals, promulgated by the Allied High Commission for Germany on October 20,
1949, literary or artistic property rights in Germany owned by United States nationals at the commencement

their legal successors; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to Article 5 of the aforesaid law, any literary or artistic property right in Germany
[Release Point 118-106]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, LYNDON B. JOHNSON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of
the authority vested in me by Section 9 of Title 17 of the United States Code [section 9 of former Title 17], do
declare and proclaim:
(1) That, with respect to works first produced or published outside the United States of America: (a) where
the work was subject to copyright under the laws of the United States of America on or after September 3,
1939, and on or before May 5, 1956, by an author or other owner who was then a German citizen; or (b)
where the work was subject to renewal of copyright under the laws of the United States of America on or after

25 of the aforesaid Title 17 [sections 24 and 25 of former Title 17], who was then a German citizen, there has
existed during several years of the aforementioned period such disruption and suspension of facilities essential
to compliance with conditions and formalities prescribed with respect to such works by the copyright law of
the United States of America as to bring such works within the terms of Section 9(b) of the aforesaid Title 17
[section 9(b) of former Title 17]; and
(2) That, in view of the reciprocal treatment accorded to citizens of the United States by the Federal
Republic of Germany, the time within which persons who are presently German citizens may comply with
such conditions and formalities with respect to such works is hereby extended for one year after the date of
this proclamation.
It shall be understood that the term of copyright in any case is not and cannot be altered or affected by this
proclamation. It shall also be understood that, as provided by Section 9(b) of Title 17, United States Code
[section 9(b) of former Title 17], no liability shall attach under that title for lawful uses made or acts done
prior to the effective date of this proclamation in connection with the above-described works, or with respect
to the continuance for one year subsequent to such date of any business undertaking or enterprise lawfully
undertaken prior to such date involving expenditure or contractual obligation in connection with the
exploitation, production, reproduction, circulation or performance of any such works.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of July in the year of our Lord
nineteen hundred and sixty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred
and ninety-second.

PRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATIONS ISSUED UNDER PREDECESSOR PROVISIONS
Pub. L. 94–553, title I, §104, Oct. 19, 1976, 90 Stat. 2599, provided that: "All proclamations issued by the
President under section 1(e) or 9(b) of title 17 as it existed on December 31, 1977, or under previous copyright
statutes of the United States, shall continue in force until terminated, suspended, or revised by the President."
§104A. Copyright in restored works
(a) AUTOMATIC PROTECTION AND TERM.—
(1) TERM.—
(A) Copyright subsists, in accordance with this section, in restored works, and vests
automatically on the date of restoration.
(B) Any work in which copyright is restored under this section shall subsist for the remainder
of the term of copyright that the work would have otherwise been granted in the United States if
the work never entered the public domain in the United States.
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) EXCEPTION.—Any work in which the copyright was ever owned or administered by the
Alien Property Custodian and in which the restored copyright would be owned by a government or
instrumentality thereof, is not a restored work.
(b) OWNERSHIP OF RESTORED COPYRIGHT.—A restored work vests initially in the author
or initial rightholder of the work as determined by the law of the source country of the work.
(c) FILING OF NOTICE OF INTENT TO ENFORCE RESTORED COPYRIGHT AGAINST
RELIANCE PARTIES.—On or after the date of restoration, any person who owns a copyright in a
restored work or an exclusive right therein may file with the Copyright Office a notice of intent to
enforce that person's copyright or exclusive right or may serve such a notice directly on a reliance
party. Acceptance of a notice by the Copyright Office is effective as to any reliance parties but shall
not create a presumption of the validity of any of the facts stated therein. Service on a reliance party
is effective as to that reliance party and any other reliance parties with actual knowledge of such
service and of the contents of that notice.
(d) REMEDIES FOR INFRINGEMENT OF RESTORED COPYRIGHTS.—
(1) ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT IN RESTORED WORKS IN THE ABSENCE OF A
RELIANCE PARTY.—As against any party who is not a reliance party, the remedies provided in
chapter 5 of this title shall be available on or after the date of restoration of a restored copyright
with respect to an act of infringement of the restored copyright that is commenced on or after the
date of restoration.
(2) ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT IN RESTORED WORKS AS AGAINST RELIANCE
PARTIES.—As against a reliance party, except to the extent provided in paragraphs (3) and (4),
the remedies provided in chapter 5 of this title shall be available, with respect to an act of
infringement of a restored copyright, on or after the date of restoration of the restored copyright if
the requirements of either of the following subparagraphs are met:
(A)(i) The owner of the restored copyright (or such owner's agent) or the owner of an
exclusive right therein (or such owner's agent) files with the Copyright Office, during the
24-month period beginning on the date of restoration, a notice of intent to enforce the restored
copyright; and
(ii)(I) the act of infringement commenced after the end of the 12-month period beginning on
the date of publication of the notice in the Federal Register;
(II) the act of infringement commenced before the end of the 12-month period described in
subclause (I) and continued after the end of that 12-month period, in which case remedies shall
be available only for infringement occurring after the end of that 12-month period; or
(III) copies or phonorecords of a work in which copyright has been restored under this
section are made after publication of the notice of intent in the Federal Register.
(B)(i) The owner of the restored copyright (or such owner's agent) or the owner of an
exclusive right therein (or such owner's agent) serves upon a reliance party a notice of intent to
enforce a restored copyright; and
(ii)(I) the act of infringement commenced after the end of the 12-month period beginning on
the date the notice of intent is received;
(II) the act of infringement commenced before the end of the 12-month period described in
subclause (I) and continued after the end of that 12-month period, in which case remedies shall
be available only for the infringement occurring after the end of that 12-month period; or
(III) copies or phonorecords of a work in which copyright has been restored under this
section are made after receipt of the notice of intent.
In the event that notice is provided under both subparagraphs (A) and (B), the 12-month period
referred to in such subparagraphs shall run from the earlier of publication or service of notice.
(3) EXISTING DERIVATIVE WORKS.—(A) In the case of a derivative work that is based
upon a restored work and is created—
(i) before the date of the enactment of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, if the source
country of the restored work is an eligible country on such date, or
[Release Point 118-106]
(ii) before the date on which the source country of the restored work becomes an eligible
country, if that country is not an eligible country on such date of enactment,
a reliance party may continue to exploit that derivative work for the duration of the restored
copyright if the reliance party pays to the owner of the restored copyright reasonable
compensation for conduct which would be subject to a remedy for infringement but for the
provisions of this paragraph.
(B) In the absence of an agreement between the parties, the amount of such compensation shall
be determined by an action in United States district court, and shall reflect any harm to the actual
or potential market for or value of the restored work from the reliance party's continued
exploitation of the work, as well as compensation for the relative contributions of expression of
the author of the restored work and the reliance party to the derivative work.
(4) COMMENCEMENT OF INFRINGEMENT FOR RELIANCE PARTIES.—For purposes of
section 412, in the case of reliance parties, infringement shall be deemed to have commenced
before registration when acts which would have constituted infringement had the restored work
been subject to copyright were commenced before the date of restoration.
(e) NOTICES OF INTENT TO ENFORCE A RESTORED COPYRIGHT.—
(1) NOTICES OF INTENT FILED WITH THE COPYRIGHT OFFICE.—(A)(i) A notice of
intent filed with the Copyright Office to enforce a restored copyright shall be signed by the owner
of the restored copyright or the owner of an exclusive right therein, who files the notice under
subsection (d)(2)(A)(i) (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the "owner"), or by the owner's
agent, shall identify the title of the restored work, and shall include an English translation of the
title and any other alternative titles known to the owner by which the restored work may be
identified, and an address and telephone number at which the owner may be contacted. If the
notice is signed by an agent, the agency relationship must have been constituted in a writing
signed by the owner before the filing of the notice. The Copyright Office may specifically require
in regulations other information to be included in the notice, but failure to provide such other
information shall not invalidate the notice or be a basis for refusal to list the restored work in the
Federal Register.
(ii) If a work in which copyright is restored has no formal title, it shall be described in the notice
of intent in detail sufficient to identify it.
(iii) Minor errors or omissions may be corrected by further notice at any time after the notice of
intent is filed. Notices of corrections for such minor errors or omissions shall be accepted after the
period established in subsection (d)(2)(A)(i). Notices shall be published in the Federal Register
pursuant to subparagraph (B).
(B)(i) The Register of Copyrights shall publish in the Federal Register, commencing not later
than 4 months after the date of restoration for a particular nation and every 4 months thereafter for
a period of 2 years, lists identifying restored works and the ownership thereof if a notice of intent
to enforce a restored copyright has been filed.
(ii) Not less than 1 list containing all notices of intent to enforce shall be maintained in the
Public Information Office of the Copyright Office and shall be available for public inspection and
copying during regular business hours pursuant to sections 705 and 708.
(C) The Register of Copyrights is authorized to fix reasonable fees based on the costs of receipt,
processing, recording, and publication of notices of intent to enforce a restored copyright and
corrections thereto.
(D)(i) Not later than 90 days before the date the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property referred to in section 101(d)(15) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act
enters into force with respect to the United States, the Copyright Office shall issue and publish in
the Federal Register regulations governing the filing under this subsection of notices of intent to
enforce a restored copyright.
(ii) Such regulations shall permit owners of restored copyrights to file simultaneously for
registration of the restored copyright.
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) NOTICES OF INTENT SERVED ON A RELIANCE PARTY.—(A) Notices of intent to
enforce a restored copyright may be served on a reliance party at any time after the date of
restoration of the restored copyright.
(B) Notices of intent to enforce a restored copyright served on a reliance party shall be signed
by the owner or the owner's agent, shall identify the restored work and the work in which the
restored work is used, if any, in detail sufficient to identify them, and shall include an English
translation of the title, any other alternative titles known to the owner by which the work may be
identified, the use or uses to which the owner objects, and an address and telephone number at
which the reliance party may contact the owner. If the notice is signed by an agent, the agency
relationship must have been constituted in writing and signed by the owner before service of the
notice.
(3) EFFECT OF MATERIAL FALSE STATEMENTS.—Any material false statement
knowingly made with respect to any restored copyright identified in any notice of intent shall
make void all claims and assertions made with respect to such restored copyright.
(f) IMMUNITY FROM WARRANTY AND RELATED LIABILITY.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Any person who warrants, promises, or guarantees that a work does not
violate an exclusive right granted in section 106 shall not be liable for legal, equitable, arbitral, or
administrative relief if the warranty, promise, or guarantee is breached by virtue of the restoration
of copyright under this section, if such warranty, promise, or guarantee is made before January 1,
1995.
(2) PERFORMANCES.—No person shall be required to perform any act if such performance is
made infringing by virtue of the restoration of copyright under the provisions of this section, if the
obligation to perform was undertaken before January 1, 1995.
(g) PROCLAMATION OF COPYRIGHT RESTORATION.—Whenever the President finds that a
particular foreign nation extends, to works by authors who are nationals or domiciliaries of the
United States, restored copyright protection on substantially the same basis as provided under this
section, the President may by proclamation extend restored protection provided under this section to
any work—
(1) of which one or more of the authors is, on the date of first publication, a national,
domiciliary, or sovereign authority of that nation; or
(2) which was first published in that nation.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Scope of the Prohibition. The basic premise of section 105 of the bill is the same as that of section 8 of the
present law [section 8 of former title 17]—that works produced for the U.S. Government by its officers and
employees should not be subject to copyright. The provision applies the principle equally to unpublished and
published works.
The general prohibition against copyright in section 105 applies to "any work of the United States
Government," which is defined in section 101 as "a work prepared by an officer or employee of the United
States Government as part of that person's official duties." Under this definition a Government official or
employee would not be prevented from securing copyright in a work written at that person's own volition and
outside his or her duties, even though the subject matter involves the Government work or professional field
of the official or employee. Although the wording of the definition of "work of the United States Government"
differs somewhat from that of the definition of "work made for hire," the concepts are intended to be
construed in the same way.
A more difficult and far-reaching problem is whether the definition should be broadened to prohibit
copyright in works prepared under U.S. Government contract or grant. As the bill is written, the Government
agency concerned could determine in each case whether to allow an independent contractor or grantee, to
secure copyright in works prepared in whole or in part with the use of Government funds. The argument that
has been made against allowing copyright in this situation is that the public should not be required to pay a
"double subsidy," and that it is inconsistent to prohibit copyright in works by Government employees while
permitting private copyrights in a growing body of works created by persons who are paid with Government
funds. Those arguing in favor of potential copyright protection have stressed the importance of copyright as an
incentive to creation and dissemination in this situation, and the basically different policy considerations,
[Release Point 118-106]
applicable to works written by Government employees and those applicable to works prepared by private
organizations with the use of Federal funds.
The bill deliberately avoids making any sort of outright, unqualified prohibition against copyright in works
prepared under Government contract or grant. There may well be cases where it would be in the public
interest to deny copyright in the writings generated by Government research contracts and the like; it can be
assumed that, where a Government agency commissions a work for its own use merely as an alternative to
having one of its own employees prepare the work, the right to secure a private copyright would be withheld.
However, there are almost certainly many other cases where the denial of copyright protection would be
unfair or would hamper the production and publication of important works. Where, under the particular
circumstances, Congress or the agency involved finds that the need to have a work freely available outweighs
the need of the private author to secure copyright, the problem can be dealt with by specific legislation,
agency regulations, or contractual restrictions.
The prohibition on copyright protection for United States Government works is not intended to have any
effect on protection of these works abroad. Works of the governments of most other countries are copyrighted.
There are no valid policy reasons for denying such protection to United States Government works in foreign
countries, or for precluding the Government from making licenses for the use of its works abroad.
The effect of section 105 is intended to place all works of the United States Government, published or
unpublished, in the public domain. This means that the individual Government official or employee who
wrote the work could not secure copyright in it or restrain its dissemination by the Government or anyone
else, but it also means that, as far as the copyright law is concerned, the Government could not restrain the
employee or official from disseminating the work if he or she chooses to do so. The use of the term "work of
the United States Government" does not mean that a work falling within the definition of that term is the
property of the U.S. Government.
LIMITED EXCEPTION FOR NATIONAL TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE
At the House hearings in 1975 the U.S. Department of Commerce called attention to its National Technical
Information Service (NTIS), which has a statutory mandate, under Chapter 23 [§1151 et seq.] of Title 15 of
the U.S. Code, to operate a clearinghouse for the collection and dissemination of scientific, technical and
engineering information. Under its statute, NTIS is required to be as self-sustaining as possible, and not to
force the general public to bear publishing costs that are for private benefit. The Department urged an
amendment to section 105 that would allow it to secure copyright in NTIS publications both in the United
States and abroad, noting that a precedent exists in the Standard Reference Data Act (15 U.S.C. §290(e)
[§290e]).
In response to this request the Committee adopted a limited exception to the general prohibition in section
105, permitting the Secretary of Commerce to "secure copyright for a limited term not to exceed five years, on
behalf of the United States as author or copyright owner" in any NTIS publication disseminated pursuant to 15
U.S.C. Chapter 23 [§1151 et seq.]. In order to "secure copyright" in a work under this amendment the
Secretary would be required to publish the work with a copyright notice, and the five-year term would begin
upon the date of first publication.
Proposed Saving Clause. Section 8 of the statute now in effect [section 8 of former title 17] includes a
saving clause intended to make clear that the copyright protection of a private work is not affected if the work
is published by the Government. This provision serves a real purpose in the present law because of the
ambiguity of the undefined term "any publication of the United States Government." Section 105 of the bill,
however, uses the operative term "work of the United States Government" and defines it in such a way that
privately written works are clearly excluded from the prohibition; accordingly, a saving clause becomes
superfluous.
Retention of a saving clause has been urged on the ground that the present statutory provision is frequently
cited, and that having the provision expressly stated in the law would avoid questions and explanations. The
committee here observes: (1) there is nothing in section 105 that would relieve the Government of its
obligation to secure permission in order to publish a copyrighted work; and (2) publication or other use by the
Government of a private work would not affect its copyright protection in any way. The question of use of
copyrighted material in documents published by the Congress and its Committees is discussed below in
connection with section 107.
Works of the United States Postal Service. The intent of section 105 [this section] is to restrict the
prohibition against Government copyright to works written by employees of the United States Government
within the scope of their official duties. In accordance with the objectives of the Postal Reorganization Act of
1970 [Pub. L. 91–375, which enacted title 39, Postal Service], this section does not apply to works created by
employees of the United States Postal Service. In addition to enforcing the criminal statutes proscribing the
[Release Point 118-106]
forgery or counterfeiting of postage stamps, the Postal Service could, if it chooses, use the copyright law to
prevent the reproduction of postage stamp designs for private or commercial non-postal services (for example,
in philatelic publications and catalogs, in general advertising, in art reproductions, in textile designs, and so
forth). However, any copyright claimed by the Postal Service in its works, including postage stamp designs,
would be subject to the same conditions, formalities, and time limits as other copyrightable works.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
[Release Point 118-106]
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
General Scope of Copyright. The five fundamental rights that the bill gives to copyright owners—the
exclusive rights of reproduction, adaptation, publication, performance, and display—are stated generally in
section 106. These exclusive rights, which comprise the so-called "bundle of rights" that is a copyright, are
cumulative and may overlap in some cases. Each of the five enumerated rights may be subdivided indefinitely
and, as discussed below in connection with section 201, each subdivision of an exclusive right may be owned
and enforced separately.
The approach of the bill is to set forth the copyright owner's exclusive rights in broad terms in section 106,
and then to provide various limitations, qualifications, or exemptions in the 12 sections that follow. Thus,
everything in section 106 is made "subject to sections 107 through 118", and must be read in conjunction with
those provisions.
The exclusive rights accorded to a copyright owner under section 106 are "to do and to authorize" any of
the activities specified in the five numbered clauses. Use of the phrase "to authorize" is intended to avoid any
questions as to the liability of contributory infringers. For example, a person who lawfully acquires an
authorized copy of a motion picture would be an infringer if he or she engages in the business of renting it to
others for purposes of unauthorized public performance.
Rights of Reproduction, Adaptation, and Publication. The first three clauses of section 106, which cover
all rights under a copyright except those of performance and display, extend to every kind of copyrighted
work. The exclusive rights encompassed by these clauses, though closely related, are independent; they can
generally be characterized as rights of copying, recording, adaptation, and publishing. A single act of
infringement may violate all of these rights at once, as where a publisher reproduces, adapts, and sells copies
of a person's copyrighted work as part of a publishing venture. Infringement takes place when any one of the
rights is violated: where, for example, a printer reproduces copies without selling them or a retailer sells
copies without having anything to do with their reproduction. The references to "copies or phonorecords,"
although in the plural, are intended here and throughout the bill to include the singular (1 U.S.C. §1).
Reproduction.—Read together with the relevant definitions in section 101, the right "to reproduce the
copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords" means the right to produce a material object in which the work
is duplicated, transcribed, imitated, or simulated in a fixed form from which it can be "perceived, reproduced,
or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device." As under the present law,
a copyrighted work would be infringed by reproducing it in whole or in any substantial part, and by
duplicating it exactly or by imitation or simulation. Wide departures or variations from the copyrighted work
would still be an infringement as long as the author's "expression" rather than merely the author's "ideas" are
taken. An exception to this general principle, applicable to the reproduction of copyrighted sound recordings,
is specified in section 114.
"Reproduction" under clause (1) of section 106 is to be distinguished from "display" under clause (5). For a
work to be "reproduced," its fixation in tangible form must be "sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to
be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration." Thus, the
showing of images on a screen or tube would not be a violation of clause (1), although it might come within
the scope of clause (5).
Preparation of Derivative Works.—The exclusive right to prepare derivative works, specified separately in
clause (2) of section 106, overlaps the exclusive right of reproduction to some extent. It is broader than that
right, however, in the sense that reproduction requires fixation in copies or phonorecords, whereas the
preparation of a derivative work, such as a ballet, pantomime, or improvised performance, may be an
infringement even though nothing is ever fixed in tangible form.
To be an infringement the "derivative work" must be "based upon the copyrighted work," and the definition
in section 101 refers to "a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may
be recast, transformed, or adapted." Thus, to constitute a violation of section 106(2), the infringing work must
incorporate a portion of the copyrighted work in some form; for example, a detailed commentary on a work or
a programmatic musical composition inspired by a novel would not normally constitute infringements under
this clause.
Use in Information Storage and Retrieval Systems.—As section 117 declares explicitly, the bill is not
intended to alter the present law with respect to the use of copyrighted works in computer systems.
Public Distribution.—Clause (3) of section 106 establishes the exclusive right of publication: The right "to
distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership,
or by rental, lease, or lending." Under this provision the copyright owner would have the right to control the
first public distribution of an authorized copy or phonorecord of his work, whether by sale, gift, loan, or some
rental or lease arrangement. Likewise, any unauthorized public distribution of copies or phonorecords that
[Release Point 118-106]
were unlawfully made would be an infringement. As section 109 makes clear, however, the copyright owner's
rights under section 106(3) cease with respect to a particular copy or phonorecord once he has parted with
ownership of it.
Rights of Public Performance and Display. Performing Rights and the "For Profit" Limitation.—The
right of public performance under section 106(4) extends to "literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic
works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works and sound recordings" and, unlike the
equivalent provisions now in effect, is not limited by any "for profit" requirement. The approach of the bill, as
in many foreign laws, is first to state the public performance right in broad terms, and then to provide specific
exemptions for educational and other nonprofit uses.
This approach is more reasonable than the outright exemption of the 1909 statute. The line between
commercial and "nonprofit" organizations is increasingly difficult to draw. Many "non-profit" organizations
are highly subsidized and capable of paying royalties, and the widespread public exploitation of copyrighted
works by public broadcasters and other noncommercial organizations is likely to grow. In addition to these
trends, it is worth noting that performances and displays are continuing to supplant markets for printed copies
and that in the future a broad "not for profit" exemption could not only hurt authors but could dry up their
incentive to write.
The exclusive right of public performance is expanded to include not only motion pictures, including works
recorded on film, video tape, and video disks, but also audiovisual works such as filmstrips and sets of slides.
This provision of section 106(4), which is consistent with the assimilation of motion pictures to audiovisual
works throughout the bill, is also related to amendments of the definitions of "display" and "perform"
discussed below. The important issue of performing rights in sound recordings is discussed in connection with
section 114.
Right of Public Display.—Clause (5) of section 106 represents the first explicit statutory recognition in
American copyright law of an exclusive right to show a copyrighted work, or an image of it, to the public. The
existence or extent of this right under the present statute is uncertain and subject to challenge. The bill would
give the owners of copyright in "literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and
pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works", including the individual images of a motion picture or other
audiovisual work, the exclusive right "to display the copyrighted work publicly."
Definitions. Under the definitions of "perform," "display," "publicly," and "transmit" in section 101, the
concepts of public performance and public display cover not only the initial rendition or showing, but also any
further act by which that rendition or showing is transmitted or communicated to the public. Thus, for
example: a singer is performing when he or she sings a song; a broadcasting network is performing when it
transmits his or her performance (whether simultaneously or from records); a local broadcaster is performing
when it transmits the network broadcast; a cable television system is performing when it retransmits the
broadcast to its subscribers; and any individual is performing whenever he or she plays a phonorecord
embodying the performance or communicates the performance by turning on a receiving set. Although any act
by which the initial performance or display is transmitted, repeated, or made to recur would itself be a
"performance" or "display" under the bill, it would not be actionable as an infringement unless it were done
"publicly," as defined in section 101. Certain other performances and displays, in addition to those that are
"private," are exempted or given qualified copyright control under sections 107 through 118.
To "perform" a work, under the definition in section 101, includes reading a literary work aloud, singing or
playing music, dancing a ballet or other choreographic work, and acting out a dramatic work or pantomime. A
performance may be accomplished "either directly or by means of any device or process," including all kinds
of equipment for reproducing or amplifying sounds or visual images, any sort of transmitting apparatus, any
type of electronic retrieval system, and any other techniques and systems not yet in use or even invented.
The definition of "perform" in relation to "a motion picture or other audiovisual work" is "to show its
images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible." The showing of portions of a motion
picture, filmstrip, or slide set must therefore be sequential to constitute a "performance" rather than a
"display", but no particular order need be maintained. The purely aural performance of a motion picture sound
track, or of the sound portions of an audiovisual work, would constitute a performance of the "motion picture
or other audiovisual work"; but, where some of the sounds have been reproduced separately on phonorecords,
a performance from the phonorecord would not constitute performance of the motion picture or audiovisual
work.
The corresponding definition of "display" covers any showing of a "copy" of the work, "either directly or
by means of a film, slide, television image, or any other device or process." Since "copies" are defined as
including the material object "in which the work is first fixed," the right of public display applies to original
works of art as well as to reproductions of them. With respect to motion pictures and other audiovisual works,
it is a "display" (rather than a "performance") to show their "individual images nonsequentially." In addition to
[Release Point 118-106]
the direct showings of a copy of a work, "display" would include the projection of an image on a screen or
other surface by any method, the transmission of an image by electronic or other means, and the showing of
an image on a cathode ray tube, or similar viewing apparatus connected with any sort of information storage
and retrieval system.
Under clause (1) of the definition of "publicly" in section 101, a performance or display is "public" if it
takes place "at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a
normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered." One of the principal purposes of the
definition was to make clear that, contrary to the decision in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Distributing Corp. v.
Wyatt, 21 C.O.Bull. 203 (D.Md.1932), performances in "semipublic" places such as clubs, lodges, factories,
summer camps, and schools are "public performances" subject to copyright control. The term "a family" in
this context would include an individual living alone, so that a gathering confined to the individual's social
acquaintances would normally be regarded as private. Routine meetings of businesses and governmental
personnel would be excluded because they do not represent the gathering of a "substantial number of persons."
Clause (2) of the definition of "publicly" in section 101 makes clear that the concepts of public performance
and public display include not only performances and displays that occur initially in a public place, but also
acts that transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to the public by means of
any device or process. The definition of "transmit"—to communicate a performance or display "by any device
or process whereby images or sound are received beyond the place from which they are sent"—is broad
enough to include all conceivable forms and combinations of wired or wireless communications media,
including but by no means limited to radio and television broadcasting as we know them. Each and every
method by which the images or sounds comprising a performance or display are picked up and conveyed is a
"transmission," and if the transmission reaches the public in my [any] form, the case comes within the scope
of clauses (4) or (5) of section 106.
Under the bill, as under the present law, a performance made available by transmission to the public at large
is "public" even though the recipients are not gathered in a single place, and even if there is no proof that any
of the potential recipients was operating his receiving apparatus at the time of the transmission. The same
principles apply whenever the potential recipients of the transmission represent a limited segment of the
public, such as the occupants of hotel rooms or the subscribers of a cable television service. Clause (2) of the
definition of "publicly" is applicable "whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance
or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times."

§106A. Rights of certain authors to attribution and integrity
(a) RIGHTS OF ATTRIBUTION AND INTEGRITY.—Subject to section 107 and independent of
the exclusive rights provided in section 106, the author of a work of visual art—
(1) shall have the right—
(A) to claim authorship of that work, and
(B) to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of any work of visual art which he or
she did not create;
(2) shall have the right to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of the work of visual
art in the event of a distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work which would be
prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation; and
(3) subject to the limitations set forth in section 113(d), shall have the right—
(A) to prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of that work which
would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation, and any intentional distortion, mutilation,
or modification of that work is a violation of that right, and
(B) to prevent any destruction of a work of recognized stature, and any intentional or grossly
negligent destruction of that work is a violation of that right.
[Release Point 118-106]
(b) SCOPE AND EXERCISE OF RIGHTS.—Only the author of a work of visual art has the rights
conferred by subsection (a) in that work, whether or not the author is the copyright owner. The
authors of a joint work of visual art are coowners of the rights conferred by subsection (a) in that
work.
(c) EXCEPTIONS.—(1) The modification of a work of visual art which is a result of the passage
of time or the inherent nature of the materials is not a distortion, mutilation, or other modification
described in subsection (a)(3)(A).
(2) The modification of a work of visual art which is the result of conservation, or of the public
presentation, including lighting and placement, of the work is not a destruction, distortion,
mutilation, or other modification described in subsection (a)(3) unless the modification is caused by
gross negligence.
(3) The rights described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) shall not apply to any
reproduction, depiction, portrayal, or other use of a work in, upon, or in any connection with any
item described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of the definition of "work of visual art" in section 101, and
any such reproduction, depiction, portrayal, or other use of a work is not a destruction, distortion,
mutilation, or other modification described in paragraph (3) of subsection (a).
(d) DURATION OF RIGHTS.—(1) With respect to works of visual art created on or after the
effective date set forth in section 610(a) of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, the rights conferred
by subsection (a) shall endure for a term consisting of the life of the author.
(2) With respect to works of visual art created before the effective date set forth in section 610(a)
of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, but title to which has not, as of such effective date, been
transferred from the author, the rights conferred by subsection (a) shall be coextensive with, and
shall expire at the same time as, the rights conferred by section 106.
(3) In the case of a joint work prepared by two or more authors, the rights conferred by subsection
(a) shall endure for a term consisting of the life of the last surviving author.
(4) All terms of the rights conferred by subsection (a) run to the end of the calendar year in which
they would otherwise expire.
(e) TRANSFER AND WAIVER.—(1) The rights conferred by subsection (a) may not be
transferred, but those rights may be waived if the author expressly agrees to such waiver in a written
instrument signed by the author. Such instrument shall specifically identify the work, and uses of that
work, to which the waiver applies, and the waiver shall apply only to the work and uses so identified.
In the case of a joint work prepared by two or more authors, a waiver of rights under this paragraph
made by one such author waives such rights for all such authors.
(2) Ownership of the rights conferred by subsection (a) with respect to a work of visual art is
distinct from ownership of any copy of that work, or of a copyright or any exclusive right under a
copyright in that work. Transfer of ownership of any copy of a work of visual art, or of a copyright
or any exclusive right under a copyright, shall not constitute a waiver of the rights conferred by
subsection (a). Except as may otherwise be agreed by the author in a written instrument signed by
the author, a waiver of the rights conferred by subsection (a) with respect to a work of visual art shall
not constitute a transfer of ownership of any copy of that work, or of ownership of a copyright or of
any exclusive right under a copyright in that work.

§107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use
Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work,
including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by
that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple
copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In
determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be
considered shall include—
(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature
or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a
whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made
upon consideration of all the above factors.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
General Background of the Problem. The judicial doctrine of fair use, one of the most important and
well-established limitations on the exclusive right of copyright owners, would be given express statutory
recognition for the first time in section 107. The claim that a defendant's acts constituted a fair use rather than
an infringement has been raised as a defense in innumerable copyright actions over the years, and there is
ample case law recognizing the existence of the doctrine and applying it. The examples enumerated at page 24
of the Register's 1961 Report, while by no means exhaustive, give some idea of the sort of activities the courts
might regard as fair use under the circumstances: "quotation of excerpts in a review or criticism for purposes
of illustration or comment; quotation of short passages in a scholarly or technical work, for illustration or
clarification of the author's observations; use in a parody of some of the content of the work parodied;
summary of an address or article, with brief quotations, in a news report; reproduction by a library of a portion
[Release Point 118-106]
of a work to replace part of a damaged copy; reproduction by a teacher or student of a small part of a work to
illustrate a lesson; reproduction of a work in legislative or judicial proceedings or reports; incidental and
fortuitous reproduction, in a newsreel or broadcast, of a work located in the scene of an event being reported."
Although the courts have considered and ruled upon the fair use doctrine over and over again, no real
definition of the concept has ever emerged. Indeed, since the doctrine is an equitable rule of reason, no
generally applicable definition is possible, and each case raising the question must be decided on its own facts.
On the other hand, the courts have evolved a set of criteria which, though in no case definitive or
determinative, provide some gauge for balancing the equities. These criteria have been stated in various ways,
but essentially they can all be reduced to the four standards which have been adopted in section 107: "(1) the
purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion
used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for
or value of the copyrighted work."
These criteria are relevant in determining whether the basic doctrine of fair use, as stated in the first
sentence of section 107, applies in a particular case: "Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, the fair
use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other
means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including
multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright."
The specific wording of section 107 as it now stands is the result of a process of accretion, resulting from
the long controversy over the related problems of fair use and the reproduction (mostly by photocopying) of
copyrighted material for educational and scholarly purposes. For example, the reference to fair use "by
reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means" is mainly intended to make clear that the
doctrine has as much application to photocopying and taping as to older forms of use; it is not intended to give
these kinds of reproduction any special status under the fair use provision or to sanction any reproduction
beyond the normal and reasonable limits of fair use. Similarly, the newly-added reference to "multiple copies
for classroom use" is a recognition that, under the proper circumstances of fairness, the doctrine can be
applied to reproductions of multiple copies for the members of a class.
The Committee has amended the first of the criteria to be considered—"the purpose and character of the
use"—to state explicitly that this factor includes a consideration of "whether such use is of a commercial
nature or is for non-profit educational purposes." This amendment is not intended to be interpreted as any sort
of not-for-profit limitation on educational uses of copyrighted works. It is an express recognition that, as under
the present law, the commercial or non-profit character of an activity, while not conclusive with respect to fair
use, can and should be weighed along with other factors in fair use decisions.
General Intention Behind the Provision. The statement of the fair use doctrine in section 107 offers some
guidance to users in determining when the principles of the doctrine apply. However, the endless variety of
situations and combinations of circumstances that can rise in particular cases precludes the formulation of
exact rules in the statute. The bill endorses the purpose and general scope of the judicial doctrine of fair use,
but there is no disposition to freeze the doctrine in the statute, especially during a period of rapid technological
change. Beyond a very broad statutory explanation of what fair use is and some of the criteria applicable to it,
the courts must be free to adapt the doctrine to particular situations on a case-by-case basis. Section 107 is
intended to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way.
Intention as to Classroom Reproduction. Although the works and uses to which the doctrine of fair use is
applicable are as broad as the copyright law itself, most of the discussion of section 107 has centered around
questions of classroom reproduction, particularly photocopying. The arguments on the question are
summarized at pp. 30–31 of this Committee's 1967 report (H.R. Rep. No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st Sess.), and have
not changed materially in the intervening years.
The Committee also adheres to its earlier conclusion, that "a specific exemption freeing certain
reproductions of copyrighted works for educational and scholarly purposes from copyright control is not
justified." At the same time the Committee recognizes, as it did in 1967, that there is a "need for greater
certainty and protection for teachers." In an effort to meet this need the Committee has not only adopted
further amendments to section 107, but has also amended section 504(c) to provide innocent teachers and
other non-profit users of copyrighted material with broad insulation against unwarranted liability for
infringement. The latter amendments are discussed below in connection with Chapter 5 of the bill [§501 et
seq. of this title].
In 1967 the Committee also sought to approach this problem by including, in its report, a very thorough
discussion of "the considerations lying behind the four criteria listed in the amended section 107, in the
context of typical classroom situations arising today." This discussion appeared on pp. 32–35 of the 1967
report, and with some changes has been retained in the Senate report on S. 22 (S. Rep. No. 94–473, pp.
[Release Point 118-106]
63–65). The Committee has reviewed this discussion, and considers that it still has value as an analysis of
various aspects of the problem.
At the Judiciary Subcommittee hearings in June 1975, Chairman Kastenmeier and other members urged the
parties to meet together independently in an effort to achieve a meeting of the minds as to permissible
educational uses of copyrighted material. The response to these suggestions was positive, and a number of
meetings of three groups, dealing respectively with classroom reproduction of printed material, music, and
audio-visual material, were held beginning in September 1975.
In a joint letter to Chairman Kastenmeier, dated March 19, 1976, the representatives of the Ad Hoc
Committee of Educational Institutions and Organizations on Copyright Law Revision, and of the Authors
League of America, Inc., and the Association of American Publishers, Inc., stated:
You may remember that in our letter of March 8, 1976 we told you that the negotiating teams
representing authors and publishers and the Ad Hoc Group had reached tentative agreement on guidelines
to insert in the Committee Report covering educational copying from books and periodicals under Section
107 of H.R. 2223 and S. 22 [this section], and that as part of that tentative agreement each side would
accept the amendments to Sections 107 and 504 [this section and section 504 of this title] which were
adopted by your Subcommittee on March 3, 1976.
We are now happy to tell you that the agreement has been approved by the principals and we enclose a
copy herewith. We had originally intended to translate the agreement into language suitable for inclusion in
the legislative report dealing with Section 107 [this section], but we have since been advised by committee
staff that this will not be necessary.
As stated above, the agreement refers only to copying from books and periodicals, and it is not
intended to apply to musical or audiovisual works.
The full text of the agreement is as follows:
AGREEMENT ON GUIDELINES FOR CLASSROOM COPYING IN NOT-FOR-PROFIT
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
WITH RESPECT TO BOOKS AND PERIODICALS
The purpose of the following guidelines is to state the minimum and not the maximum standards of
educational fair use under Section 107 of H.R. 2223 [this section]. The parties agree that the conditions
determining the extent of permissible copying for educational purposes may change in the future; that
certain types of copying permitted under these guidelines may not be permissible in the future; and
conversely that in the future other types of copying not permitted under these guidelines may be permissible
under revised guidelines.
Moreover, the following statement of guidelines is not intended to limit the types of copying permitted
under the standards of fair use under judicial decision and which are stated in Section 107 of the Copyright
Revision Bill [this section]. There may be instances in which copying which does not fall within the
guidelines stated below may nonetheless be permitted under the criteria of fair use.
GUIDELINES
I. Single Copying for Teachers
A single copy may be made of any of the following by or for a teacher at his or her individual request
for his or her scholarly research or use in teaching or preparation to teach a class:
A. A chapter from a book;
B. An article from a periodical or newspaper;
C. A short story, short essay or short poem, whether or not from a collective work;
D. A chart, graph, diagram, drawing, cartoon or picture from a book, periodical, or newspaper;
II. Multiple Copies for Classroom Use
Multiple copies (not to exceed in any event more than one copy per pupil in a course) may be made by
or for the teacher giving the course for classroom use or discussion; provided that:
A. The copying meets the tests of brevity and spontaneity as defined below; and,
B. Meets the cumulative effect test as defined below; and
C. Each copy includes a notice of copyright.
Definitions
Brevity
(i) Poetry: (a) A complete poem if less than 250 words and if printed on not more than two pages or,
(b) from a longer poem, an excerpt of not more than 250 words.
(ii) Prose: (a) Either a complete article, story or essay of less than 2,500 words, or (b) an excerpt from
[Release Point 118-106]
any prose work of not more than 1,000 words or 10% of the work, whichever is less, but in any event a
minimum of 500 words.
[Each of the numerical limits stated in "i" and "ii" above may be expanded to permit the completion of
an unfinished line of a poem or of an unfinished prose paragraph.]
(iii) Illustration: One chart, graph, diagram, drawing, cartoon or picture per book or per periodical
issue.
(iv) "Special" works: Certain works in poetry, prose or in "poetic prose" which often combine
language with illustrations and which are intended sometimes for children and at other times for a more
general audience fall short of 2,500 words in their entirety. Paragraph "ii" above notwithstanding such
"special works" may not be reproduced in their entirety; however, an excerpt comprising not more than two
of the published pages of such special work and containing not more than 10% of the words found in the
text thereof, may be reproduced.
Spontaneity
(i) The copying is at the instance and inspiration of the individual teacher, and

Notwithstanding any of the above, the following shall be prohibited:
(A) Copying shall not be used to create or to replace or substitute for anthologies, compilations or
collective works. Such replacement or substitution may occur whether copies of various works or excerpts
therefrom are accumulated or reproduced and used separately.
(B) There shall be no copying of or from works intended to be "consumable" in the course of study or
of teaching. These include workbooks, exercises, standardized tests and test booklets and answer sheets and

CHAIRMAN, COPYRIGHT COMMITTEE.
In a joint letter dated April 30, 1976, representatives of the Music Publishers' Association of the United
States, Inc., the National Music Publishers' Association, Inc., the Music Teachers National Association, the
Music Educators National Conference, the National Association of Schools of Music, and the Ad Hoc
[Release Point 118-106]
Committee on Copyright Law Revision, wrote to Chairman Kastenmeier as follows:
During the hearings on H.R. 2223 in June 1975, you and several of your subcommittee members
suggested that concerned groups should work together in developing guidelines which would be helpful to
clarify Section 107 of the bill [this section].
Representatives of music educators and music publishers delayed their meetings until guidelines had
been developed relative to books and periodicals. Shortly after that work was completed and those
guidelines were forwarded to your subcommittee, representatives of the undersigned music organizations
met together with representatives of the Ad Hoc Committee on Copyright Law Revision to draft guidelines
relative to music.
We are very pleased to inform you that the discussions thus have been fruitful on the guidelines which
have been developed. Since private music teachers are an important factor in music education, due
consideration has been given to the concerns of that group.
We trust that this will be helpful in the report on the bill to clarify Fair Use as it applies to music.
The text of the guidelines accompanying this letter is as follows:
GUIDELINES FOR EDUCATIONAL USES OF MUSIC
The purpose of the following guidelines is to state the minimum and not the maximum standards of
educational fair use under Section 107 of H.R. 2223 [this section]. The parties agree that the conditions
determining the extent of permissible copying for educational purposes may change in the future; that
certain types of copying permitted under these guidelines may not be permissible in the future, and
conversely that in the future other types of copying not permitted under these guidelines may be permissible
under revised guidelines.
Moreover, the following statement of guidelines is not intended to limit the types of copying permitted
under the standards of fair use under judicial decision and which are stated in Section 107 of the Copyright
Revision Bill [this section]. There may be instances in which copying which does not fall within the
guidelines stated below may nonetheless be permitted under the criteria of fair use.
A. Permissible Uses
1. Emergency copying to replace purchased copies which for any reason are not available for an
imminent performance provided purchased replacement copies shall be substituted in due course.
2. (a) For academic purposes other than performance, multiple copies of excerpts of works may be
made, provided that the excerpts do not comprise a part of the whole which would constitute a performable
unit such as a section, movement or aria, but in no case more than 10% of the whole work. The number of
copies shall not exceed one copy per pupil.
(b) For academic purposes other than performance, a single copy of an entire performable unit
(section, movement, aria, etc.) that is, (1) confirmed by the copyright proprietor to be out of print or (2)
unavailable except in a larger work, may be made by or for a teacher solely for the purpose of his or her
scholarly research or in preparation to teach a class.
3. Printed copies which have been purchased may be edited or simplified provided that the
fundamental character of the work is not distorted or the lyrics, if any, altered or lyrics added if none exist.
4. A single copy of recordings of performances by students may be made for evaluation or rehearsal
purposes and may be retained by the educational institution or individual teacher.
5. A single copy of a sound recording (such as a tape, disc or cassette) of copyrighted music may be
made from sound recordings owned by an educational institution or an individual teacher for the purpose of
constructing aural exercises or examinations and may be retained by the educational institution or
individual teacher. (This pertains only to the copyright of the music itself and not to any copyright which
may exist in the sound recording.)
B. Prohibitions
1. Copying to create or replace or substitute for anthologies, compilations or collective works.
2. Copying of or from works intended to be "consumable" in the course of study or of teaching such as
workbooks, exercises, standardized tests and answer sheets and like material.
3. Copying for the purpose of performance, except as in A(1) above.
4. Copying for the purpose of substituting for the purchase of music, except as in A(1) and A(2) above.
5. Copying without inclusion of the copyright notice which appears on the printed copy.
The problem of off-the-air taping for nonprofit classroom use of copyrighted audiovisual works
incorporated in radio and television broadcasts has proved to be difficult to resolve. The Committee believes
that the fair use doctrine has some limited application in this area, but it appears that the development of
[Release Point 118-106]
detailed guidelines will require a more thorough exploration than has so far been possible of the needs and
problems of a number of different interests affected, and of the various legal problems presented. Nothing in
section 107 or elsewhere in the bill is intended to change or prejudge the law on the point. On the other hand,
the Committee is sensitive to the importance of the problem, and urges the representatives of the various
interests, if possible under the leadership of the Register of Copyrights, to continue their discussions actively
and in a constructive spirit. If it would be helpful to a solution, the Committee is receptive to undertaking
further consideration of the problem in a future Congress.
The Committee appreciates and commends the efforts and the cooperative and reasonable spirit of the
parties who achieved the agreed guidelines on books and periodicals and on music. Representatives of the
American Association of University Professors and of the Association of American Law Schools have written
to the Committee strongly criticizing the guidelines, particularly with respect to multiple copying, as being too
restrictive with respect to classroom situations at the university and graduate level. However, the Committee
notes that the Ad Hoc group did include representatives of higher education, that the stated "purpose of the
* * * guidelines is to state the minimum and not the maximum standards of educational fair use" and that the
agreement acknowledges "there may be instances in which copying which does not fall within the guidelines
* * * may nonetheless be permitted under the criteria of fair use."
The Committee believes the guidelines are a reasonable interpretation of the minimum standards of fair use.
Teachers will know that copying within the guidelines is fair use. Thus, the guidelines serve the purpose of
fulfilling the need for greater certainty and protection for teachers. The Committee expresses the hope that if
there are areas where standards other than these guidelines may be appropriate, the parties will continue their
efforts to provide additional specific guidelines in the same spirit of good will and give and take that has
marked the discussion of this subject in recent months.
Reproduction and Uses for Other Purposes. The concentrated attention given the fair use provision in the
context of classroom teaching activities should not obscure its application in other areas. It must be
emphasized again that the same general standards of fair use are applicable to all kinds of uses of copyrighted
material, although the relative weight to be given them will differ from case to case.
The fair use doctrine would be relevant to the use of excerpts from copyrighted works in educational
broadcasting activities not exempted under section 110(2) or 112, and not covered by the licensing provisions
of section 118. In these cases the factors to be weighed in applying the criteria of this section would include
whether the performers, producers, directors, and others responsible for the broadcast were paid, the size and
nature of the audience, the size and number of excerpts taken and, in the case of recordings made for
broadcast, the number of copies reproduced and the extent of their reuse or exchange. The availability of the
fair use doctrine to educational broadcasters would be narrowly circumscribed in the case of motion pictures
and other audiovisual works, but under appropriate circumstances it could apply to the nonsequential showing
of an individual still or slide, or to the performance of a short excerpt from a motion picture for criticism or
comment.
Another special instance illustrating the application of the fair use doctrine pertains to the making of copies
or phonorecords of works in the special forms needed for the use of blind persons. These special forms, such
as copies in Braille and phonorecords of oral readings (talking books), are not usually made by the publishers
for commercial distribution. For the most part, such copies and phonorecords are made by the Library of
Congress' Division for the Blind and Physically Handicapped with permission obtained from the copyright
owners, and are circulated to blind persons through regional libraries covering the nation. In addition, such
copies and phonorecords are made locally by individual volunteers for the use of blind persons in their
communities, and the Library of Congress conducts a program for training such volunteers. While the making
of multiple copies or phonorecords of a work for general circulation requires the permission of the copyright
owner, a problem addressed in section 710 of the bill, the making of a single copy or phonorecord by an
individual as a free service for blind persons would properly be considered a fair use under section 107.
A problem of particular urgency is that of preserving for posterity prints of motion pictures made before
1942. Aside from the deplorable fact that in a great many cases the only existing copy of a film has been
deliberately destroyed, those that remain are in immediate danger of disintegration; they were printed on film
stock with a nitrate base that will inevitably decompose in time. The efforts of the Library of Congress, the
American Film Institute, and other organizations to rescue and preserve this irreplaceable contribution to our
cultural life are to be applauded, and the making of duplicate copies for purposes of archival preservation
certainly falls within the scope of "fair use."
When a copyrighted work contains unfair, inaccurate, or derogatory information concerning an individual
or institution, the individual or institution may copy and reproduce such parts of the work as are necessary to
permit understandable comment on the statements made in the work.
The Committee has considered the question of publication, in Congressional hearings and documents, of
[Release Point 118-106]
copyrighted material. Where the length of the work or excerpt published and the number of copies authorized
are reasonable under the circumstances, and the work itself is directly relevant to a matter of legitimate
legislative concern, the Committee believes that the publication would constitute fair use.
During the consideration of the revision bill in the 94th Congress it was proposed that independent
newsletters, as distinguished from house organs and publicity or advertising publications, be given separate
treatment. It is argued that newsletters are particularly vulnerable to mass photocopying, and that most
newsletters have fairly modest circulations. Whether the copying of portions of a newsletter is an act of
infringement or a fair use will necessarily turn on the facts of the individual case. However, as a general
principle, it seems clear that the scope of the fair use doctrine should be considerably narrower in the case of
newsletters than in that of either mass-circulation periodicals or scientific journals. The commercial nature of
the user is a significant factor in such cases: Copying by a profit-making user of even a small portion of a
newsletter may have a significant impact on the commercial market for the work.
The Committee has examined the use of excerpts from copyrighted works in the art work of calligraphers.
The committee believes that a single copy reproduction of an excerpt from a copyrighted work by a
calligrapher for a single client does not represent an infringement of copyright. Likewise, a single
reproduction of excerpts from a copyrighted work by a student calligrapher or teacher in a learning situation
would be a fair use of the copyrighted work.
The Register of Copyrights has recommended that the committee report describe the relationship between
this section and the provisions of section 108 relating to reproduction by libraries and archives. The doctrine
of fair use applies to library photocopying, and nothing contained in section 108 "in any way affects the right
of fair use." No provision of section 108 is intended to take away any rights existing under the fair use
doctrine. To the contrary, section 108 authorizes certain photocopying practices which may not qualify as a
fair use.
The criteria of fair use are necessarily set forth in general terms. In the application of the criteria of fair use
to specific photocopying practices of libraries, it is the intent of this legislation to provide an appropriate
balancing of the rights of creators, and the needs of users.

§108. Limitations on exclusive rights: Reproduction by libraries and archives
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this title and notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it
is not an infringement of copyright for a library or archives, or any of its employees acting within the
scope of their employment, to reproduce no more than one copy or phonorecord of a work, except as
provided in subsections (b) and (c), or to distribute such copy or phonorecord, under the conditions
specified by this section, if—
(1) the reproduction or distribution is made without any purpose of direct or indirect
commercial advantage;
(2) the collections of the library or archives are (i) open to the public, or (ii) available not only
to researchers affiliated with the library or archives or with the institution of which it is a part, but
also to other persons doing research in a specialized field; and
(3) the reproduction or distribution of the work includes a notice of copyright that appears on
the copy or phonorecord that is reproduced under the provisions of this section, or includes a
legend stating that the work may be protected by copyright if no such notice can be found on the
[Release Point 118-106]
copy or phonorecord that is reproduced under the provisions of this section.
(b) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this section apply to three copies or
phonorecords of an unpublished work duplicated solely for purposes of preservation and security or
for deposit for research use in another library or archives of the type described by clause (2) of
subsection (a), if—
(1) the copy or phonorecord reproduced is currently in the collections of the library or archives;
and
(2) any such copy or phonorecord that is reproduced in digital format is not otherwise
distributed in that format and is not made available to the public in that format outside the
premises of the library or archives.
(c) The right of reproduction under this section applies to three copies or phonorecords of a
published work duplicated solely for the purpose of replacement of a copy or phonorecord that is
damaged, deteriorating, lost, or stolen, or if the existing format in which the work is stored has
become obsolete, if—
(1) the library or archives has, after a reasonable effort, determined that an unused replacement
cannot be obtained at a fair price; and
(2) any such copy or phonorecord that is reproduced in digital format is not made available to
the public in that format outside the premises of the library or archives in lawful possession of
such copy.
For purposes of this subsection, a format shall be considered obsolete if the machine or device
necessary to render perceptible a work stored in that format is no longer manufactured or is no longer
reasonably available in the commercial marketplace.
(d) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this section apply to a copy, made from the
collection of a library or archives where the user makes his or her request or from that of another
library or archives, of no more than one article or other contribution to a copyrighted collection or
periodical issue, or to a copy or phonorecord of a small part of any other copyrighted work, if—
(1) the copy or phonorecord becomes the property of the user, and the library or archives has
had no notice that the copy or phonorecord would be used for any purpose other than private
study, scholarship, or research; and
(2) the library or archives displays prominently, at the place where orders are accepted, and
includes on its order form, a warning of copyright in accordance with requirements that the
Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
(e) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this section apply to the entire work, or to a
substantial part of it, made from the collection of a library or archives where the user makes his or
her request or from that of another library or archives, if the library or archives has first determined,
on the basis of a reasonable investigation, that a copy or phonorecord of the copyrighted work cannot
be obtained at a fair price, if—
(1) the copy or phonorecord becomes the property of the user, and the library or archives has
had no notice that the copy or phonorecord would be used for any purpose other than private
study, scholarship, or research; and
(2) the library or archives displays prominently, at the place where orders are accepted, and
includes on its order form, a warning of copyright in accordance with requirements that the
Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
(f) Nothing in this section—
(1) shall be construed to impose liability for copyright infringement upon a library or archives
or its employees for the unsupervised use of reproducing equipment located on its premises:
Provided, That such equipment displays a notice that the making of a copy may be subject to the
copyright law;
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) excuses a person who uses such reproducing equipment or who requests a copy or
phonorecord under subsection (d) from liability for copyright infringement for any such act, or for
any later use of such copy or phonorecord, if it exceeds fair use as provided by section 107;
(3) shall be construed to limit the reproduction and distribution by lending of a limited number
of copies and excerpts by a library or archives of an audiovisual news program, subject to clauses
(1), (2), and (3) of subsection (a); or
(4) in any way affects the right of fair use as provided by section 107, or any contractual
obligations assumed at any time by the library or archives when it obtained a copy or phonorecord
of a work in its collections.
(g) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this section extend to the isolated and
unrelated reproduction or distribution of a single copy or phonorecord of the same material on
separate occasions, but do not extend to cases where the library or archives, or its employee—
(1) is aware or has substantial reason to believe that it is engaging in the related or concerted
reproduction or distribution of multiple copies or phonorecords of the same material, whether
made on one occasion or over a period of time, and whether intended for aggregate use by one or
more individuals or for separate use by the individual members of a group; or
(2) engages in the systematic reproduction or distribution of single or multiple copies or
phonorecords of material described in subsection (d): Provided, That nothing in this clause
prevents a library or archives from participating in interlibrary arrangements that do not have, as
their purpose or effect, that the library or archives receiving such copies or phonorecords for
distribution does so in such aggregate quantities as to substitute for a subscription to or purchase
of such work.
(h)(1) For purposes of this section, during the last 20 years of any term of copyright of a published
work, a library or archives, including a nonprofit educational institution that functions as such, may
reproduce, distribute, display, or perform in facsimile or digital form a copy or phonorecord of such
work, or portions thereof, for purposes of preservation, scholarship, or research, if such library or
archives has first determined, on the basis of a reasonable investigation, that none of the conditions
set forth in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (2) apply.
(2) No reproduction, distribution, display, or performance is authorized under this subsection if—
(A) the work is subject to normal commercial exploitation;
(B) a copy or phonorecord of the work can be obtained at a reasonable price; or
(C) the copyright owner or its agent provides notice pursuant to regulations promulgated by the
Register of Copyrights that either of the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B) applies.
(3) The exemption provided in this subsection does not apply to any subsequent uses by users
other than such library or archives.
(i) The rights of reproduction and distribution under this section do not apply to a musical work, a
pictorial, graphic or sculptural work, or a motion picture or other audiovisual work other than an
audiovisual work dealing with news, except that no such limitation shall apply with respect to rights
granted by subsections (b), (c), and (h), or with respect to pictorial or graphic works published as
illustrations, diagrams, or similar adjuncts to works of which copies are reproduced or distributed in
accordance with subsections (d) and (e).

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Notwithstanding the exclusive rights of the owners of copyright, section 108 provides that under certain
conditions it is not an infringement of copyright for a library or archives, or any of its employees acting within
[Release Point 118-106]
the scope of their employment, to reproduce or distribute not more than one copy or phonorecord of a work,
provided (1) the reproduction or distribution is made without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial
advantage and (2) the collections of the library or archives are open to the public or available not only to
researchers affiliated with the library or archives, but also to other persons doing research in a specialized
field, and (3) the reproduction or distribution of the work includes a notice of copyright.
Under this provision, a purely commercial enterprise could not establish a collection of copyrighted works,
call itself a library or archive, and engage in for-profit reproduction and distribution of photocopies. Similarly,
it would not be possible for a non-profit institution, by means of contractual arrangements with a commercial
copying enterprise, to authorize the enterprise to carry out copying and distribution functions that would be
exempt if conducted by the non-profit institution itself.
The reference to "indirect commercial advantage" has raised questions as to the status of photocopying done
by or for libraries or archival collections within industrial, profit-making, or proprietary institutions (such as
the research and development departments of chemical, pharmaceutical, automobile, and oil corporations, the
library of a proprietary hospital, the collections owned by a law or medical partnership, etc.).
There is a direct interrelationship between this problem and the prohibitions against "multiple" and
"systematic" photocopying in section 108(g)(1) and (2). Under section 108, a library in a profitmaking
organization would not be authorized to:
(a) use a single subscription or copy to supply its employees with multiple copies of material relevant
to their work; or
(b) use a single subscription or copy to supply its employees, on request, with single copies of material
relevant to their work, where the arrangement is ''systematic" in the sense of deliberately substituting
photocopying for subscription or purchase; or
(c) use "interlibrary loan" arrangements for obtaining photocopies in such aggregate quantities as to
substitute for subscriptions or purchase of material needed by employees in their work.
Moreover, a library in a profit-making organization could not evade these obligations by installing
reproducing equipment on its premises for unsupervised use by the organization's staff.
Isolated, spontaneous making of single photocopies by a library in a for-profit organization, without any
systematic effort to substitute photocopying for subscriptions or purchases, would be covered by section 108,
even though the copies are furnished to the employees of the organization for use in their work. Similarly,
for-profit libraries could participate in interlibrary arrangements for exchange of photocopies, as long as the
reproduction or distribution was not "systematic." These activities, by themselves, would ordinarily not be
considered "for direct or indirect commercial advantage," since the "advantage" referred to in this clause must
attach to the immediate commercial motivation behind the reproduction or distribution itself, rather than to the
ultimate profit-making motivation behind the enterprise in which the library is located. On the other hand,
section 108 would not excuse reproduction or distribution if there were a commercial motive behind the actual
making or distributing of the copies, if multiple copies were made or distributed, or if the photocopying
activities were "systematic" in the sense that their aim was to substitute for subscriptions or purchases.
The rights of reproduction and distribution under section 108 apply in the following circumstances:
Archival Reproduction. Subsection (b) authorizes the reproduction and distribution of a copy or
phonorecord of an unpublished work duplicated in facsimile form solely for purposes of preservation and
security, or for deposit for research use in another library or archives, if the copy or phonorecord reproduced is
currently in the collections of the first library or archives. Only unpublished works could be reproduced under
this exemption, but the right would extend to any type of work, including photographs, motion pictures and
sound recordings. Under this exemption, for example, a repository could make photocopies of manuscripts by
microfilm or electrostatic process, but could not reproduce the work in "machine-readable" language for
storage in an information system.
Replacement of Damaged Copy. Subsection (c) authorizes the reproduction of a published work
duplicated in facsimile form solely for the purpose of replacement of a copy or phonorecord that is damaged,
deteriorating, lost or stolen, if the library or archives has, after a reasonable effort, determined that an unused
replacement cannot be obtained at a fair price. The scope and nature of a reasonable investigation to determine
that an unused replacement cannot be obtained will vary according to the circumstances of a particular
situation. It will always require recourse to commonly-known trade sources in the United States, and in the
normal situation also to the publisher or other copyright owner (if such owner can be located at the address
listed in the copyright registration), or an authorized reproducing service.
Articles and Small Excerpts. Subsection (d) authorizes the reproduction and distribution of a copy of not
more than one article or other contribution to a copyrighted collection or periodical issue, or of a copy or
phonorecord of a small part of any other copyrighted work. The copy or phonorecord may be made by the
library where the user makes his request or by another library pursuant to an interlibrary loan. It is further
[Release Point 118-106]
required that the copy become the property of the user, that the library or archives have no notice that the copy
would be used for any purposes other than private study, scholarship or research, and that the library or
archives display prominently at the place where reproduction requests are accepted, and includes in its order
form, a warning of copyright in accordance with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe
by regulation.
Out-of-Print Works. Subsection (e) authorizes the reproduction and distribution of a copy or phonorecord
of an entire work under certain circumstances, if it has been established that a copy cannot be obtained at a
fair price. The copy may be made by the library where the user makes his request or by another library
pursuant to an interlibrary loan. The scope and nature of a reasonable investigation to determine that an
unused copy cannot be obtained will vary according to the circumstances of a particular situation. It will
always require recourse to commonly-known trade sources in the United States, and in the normal situation
also to the publisher or other copyright owner (if the owner can be located at the address listed in the
copyright registration), or an authorized reproducing service. It is further required that the copy become the
property of the user, that the library or archives have no notice that the copy would be used for any purpose
other than private study, scholarship, or research, and that the library or archives display prominently at the
place where reproduction requests are accepted, and include on its order form, a warning of copyright in
accordance with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
General Exemptions. Clause (1) of subsection (f) specifically exempts a library or archives or its
employees from liability for the unsupervised use of reproducing equipment located on its premises, provided
that the reproducing equipment displays a notice that the making of a copy may be subject to the copyright
law. Clause (2) of subsection (f) makes clear that this exemption of the library or archives does not extend to
the person using such equipment or requesting such copy if the use exceeds fair use. Insofar as such person is
concerned the copy or phonorecord made is not considered "lawfully" made for purposes of sections 109, 110
or other provisions of the title.
Clause (3) provides that nothing in section 108 is intended to limit the reproduction and distribution by
lending of a limited number of copies and excerpts of an audiovisual news program. This exemption is
intended to apply to the daily newscasts of the national television networks, which report the major events of
the day. It does not apply to documentary (except documentary programs involving news reporting as that
term is used in section 107), magazine-format or other public affairs broadcasts dealing with subjects of
general interest to the viewing public.
The clause was first added to the revision bill in 1974 by the adoption of an amendment proposed by
Senator Baker. It is intended to permit libraries and archives, subject to the general conditions of this section,
to make off-the-air videotape recordings of daily network news casts for limited distribution to scholars and
researchers for use in research purposes. As such, it is an adjunct to the American Television and Radio
Archive established in Section 113 of the Act [2 U.S.C. 170] which will be the principal repository for
television broadcast material, including news broadcasts, the inclusion of language indicating that such
material may only be distributed by lending by the library or archive is intended to preclude performance,
copying, or sale, whether or not for profit, by the recipient of a copy of a television broadcast taped off-the-air
pursuant to this clause.
Clause (4), in addition to asserting that nothing contained in section 108 "affects the right of fair use as
provided by section 107", also provides that the right of reproduction granted by this section does not override
any contractual arrangements assumed by a library or archives when it obtained a work for its collections: For
example, if there is an express contractual prohibition against reproduction for any purpose, this legislation
shall not be construed as justifying a violation of the contract. This clause is intended to encompass the
situation where an individual makes papers, manuscripts or other works available to a library with the
understanding that they will not be reproduced.
It is the intent of this legislation that a subsequent unlawful use by a user of a copy or phonorecord of a
work lawfully made by a library, shall not make the library liable for such improper use.
Multiple Copies and Systematic Reproduction. Subsection (g) provides that the rights granted by this
section extend only to the "isolated and unrelated reproduction of a single copy or phonorecord of the same
material on separate occasions." However, this section does not authorize the related or concerted
reproduction of multiple copies or phonorecords of the same material, whether made on one occasion or over
a period of time, and whether intended for aggregate use by one individual or for separate use by the
individual members of a group.
With respect to material described in subsection (d)—articles or other contributions to periodicals or
collections, and small parts of other copyrighted works—subsection (g)(2) provides that the exemptions of
section 108 do not apply if the library or archive engages in "systematic reproduction or distribution of single
or multiple copies or phonorecords." This provision in S. 22 provoked a storm of controversy, centering
[Release Point 118-106]
around the extent to which the restrictions on "systematic" activities would prevent the continuation and
development of interlibrary networks and other arrangements involving the exchange of photocopies. After
thorough consideration, the Committee amended section 108(g)(2) to add the following proviso:
Provided, that nothing in this clause prevents a library or archives from participating in interlibrary
arrangements that do not have, as their purpose or effect, that the library or archives receiving such copies
or phonorecords for distribution does so in such aggregate quantities as to substitute for a subscription to or
purchase of such work.
In addition, the Committee added a new subsection (i) to section 108 [this section], requiring the Register of
Copyrights, five years from the effective date of the new Act and at five-year intervals thereafter, to report to
Congress upon "the extent to which this section has achieved the intended statutory balancing of the rights of
creators, and the needs of users," and to make appropriate legislative or other recommendations. As noted in
connection with section 107, the Committee also amended section 504(c) in a way that would insulate
librarians from unwarranted liability for copyright infringement; this amendment is discussed below.
The key phrases in the Committee's amendment of section 108(g)(2) are "aggregate quantities" and
"substitute for a subscription to or purchase of" a work. To be implemented effectively in practice, these
provisions will require the development and implementation of more-or-less specific guidelines establishing
criteria to govern various situations.
The National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) offered to provide
good offices in helping to develop these guidelines. This offer was accepted and, although the final text of
guidelines has not yet been achieved, the Committee has reason to hope that, within the next month, some
agreement can be reached on an initial set of guidelines covering practices under section 108(g)(2).
Works Excluded. Subsection (h) provides that the rights of reproduction and distribution under this section
do not apply to a musical work, a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work, or a motion picture or other
audiovisual work other than "an audiovisual work dealing with news." The latter term is intended as the
equivalent in meaning of the phrase "audiovisual news program" in section 108(f)(3). The exclusions under
subsection (h) do not apply to archival reproduction under subsection (b), to replacement of damaged or lost
copies or phonorecords under subsection (c), or to "pictorial or graphic works published as illustrations,
diagrams, or similar adjuncts to works of which copies are reproduced or distributed in accordance with
subsections (d) and (e)."
Although subsection (h) generally removes musical, graphic, and audiovisual works from the specific
exemptions of section 108, it is important to recognize that the doctrine of fair use under section 107 remains
fully applicable to the photocopying or other reproduction of such works. In the case of music, for example, it
would be fair use for a scholar doing musicological research to have a library supply a copy of a portion of a
score or to reproduce portions of a phonorecord of a work. Nothing in section 108 impairs the applicability of
the fair use doctrine to a wide variety of situations involving photocopying or other reproduction by a library
of copyrighted material in its collections, where the user requests the reproduction for legitimate scholarly or
research purposes.

without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that
copy or phonorecord. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, copies or phonorecords of works
subject to restored copyright under section 104A that are manufactured before the date of restoration
of copyright or, with respect to reliance parties, before publication or service of notice under section
104A(e), may be sold or otherwise disposed of without the authorization of the owner of the restored
copyright for purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage only during the 12-month period
beginning on—
(1) the date of the publication in the Federal Register of the notice of intent filed with the
Copyright Office under section 104A(d)(2)(A), or
(2) the date of the receipt of actual notice served under section 104A(d)(2)(B),
whichever occurs first.
(b)(1)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), unless authorized by the owners of
copyright in the sound recording or the owner of copyright in a computer program (including any
tape, disk, or other medium embodying such program), and in the case of a sound recording in the
musical works embodied therein, neither the owner of a particular phonorecord nor any person in
possession of a particular copy of a computer program (including any tape, disk, or other medium
embodying such program), may, for the purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage, dispose
of, or authorize the disposal of, the possession of that phonorecord or computer program (including
[Release Point 118-106]
any tape, disk, or other medium embodying such program) by rental, lease, or lending, or by any
other act or practice in the nature of rental, lease, or lending. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall
apply to the rental, lease, or lending of a phonorecord for nonprofit purposes by a nonprofit library or
nonprofit educational institution. The transfer of possession of a lawfully made copy of a computer
program by a nonprofit educational institution to another nonprofit educational institution or to
faculty, staff, and students does not constitute rental, lease, or lending for direct or indirect
commercial purposes under this subsection.
(B) This subsection does not apply to—
(i) a computer program which is embodied in a machine or product and which cannot be copied
during the ordinary operation or use of the machine or product; or
(ii) a computer program embodied in or used in conjunction with a limited purpose computer
that is designed for playing video games and may be designed for other purposes.
(C) Nothing in this subsection affects any provision of chapter 9 of this title.
(2)(A) Nothing in this subsection shall apply to the lending of a computer program for nonprofit
purposes by a nonprofit library, if each copy of a computer program which is lent by such library has
affixed to the packaging containing the program a warning of copyright in accordance with
requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
(B) Not later than three years after the date of the enactment of the Computer Software Rental
Amendments Act of 1990, and at such times thereafter as the Register of Copyrights considers
appropriate, the Register of Copyrights, after consultation with representatives of copyright owners
and librarians, shall submit to the Congress a report stating whether this paragraph has achieved its
intended purpose of maintaining the integrity of the copyright system while providing nonprofit
libraries the capability to fulfill their function. Such report shall advise the Congress as to any
information or recommendations that the Register of Copyrights considers necessary to carry out the
purposes of this subsection.
(3) Nothing in this subsection shall affect any provision of the antitrust laws. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, "antitrust laws" has the meaning given that term in the first section of the
Clayton Act and includes section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to the extent that section
relates to unfair methods of competition.
(4) Any person who distributes a phonorecord or a copy of a computer program (including any
tape, disk, or other medium embodying such program) in violation of paragraph (1) is an infringer of
copyright under section 501 of this title and is subject to the remedies set forth in sections 502, 503,
504, and 505. Such violation shall not be a criminal offense under section 506 or cause such person
to be subject to the criminal penalties set forth in section 2319 of title 18.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(5), the owner of a particular copy lawfully made
under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the
copyright owner, to display that copy publicly, either directly or by the projection of no more than
one image at a time, to viewers present at the place where the copy is located.
(d) The privileges prescribed by subsections (a) and (c) do not, unless authorized by the copyright
owner, extend to any person who has acquired possession of the copy or phonorecord from the
copyright owner, by rental, lease, loan, or otherwise, without acquiring ownership of it.
(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106(4) and 106(5), in the case of an electronic
audiovisual game intended for use in coin-operated equipment, the owner of a particular copy of
such a game lawfully made under this title, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner
of the game, to publicly perform or display that game in coin-operated equipment, except that this
subsection shall not apply to any work of authorship embodied in the audiovisual game if the
copyright owner of the electronic audiovisual game is not also the copyright owner of the work of
authorship.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Effect on Further Disposition of Copy or Phonorecord. Section 109(a) restates and confirms the
principle that, where the copyright owner has transferred ownership of a particular copy or phonorecord of a
work, the person to whom the copy or phonorecord is transferred is entitled to dispose of it by sale, rental, or
any other means. Under this principle, which has been established by the court decisions and section 27 of the
present law [section 27 of former title 17], the copyright owner's exclusive right of public distribution would
have no effect upon anyone who owns "a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title" and
who wishes to transfer it to someone else or to destroy it.
Thus, for example, the outright sale of an authorized copy of a book frees it from any copyright control over
its resale price or other conditions of its future disposition. A library that has acquired ownership of a copy is
entitled to lend it under any conditions it chooses to impose. This does not mean that conditions on future
disposition of copies or phonorecords, imposed by a contract between their buyer and seller, would be
unenforceable between the parties as a breach of contract, but it does mean that they could not be enforced by
an action for infringement of copyright. Under section 202 however, the owner of the physical copy or
phonorecord cannot reproduce or perform the copyrighted work publicly without the copyright owner's
consent.
To come within the scope of section 109(a), a copy or phonorecord must have been "lawfully made under
this title," though not necessarily with the copyright owner's authorization. For example, any resale of an
illegally "pirated" phonorecord would be an infringement, but the disposition of a phonorecord legally made
under the compulsory licensing provisions of section 115 would not.
Effect on Display of Copy. Subsection (b) of section 109 deals with the scope of the copyright owner's
exclusive right to control the public display of a particular "copy" of a work (including the original or
prototype copy in which the work was first fixed). Assuming, for example, that a painter has sold the only
copy of an original work of art without restrictions, would it be possible for him to restrain the new owner
from displaying it publicly in galleries, shop windows, on a projector, or on television?
Section 109(b) adopts the general principle that the lawful owner of a copy of a work should be able to put
his copy on public display without the consent of the copyright owner. As in cases arising under section
109(a), this does not mean that contractual restrictions on display between a buyer and seller would be
unenforceable as a matter of contract law.
The exclusive right of public display granted by section 106(5) would not apply where the owner of a copy
wishes to show it directly to the public, as in a gallery or display case, or indirectly, as through an opaque
projector. Where the copy itself is intended for projection, as in the case of a photographic slide, negative, or
transparency, the public projection of a single image would be permitted as long as the viewers are "present at
the place where the copy is located."
On the other hand, section 109(b) takes account of the potentialities of the new communications media,
notably television, cable and optical transmission devices, and information storage and retrieval devices, for
replacing printed copies with visual images. First of all, the public display of an image of a copyrighted work
would not be exempted from copyright control if the copy from which the image was derived were outside the
presence of the viewers. In other words, the display of a visual image of a copyrighted work would be an
infringement if the image were transmitted by any method (by closed or open circuit television, for example,
or by a computer system) from one place to members of the public located elsewhere.
Moreover, the exemption would extend only to public displays that are made "either directly or by the
projection of no more than one image at a time." Thus, even where the copy and the viewers are located at the
same place, the simultaneous projection of multiple images of the work would not be exempted. For example,
where each person in a lecture hall is supplied with a separate viewing apparatus, the copyright owner's
permission would generally be required in order to project an image of a work on each individual screen at the
same time.
The committee's intention is to preserve the traditional privilege of the owner of a copy to display it
directly, but to place reasonable restrictions on the ability to display it indirectly in such a way that the
copyright owner's market for reproduction and distribution of copies would be affected. Unless it constitutes a
fair use under section 107, or unless one of the special provisions of section 110 or 111 is applicable,
projection of more than one image at a time, or transmission of an image to the public over television or other
[Release Point 118-106]
communication channels, would be an infringement for the same reasons that reproduction in copies would
be. The concept of "the place where the copy is located" is generally intended to refer to a situation in which
the viewers are present in the same physical surroundings as the copy, even though they cannot see the copy
directly.
Effect of Mere Possession of Copy or Phonorecord. Subsection (c) of section 109 qualifies the privileges
specified in subsections (a) and (b) by making clear that they do not apply to someone who merely possesses a
copy or phonorecord without having acquired ownership of it. Acquisition of an object embodying a
copyrighted work by rental, lease, loan, or bailment carries with it no privilege to dispose of the copy under
section 109(a) or to display it publicly under section 109(b). To cite a familiar example, a person who has
rented a print of a motion picture from the copyright owner would have no right to rent it to someone else
without the owner's permission.
Burden of Proof in Infringement Actions. During the course of its deliberations on this section, the
Committee's attention was directed to a recent court decision holding that the plaintiff in an infringement
action had the burden of establishing that the allegedly infringing copies in the defendant's possession were
not lawfully made or acquired under section 27 of the present law [section 27 of former title 17]. American
International Pictures, Inc. v. Foreman, 400 F.Supp. 928 (S.D.Alabama 1975). The Committee believes that
the court's decision, if followed, would place a virtually impossible burden on copyright owners. The decision
is also inconsistent with the established legal principle that the burden of proof should not be placed upon a
litigant to establish facts particularly within the knowledge of his adversary. The defendant in such actions
clearly has the particular knowledge of how possession of the particular copy was acquired, and should have
the burden of providing this evidence to the court. It is the intent of the Committee, therefore, that in an action
to determine whether a defendant is entitled to the privilege established by section 109(a) and (b), the burden
of proving whether a particular copy was lawfully made or acquired should rest on the defendant.

exhibition, but shall not excuse any such person from liability for the performance;
(7) performance of a nondramatic musical work by a vending establishment open to the public

transmission is made through the facilities of: (i) a governmental body; or (ii) a noncommercial
educational broadcast station (as defined in section 397 of title 47); or (iii) a radio subcarrier
authorization (as defined in 47 CFR 73.293–73.295 and 73.593–73.595); or (iv) a cable system (as
defined in section 111(f));
(9) performance on a single occasion of a dramatic literary work published at least ten years
before the date of the performance, by or in the course of a transmission specifically designed for
and primarily directed to blind or other handicapped persons who are unable to read normal
printed material as a result of their handicap, if the performance is made without any purpose of
direct or indirect commercial advantage and its transmission is made through the facilities of a
radio subcarrier authorization referred to in clause (8)(iii), Provided, That the provisions of this
clause shall not be applicable to more than one performance of the same work by the same
performers or under the auspices of the same organization;
(10) notwithstanding paragraph (4), the following is not an infringement of copyright:
performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work in the course of a social function which is
organized and promoted by a nonprofit veterans' organization or a nonprofit fraternal organization
to which the general public is not invited, but not including the invitees of the organizations, if the
proceeds from the performance, after deducting the reasonable costs of producing the
performance, are used exclusively for charitable purposes and not for financial gain. For purposes
of this section the social functions of any college or university fraternity or sorority shall not be
included unless the social function is held solely to raise funds for a specific charitable purpose;
and
(11) the making imperceptible, by or at the direction of a member of a private household, of
limited portions of audio or video content of a motion picture, during a performance in or
[Release Point 118-106]
transmitted to that household for private home viewing, from an authorized copy of the motion
picture, or the creation or provision of a computer program or other technology that enables such
making imperceptible and that is designed and marketed to be used, at the direction of a member
of a private household, for such making imperceptible, if no fixed copy of the altered version of
the motion picture is created by such computer program or other technology.
The exemptions provided under paragraph (5) shall not be taken into account in any
administrative, judicial, or other governmental proceeding to set or adjust the royalties payable to
copyright owners for the public performance or display of their works. Royalties payable to
copyright owners for any public performance or display of their works other than such performances
or displays as are exempted under paragraph (5) shall not be diminished in any respect as a result of
such exemption.
In paragraph (2), the term "mediated instructional activities" with respect to the performance or
display of a work by digital transmission under this section refers to activities that use such work
as an integral part of the class experience, controlled by or under the actual supervision of the
instructor and analogous to the type of performance or display that would take place in a live
classroom setting. The term does not refer to activities that use, in 1 or more class sessions of a
single course, such works as textbooks, course packs, or other material in any media, copies or
phonorecords of which are typically purchased or acquired by the students in higher education for
their independent use and retention or are typically purchased or acquired for elementary and
secondary students for their possession and independent use.
For purposes of paragraph (2), accreditation—
(A) with respect to an institution providing post-secondary education, shall be as determined
by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the Council on Higher Education
Accreditation or the United States Department of Education; and
(B) with respect to an institution providing elementary or secondary education, shall be as
recognized by the applicable state certification or licensing procedures.
For purposes of paragraph (2), no governmental body or accredited nonprofit educational
institution shall be liable for infringement by reason of the transient or temporary storage of
material carried out through the automatic technical process of a digital transmission of the
performance or display of that material as authorized under paragraph (2). No such material stored
on the system or network controlled or operated by the transmitting body or institution under this
paragraph shall be maintained on such system or network in a manner ordinarily accessible to
anyone other than anticipated recipients. No such copy shall be maintained on the system or
network in a manner ordinarily accessible to such anticipated recipients for a longer period than is
reasonably necessary to facilitate the transmissions for which it was made.
For purposes of paragraph (11), the term "making imperceptible" does not include the addition
of audio or video content that is performed or displayed over or in place of existing content in a
motion picture.
Nothing in paragraph (11) shall be construed to imply further rights under section 106 of this
title, or to have any effect on defenses or limitations on rights granted under any other section of
this title or under any other paragraph of this section.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Clauses (1) through (4) of section 110 deal with performances and exhibitions that are now generally
exempt under the "for profit" limitation or other provisions of the copyright law, and that are specifically
[Release Point 118-106]
exempted from copyright liability under this legislation. Clauses (1) and (2) between them are intended to
cover all of the various methods by which performances or displays in the course of systematic instruction
take place.
Face-to-Face Teaching Activities. Clause (1) of section 110 is generally intended to set out the conditions
under which performances or displays, in the course of instructional activities other than educational
broadcasting, are to be exempted from copyright control. The clause covers all types of copyrighted works,
and exempts their performance or display "by instructors or pupils in the course of face-to-face teaching
activities of a nonprofit educational institution," where the activities take place "in a classroom or similar
place devoted to instruction."
There appears to be no need for a statutory definition of "face-to-face" teaching activities to clarify the
scope of the provision. "Face-to-face teaching activities" under clause (1) embrace instructional performances
and displays that are not "transmitted." The concept does not require that the teacher and students be able to
see each other, although it does require their simultaneous presence in the same general place. Use of the
phrase "in the course of face-to-face teaching activities" is intended to exclude broadcasting or other
transmissions from an outside location into classrooms, whether radio or television and whether open or
closed circuit. However, as long as the instructor and pupils are in the same building or general area, the
exemption would extend to the use of devices for amplifying or reproducing sound and for projecting visual
images. The "teaching activities" exempted by the clause encompass systematic instruction of a very wide
variety of subjects, but they do not include performances or displays, whatever their cultural value or
intellectual appeal, that are given for the recreation or entertainment of any part of their audience.
Works Affected.—Since there is no limitation on the types of works covered by the exemption, teachers or
students would be free to perform or display anything in class as long as the other conditions of the clause are
met. They could read aloud from copyrighted text material, act out a drama, play or sing a musical work,
perform a motion picture or filmstrip, or display text or pictorial material to the class by means of a projector.
However, nothing in this provision is intended to sanction the unauthorized reproduction of copies or
phonorecords for the purpose of classroom performance or display, and the clause contains a special exception
dealing with performances from unlawfully made copies of motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to be
discussed below.
Instructors or Pupils.—To come within clause (1), the performance or display must be "by instructors or
pupils," thus ruling out performances by actors, singers, or instrumentalists brought in from outside the school
to put on a program. However, the term "instructors" would be broad enough to include guest lecturers if their
instructional activities remain confined to classroom situations. In general, the term "pupils" refers to the
enrolled members of a class.
Nonprofit Educational Institution.—Clause (1) makes clear that it applies only to the teaching activities "of
a nonprofit educational institution," thus excluding from the exemption performances or displays in
profit-making institutions such as dance studios and language schools.
Classroom or Similar Place.—The teaching activities exempted by the clause must take place "in a
classroom or similar place devoted to instruction." For example, performances in an auditorium or stadium
during a school assembly, graduation ceremony, class play, or sporting event, where the audience is not
confined to the members of a particular class, would fall outside the scope of clause (1), although in some
cases they might be exempted by clause (4) of section 110. The "similar place" referred to in clause (1) is a
place which is "devoted to instruction" in the same way a classroom is; common examples would include a
studio, a workshop, a gymnasium, a training field, a library, the stage of an auditorium, or the auditorium
itself, if it is actually used as a classroom for systematic instructional activities.
Motion Pictures and Other Audiovisual Works.—The final provision of clause (1) deals with the special
problem of performances from unlawfully-made copies of motion pictures and other audiovisual works. The
exemption is lost where the copy being used for a classroom performance was "not lawfully made under this
title" and the person responsible for the performance knew or had reason to suspect as much. This special
exception to the exemption would not apply to performances from lawfully-made copies, even if the copies
were acquired from someone who had stolen or converted them, or if the performances were in violation of an
agreement. However, though the performance would be exempt under section 110(1) in such cases, the
copyright owner might have a cause of action against the unauthorized distributor under section 106(3), or
against the person responsible for the performance, for breach of contract.
Projection Devices.—As long as there is no transmission beyond the place where the copy is located, both
section 109(b) and section 110(1) would permit the classroom display of a work by means of any sort of
projection device or process.
Instructional Broadcasting. Works Affected.—The exemption for instructional broadcasting provided by
section 110(2) would apply only to "performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work or display of a
[Release Point 118-106]
work." Thus, the copyright owner's permission would be required for the performance on educational
television or radio of a dramatic work, of a dramatico-musical work such as an opera or musical comedy, or of
a motion picture. Since, as already explained, audiovisual works such as filmstrips are equated with motion
pictures, their sequential showing would be regarded as a performance rather than a display and would not be
exempt under section 110(2). The clause is not intended to limit in any way the copyright owner's exclusive
right to make dramatizations, adaptations, or other derivative works under section 106(2). Thus, for example,
a performer could read a nondramatic literary work aloud under section 110(2), but the copyright owner's
permission would be required for him to act it out in dramatic form.
Systematic Instructional Activities.—Under section 110(2) a transmission must meet three specified
conditions in order to be exempted from copyright liability. The first of these, as provided by subclause (A), is
that the performance or display must be "a regular part of the systematic instructional activities of a
governmental body or a nonprofit educational institution." The concept of "systematic instructional activities"
is intended as the general equivalent of "curriculums," but it could be broader in a case such as that of an
institution using systematic teaching methods not related to specific course work. A transmission would be a
regular part of these activities if it is in accordance with the pattern of teaching established by the
governmental body or institution. The use of commercial facilities, such as those of a cable service, to transmit
the performance or display, would not affect the exemption as long as the actual performance or display was
for nonprofit purposes.
Content of Transmission.—Subclause (B) requires that the performance or display be directly related and of
material assistance to the teaching content of the transmission.
Intended Recipients.—Subclause (C) requires that the transmission is made primarily for:
(i) Reception in classrooms or similar places normally devoted to instruction, or
(ii) Reception by persons to whom the transmission is directed because their disabilities or other
special circumstances prevent their attendance in classrooms or similar places normally devoted to
instruction, or
(iii) Reception by officers or employees of governmental bodies as a part of their official duties or
employment.
In all three cases, the instructional transmission need only be made "primarily" rather than "solely" to the
specified recipients to be exempt. Thus, the transmission could still be exempt even though it is capable of
reception by the public at large. Conversely, it would not be regarded as made "primarily" for one of the
required groups of recipients if the principal purpose behind the transmission is reception by the public at
large, even if it is cast in the form of instruction and is also received in classrooms. Factors to consider in
determining the "primary" purpose of a program would include its subject matter, content, and the time of its
transmission.
Paragraph (i) of subclause (C) generally covers what are known as "in-school" broadcasts, whether open- or
closed-circuit. The reference to "classrooms or similar places" here is intended to have the same meaning as
that of the phrase as used in section 110(1). The exemption in paragraph (ii) is intended to exempt
transmissions providing systematic instruction to individuals who cannot be reached in classrooms because of
"their disabilities or other special circumstances." Accordingly, the exemption is confined to instructional
broadcasting that is an adjunct to the actual classwork of nonprofit schools or is primarily for people who
cannot be brought together in classrooms such as preschool children, displaced workers, illiterates, and
shut-ins.
There has been some question as to whether or not the language in this section of the bill is intended to
include instructional television college credit courses. These telecourses are aimed at undergraduate and
graduate students in earnest pursuit of higher educational degrees who are unable to attend daytime classes
because of daytime employment, distance from campus, or some other intervening reason. So long as these
broadcasts are aimed at regularly enrolled students and conducted by recognized higher educational
institutions, the committee believes that they are clearly within the language of section 110(2)(C)(ii). Like
night school and correspondence courses before them, these telecourses are fast becoming a valuable adjunct
of the normal college curriculum.
The third exemption in subclause (C) is intended to permit the use of copyrighted material, in accordance
with the other conditions of section 110(2), in the course of instructional transmissions for Government
personnel who are receiving training "as a part of their official duties or employment."
Religious Services. The exemption in clause (3) of section 110 covers performances of a nondramatic
literary or musical work, and also performances "of dramatico-musical works of a religious nature"; in
addition, it extends to displays of works of all kinds. The exemption applies where the performance or display
is "in the course of services at a place of worship or other religious assembly." The scope of the clause does
not cover the sequential showing of motion pictures and other audiovisual works.
[Release Point 118-106]
The exemption, which to some extent has its counterpart in sections 1 and 104 of the present law [sections 1
and 104 of former title 17], applies to dramatico-musical works "of a religious nature." The purpose here is to
exempt certain performances of sacred music that might be regarded as "dramatic" in nature, such as oratorios,
cantatas, musical settings of the mass, choral services, and the like. The exemption is not intended to cover
performances of secular operas, musical plays, motion pictures, and the like, even if they have an underlying
religious or philosophical theme and take place "in the course of [religious] services."
To be exempted under section 110(3) a performance or display must be "in the course of services," thus
excluding activities at a place of worship that are for social, educational, fund raising, or entertainment
purposes. Some performances of these kinds could be covered by the exemption in section 110(4), discussed
next. Since the performance or display must also occur "at a place of worship or other religious assembly," the
exemption would not extend to religious broadcasts or other transmissions to the public at large, even where
the transmissions were sent from the place of worship. On the other hand, as long as services are being
conducted before a religious gathering, the exemption would apply if they were conducted in places such as
auditoriums, outdoor theaters, and the like.
Certain Other Nonprofit Performances. In addition to the educational and religious exemptions provided
by clauses (1) through (3) of section 110, clause (4) contains a general exception to the exclusive right of
public performance that would cover some, though not all, of the same ground as the present "for profit"
limitation.
Scope of Exemption.—The exemption in clause (4) applies to the same general activities and subject matter
as those covered by the "for profit" limitation today: public performances of nondramatic literary and musical
works. However, the exemption would be limited to public performances given directly in the presence of an
audience whether by means of living performers, the playing of phonorecords, or the operation of a receiving
apparatus, and would not include a "transmission to the public." Unlike the clauses (1) through (3) and (5) of
section 110, but like clauses (6) through (8), clause (4) applies only to performing rights in certain works, and
does not affect the exclusive right to display a work in public.
No Profit Motive.—In addition to the other conditions specified by the clause, the performance must be
"without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage." This provision expressly adopts the
principle established by the court decisions construing the "for profit" limitation: that public performances
given or sponsored in connection with any commercial or profit-making enterprises are subject to the
exclusive rights of the copyright owner even though the public is not charged for seeing or hearing the
performance.
No Payment for Performance.—An important condition for this exemption is that the performance be given
"without payment of any fee or other compensation for the performance to any of its performers, promoters, or
organizers." The basic purpose of this requirement is to prevent the free use of copyrighted material under the
guise of charity where fees or percentages are paid to performers, promoters, producers, and the like.
However, the exemption would not be lost if the performers, directors, or producers of the performance,
instead of being paid directly "for the performance," are paid a salary for duties encompassing the
performance. Examples are performances by a school orchestra conducted by a music teacher who receives an
annual salary, or by a service band whose members and conductors perform as part of their assigned duties
and who receive military pay. The committee believes that performances of this type should be exempt,
assuming the other conditions in clause (4) are met, and has not adopted the suggestion that the word "salary"
be added to the phrase referring to the "payment of any fee or other compensation."
Admission Charge.—Assuming that the performance involves no profit motive and no one responsible for it
gets paid a fee, it must still meet one of two alternative conditions to be exempt. As specified in subclauses
(A) and (B) of section 110(4), these conditions are: (1) that no direct or indirect admission charge is made, or
(2) that the net proceeds are "used exclusively for educational, religious, or charitable purposes and not for
private financial gain."
Under the second of these conditions, a performance meeting the other conditions of clause (4) would be
exempt even if an admission fee is charged, provided any amounts left "after deducting the reasonable costs of
producing the performance" are used solely for bona fide educational, religious, or charitable purposes. In
cases arising under this second condition and as provided in subclause (B), where there is an admission
charge, the copyright owner is given an opportunity to decide whether and under what conditions the
copyrighted work should be performed; otherwise, owners could be compelled to make involuntary donations
to the fund-raising activities of causes to which they are opposed. The subclause would thus permit copyright
owners to prevent public performances of their works under section 110(4)(B) by serving notice of objection,
with the reasons therefor, at least seven days in advance.
Mere Reception in Public. Unlike the first four clauses of section 110, clause (5) is not to any extent a
counterpart of the "for profit" limitation of the present statute. It applies to performances and displays of all
[Release Point 118-106]
types of works, and its purpose is to exempt from copyright liability anyone who merely turns on, in a public
place, an ordinary radio or television receiving apparatus of a kind commonly sold to members of the public
for private use.
The basic rationale of this clause is that the secondary use of the transmission by turning on an ordinary
receiver in public is so remote and minimal that no further liability should be imposed. In the vast majority of
these cases no royalties are collected today, and the exemption should be made explicit in the statute. This
clause has nothing to do with cable television systems and the exemptions would be denied in any case where
the audience is charged directly to see or hear the transmission.
With respect to section 110(5), the conference substitute conforms to the language in the Senate bill. It is
the intent of the conferees that a small commercial establishment of the type involved in Twentieth Century
Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151 (1975), [95 S.Ct. 2040, 45 L.Ed.2d 84], which merely augmented a
home-type receiver and which was not of sufficient size to justify, as a practical matter, a subscription to a
commercial background music service, would be exempt. However, where the public communication was by
means of something other than a home-type receiving apparatus, or where the establishment actually makes a
further transmission to the public, the exemption would not apply.
On June 17, 1975, the Supreme Court handed down a decision in Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken,
95 S.Ct. 2040 [422 U.S. 151, 45 L.Ed.2d 84], that raised fundamental questions about the proper interpretation
of section 110(5). The defendant, owner and operator of a fast-service food shop in downtown Pittsburgh, had
"a radio with outlets to four speakers in the ceiling," which he apparently turned on and left on throughout the
business day. Lacking any performing license, he was sued for copyright infringement by two ASCAP
members. He lost in the District Court, won a reversal in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and finally
prevailed, by a margin of 7–2, in the Supreme Court.
The Aiken decision is based squarely on the two Supreme Court decisions dealing with cable television. In
Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists, 392 U.S. 390 [88 S.Ct. 2084, 20 L.Ed.2d 1176, rehearing denied 89 S.Ct.
65, 393 U.S. 902, 21 L.Ed.2d 190], and again in Teleprompter Corp. v. CBS, 415 U.S. 394 [94 S.Ct. 1129, 39
L.Ed.2d 415], the Supreme Court has held that a CATV operator was not "performing" within the meaning of
the 1909 statute, when it picked up broadcast signals off the air and retransmitted them to subscribers by
cable. The Aiken decision extends this interpretation of the scope of the 1909 statute's right of "public
performance for profit" to a situation outside the CATV context and, without expressly overruling the decision
in Buck v. Jewell-LaSalle Realty Co., 283 U.S. 191 (1931) [51 S.Ct. 410, 75 L.Ed. 971], effectively deprives it
of much meaning under the present law. For more than forty years the Jewell-LaSalle rule was thought to
require a business establishment to obtain copyright licenses before it could legally pick up any broadcasts off
the air and retransmit them to its guests and patrons. As reinterpreted by the Aiken decision, the rule of
Jewell-LaSalle applies only if the broadcast being retransmitted was itself unlicensed.
The majority of the Supreme Court in the Aiken case based its decision on a narrow construction of the
word "perform" in the 1909 statute. This basis for the decision is completely overturned by the present bill and
its broad definition of "perform" in section 101. The Committee has adopted the language of section 110(5)
with an amendment expressly denying the exemption in situations where "the performance or display is
further transmitted beyond the place where the receiving apparatus is located"; in doing so, it accepts the
traditional, pre-Aiken, interpretation of the Jewell-LaSalle decision, under which public communication by
means other than a home receiving set, or further transmission of a broadcast to the public, is considered an
infringing act.
Under the particular fact situation in the Aiken case, assuming a small commercial establishment and the
use of a home receiver with four ordinary loudspeakers grouped within a relatively narrow circumference
from the set, it is intended that the performances would be exempt under clause (5). However, the Committee
considers this fact situation to represent the outer limit of the exemption, and believes that the line should be
drawn at that point. Thus, the clause would exempt small commercial establishments whose proprietors
merely bring onto their premises standard radio or television equipment and turn it on for their customers'
enjoyment, but it would impose liability where the proprietor has a commercial "sound system" installed or
converts a standard home receiving apparatus (by augmenting it with sophisticated or extensive amplification
equipment) into the equivalent of a commercial sound system. Factors to consider in particular cases would
include the size, physical arrangement, and noise level of the areas within the establishment where the
transmissions are made audible or visible, and the extent to which the receiving apparatus is altered or
augmented for the purpose of improving the aural or visual quality of the performance for individual members
of the public using those areas.
Agricultural Fairs. The Committee also amended clause (6) of section 110 of S. 22 as adopted by the
Senate. As amended, the provision would exempt "performance of a nondramatic musical work by a
governmental body or a nonprofit agricultural or horticultural organization, in the course of an annual
[Release Point 118-106]
agricultural or horticultural fair or exhibition conducted by such body or organization." The exemption
extends only to the governmental body or nonprofit organization sponsoring the fair; the amendment makes
clear that, while such a body or organization cannot itself be held vicariously liable for infringements by
concessionaires at the fair, the concessionaires themselves enjoy no exemption under the clause.
Retail Sale of Phonorecords. Clause (7) provides that the performance of a nondramatic musical work or
of a sound recording by a vending establishment open to the public at large without any direct or indirect
admission charge, where the sole purpose of the performance is to promote the retail sale of copies or
phonorecords of the work, is not an infringement of copyright. This exemption applies only if the performance
is not transmitted beyond the place where the establishment is located and is within the immediate area where
the sale is occurring.
Transmission to Handicapped Audiences. The new clause (8) of subsection 110, which had been added
to S. 22 by the Senate Judiciary Committee when it reported the bill on November 20, 1975, and had been
adopted by the Senate on February 19, 1976, was substantially amended by the Committee. Under the
amendment, the exemption would apply only to performances of "nondramatic literary works" by means of "a
transmission specifically designed for and primarily directed to" one or the other of two defined classes of
handicapped persons: (1) "blind or other handicapped persons who are unable to read normal printed material
as a result of their handicap" or (2) "deaf or other handicapped persons who are unable to hear the aural
signals accompanying a transmission." Moreover, the exemption would be applicable only if the performance
is "without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage," and if the transmission takes place
through government facilities or through the facilities of a noncommercial educational broadcast station, a
radio subcarrier authorization (SCA), or a cable system.

§111. Limitations on exclusive rights: Secondary transmissions of broadcast
programming by cable
(a) CERTAIN SECONDARY TRANSMISSIONS EXEMPTED.—The secondary transmission of
a performance or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission is not an infringement of
copyright if—
(1) the secondary transmission is not made by a cable system, and consists entirely of the
relaying, by the management of a hotel, apartment house, or similar establishment, of signals
transmitted by a broadcast station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, within
the local service area of such station, to the private lodgings of guests or residents of such
establishment, and no direct charge is made to see or hear the secondary transmission; or
(2) the secondary transmission is made solely for the purpose and under the conditions specified
by paragraph (2) of section 110; or
(3) the secondary transmission is made by any carrier who has no direct or indirect control over
the content or selection of the primary transmission or over the particular recipients of the
secondary transmission, and whose activities with respect to the secondary transmission consist
solely of providing wires, cables, or other communications channels for the use of others:
Provided, That the provisions of this paragraph extend only to the activities of said carrier with
respect to secondary transmissions and do not exempt from liability the activities of others with
respect to their own primary or secondary transmissions;
(4) the secondary transmission is made by a satellite carrier pursuant to a statutory license under
section 119 or section 122;
(5) the secondary transmission is not made by a cable system but is made by a governmental
body, or other nonprofit organization, without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial
advantage, and without charge to the recipients of the secondary transmission other than
assessments necessary to defray the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the
secondary transmission service.
(b) SECONDARY TRANSMISSION OF PRIMARY TRANSMISSION TO CONTROLLED
GROUP.—Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c), the secondary transmission to
the public of a performance or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission is actionable as
an act of infringement under section 501, and is fully subject to the remedies provided by sections
502 through 506, if the primary transmission is not made for reception by the public at large but is
controlled and limited to reception by particular members of the public: Provided, however, That
such secondary transmission is not actionable as an act of infringement if—
(1) the primary transmission is made by a broadcast station licensed by the Federal
Communications Commission; and
(2) the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary transmission is required under the rules,
regulations, or authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission; and
(3) the signal of the primary transmitter is not altered or changed in any way by the secondary
transmitter.
(c) SECONDARY TRANSMISSIONS BY CABLE SYSTEMS.—
(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection and section
[Release Point 118-106]
114(d), secondary transmissions to the public by a cable system of a performance or display of a
work embodied in a primary transmission made by a broadcast station licensed by the Federal
Communications Commission or by an appropriate governmental authority of Canada or Mexico
shall be subject to statutory licensing upon compliance with the requirements of subsection (d)
where the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary transmission is permissible under the
rules, regulations, or authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the willful or repeated
secondary transmission to the public by a cable system of a primary transmission made by a
broadcast station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission or by an appropriate
governmental authority of Canada or Mexico and embodying a performance or display of a work
is actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is fully subject to the remedies
provided by sections 502 through 506, in the following cases:
(A) where the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary transmission is not
permissible under the rules, regulations, or authorizations of the Federal Communications
Commission; or
(B) where the cable system has not deposited the statement of account and royalty fee
required by subsection (d).
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection and subject to the
provisions of subsection (e) of this section, the secondary transmission to the public by a cable
system of a performance or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission made by a
broadcast station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission or by an appropriate
governmental authority of Canada or Mexico is actionable as an act of infringement under section
501, and is fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506 and section 510, if
the content of the particular program in which the performance or display is embodied, or any
commercial advertising or station announcements transmitted by the primary transmitter during, or
immediately before or after, the transmission of such program, is in any way willfully altered by
the cable system through changes, deletions, or additions, except for the alteration, deletion, or
substitution of commercial advertisements performed by those engaged in television commercial
advertising market research: Provided, That the research company has obtained the prior consent
of the advertiser who has purchased the original commercial advertisement, the television station
broadcasting that commercial advertisement, and the cable system performing the secondary
transmission: And provided further, That such commercial alteration, deletion, or substitution is
not performed for the purpose of deriving income from the sale of that commercial time.
(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the secondary
transmission to the public by a cable system of a performance or display of a work embodied in a
primary transmission made by a broadcast station licensed by an appropriate governmental
authority of Canada or Mexico is actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is
fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506, if (A) with respect to
Canadian signals, the community of the cable system is located more than 150 miles from the
United States-Canadian border and is also located south of the forty-second parallel of latitude, or
(B) with respect to Mexican signals, the secondary transmission is made by a cable system which
received the primary transmission by means other than direct interception of a free space radio
wave emitted by such broadcast television station, unless prior to April 15, 1976, such cable
system was actually carrying, or was specifically authorized to carry, the signal of such foreign
station on the system pursuant to the rules, regulations, or authorizations of the Federal
Communications Commission.
(d) STATUTORY LICENSE FOR SECONDARY TRANSMISSIONS BY CABLE
SYSTEMS.—
(1) STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT AND ROYALTY FEES.—Subject to paragraph (5), a cable
system whose secondary transmissions have been subject to statutory licensing under subsection
(c) shall, on a semiannual basis, deposit with the Register of Copyrights, in accordance with
[Release Point 118-106]
requirements that the Register shall prescribe by regulation the following:
(A) A statement of account, covering the six months next preceding, specifying the number
of channels on which the cable system made secondary transmissions to its subscribers, the
names and locations of all primary transmitters whose transmissions were further transmitted by
the cable system, the total number of subscribers, the gross amounts paid to the cable system for
the basic service of providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters, and
such other data as the Register of Copyrights may from time to time prescribe by regulation. In
determining the total number of subscribers and the gross amounts paid to the cable system for
the basic service of providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters, the
system shall not include subscribers and amounts collected from subscribers receiving
secondary transmissions pursuant to section 119. Such statement shall also include a special
statement of account covering any non-network television programming that was carried by the
cable system in whole or in part beyond the local service area of the primary transmitter, under
rules, regulations, or authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission permitting the
substitution or addition of signals under certain circumstances, together with logs showing the
times, dates, stations, and programs involved in such substituted or added carriage.
(B) Except in the case of a cable system whose royalty fee is specified in subparagraph (E) or
(F), a total royalty fee payable to copyright owners pursuant to paragraph (3) for the period
covered by the statement, computed on the basis of specified percentages of the gross receipts
from subscribers to the cable service during such period for the basic service of providing
secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters, as follows:
(i) 1.064 percent of such gross receipts for the privilege of further transmitting, beyond the
local service area of such primary transmitter, any non-network programming of a primary
transmitter in whole or in part, such amount to be applied against the fee, if any, payable
pursuant to clauses (ii) through (iv);
(ii) 1.064 percent of such gross receipts for the first distant signal equivalent;
(iii) 0.701 percent of such gross receipts for each of the second, third, and fourth distant
signal equivalents; and
(iv) 0.330 percent of such gross receipts for the fifth distant signal equivalent and each
distant signal equivalent thereafter.
(C) In computing amounts under clauses (ii) through (iv) of subparagraph (B)—
(i) any fraction of a distant signal equivalent shall be computed at its fractional value;
(ii) in the case of any cable system located partly within and partly outside of the local
service area of a primary transmitter, gross receipts shall be limited to those gross receipts
derived from subscribers located outside of the local service area of such primary transmitter;
and
(iii) if a cable system provides a secondary transmission of a primary transmitter to some
but not all communities served by that cable system—
(I) the gross receipts and the distant signal equivalent values for such secondary
transmission shall be derived solely on the basis of the subscribers in those communities
where the cable system provides such secondary transmission; and
(II) the total royalty fee for the period paid by such system shall not be less than the
royalty fee calculated under subparagraph (B)(i) multiplied by the gross receipts from all
subscribers to the system.
(D) A cable system that, on a statement submitted before the date of the enactment of the
Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, computed its royalty fee consistent
with the methodology under subparagraph (C)(iii), or that amends a statement filed before such
date of enactment to compute the royalty fee due using such methodology, shall not be subject
to an action for infringement, or eligible for any royalty refund or offset, arising out of its use of
such methodology on such statement.
(E) If the actual gross receipts paid by subscribers to a cable system for the period covered by
[Release Point 118-106]
the statement for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast
transmitters are $263,800 or less—
(i) gross receipts of the cable system for the purpose of this paragraph shall be computed
by subtracting from such actual gross receipts the amount by which $263,800 exceeds such
actual gross receipts, except that in no case shall a cable system's gross receipts be reduced to
less than $10,400; and
(ii) the royalty fee payable under this paragraph to copyright owners pursuant to paragraph
(3) shall be 0.5 percent, regardless of the number of distant signal equivalents, if any.
(F) If the actual gross receipts paid by subscribers to a cable system for the period covered by
the statement for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast
transmitters are more than $263,800 but less than $527,600, the royalty fee payable under this
paragraph to copyright owners pursuant to paragraph (3) shall be—
(i) 0.5 percent of any gross receipts up to $263,800, regardless of the number of distant
signal equivalents, if any; and
(ii) 1 percent of any gross receipts in excess of $263,800, but less than $527,600,
regardless of the number of distant signal equivalents, if any.
(G) A filing fee, as determined by the Register of Copyrights pursuant to section 708(a).
(2) HANDLING OF FEES.—The Register of Copyrights shall receive all fees (including the
filing fee specified in paragraph (1)(G)) deposited under this section and, after deducting the
reasonable costs incurred by the Copyright Office under this section, shall deposit the balance in
the Treasury of the United States, in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury directs. All
funds held by the Secretary of the Treasury shall be invested in interest-bearing United States
securities for later distribution with interest by the Librarian of Congress upon authorization by the
Copyright Royalty Judges.
(3) DISTRIBUTION OF ROYALTY FEES TO COPYRIGHT OWNERS.—The royalty fees
thus deposited shall, in accordance with the procedures provided by paragraph (4), be distributed
to those among the following copyright owners who claim that their works were the subject of
secondary transmissions by cable systems during the relevant semiannual period:
(A) Any such owner whose work was included in a secondary transmission made by a cable
system of a non-network television program in whole or in part beyond the local service area of
the primary transmitter.
(B) Any such owner whose work was included in a secondary transmission identified in a
special statement of account deposited under paragraph (1)(A).
(C) Any such owner whose work was included in non-network programming consisting
exclusively of aural signals carried by a cable system in whole or in part beyond the local
service area of the primary transmitter of such programs.
(4) PROCEDURES FOR ROYALTY FEE DISTRIBUTION.—The royalty fees thus deposited
shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures:
(A) During the month of July in each year, every person claiming to be entitled to statutory
license fees for secondary transmissions shall file a claim with the Copyright Royalty Judges, in
accordance with requirements that the Copyright Royalty Judges shall prescribe by regulation.
Notwithstanding any provisions of the antitrust laws, for purposes of this clause any claimants
may agree among themselves as to the proportionate division of statutory licensing fees among
them, may lump their claims together and file them jointly or as a single claim, or may
designate a common agent to receive payment on their behalf.
(B) After the first day of August of each year, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall determine
whether there exists a controversy concerning the distribution of royalty fees. If the Copyright
Royalty Judges determine that no such controversy exists, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall
authorize the Librarian of Congress to proceed to distribute such fees to the copyright owners
[Release Point 118-106]
entitled to receive them, or to their designated agents, subject to the deduction of reasonable
administrative costs under this section. If the Copyright Royalty Judges find the existence of a
controversy, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall, pursuant to chapter 8 of this title, conduct a
proceeding to determine the distribution of royalty fees.
(C) During the pendency of any proceeding under this subsection, the Copyright Royalty
Judges shall have the discretion to authorize the Librarian of Congress to proceed to distribute
any amounts that are not in controversy.
(5) 3.75 PERCENT RATE AND SYNDICATED EXCLUSIVITY SURCHARGE NOT
APPLICABLE TO MULTICAST STREAMS.—The royalty rates specified in sections 256.2(c)
and 256.2(d) of title 37, Code of Federal Regulations (commonly referred to as the "3.75 percent
rate" and the "syndicated exclusivity surcharge", respectively), as in effect on the date of the
enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, as such rates may be
adjusted, or such sections redesignated, thereafter by the Copyright Royalty Judges, shall not
apply to the secondary transmission of a multicast stream.
(6) VERIFICATION OF ACCOUNTS AND FEE PAYMENTS.—The Register of Copyrights
shall issue regulations to provide for the confidential verification by copyright owners whose
works were embodied in the secondary transmissions of primary transmissions pursuant to this
section of the information reported on the semiannual statements of account filed under this
subsection for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2010, in order that the auditor
designated under subparagraph (A) is able to confirm the correctness of the calculations and
royalty payments reported therein. The regulations shall—
(A) establish procedures for the designation of a qualified independent auditor—
(i) with exclusive authority to request verification of such a statement of account on behalf
of all copyright owners whose works were the subject of secondary transmissions of primary
transmissions by the cable system (that deposited the statement) during the accounting period
covered by the statement; and
(ii) who is not an officer, employee, or agent of any such copyright owner for any purpose
other than such audit;
(B) establish procedures for safeguarding all non-public financial and business information
provided under this paragraph;
(C)(i) require a consultation period for the independent auditor to review its conclusions with
a designee of the cable system;
(ii) establish a mechanism for the cable system to remedy any errors identified in the auditor's
report and to cure any underpayment identified; and
(iii) provide an opportunity to remedy any disputed facts or conclusions;
(D) limit the frequency of requests for verification for a particular cable system and the
number of audits that a multiple system operator can be required to undergo in a single year;
and
(E) permit requests for verification of a statement of account to be made only within 3 years
after the last day of the year in which the statement of account is filed.
(7) ACCEPTANCE OF ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS.—Any royalty fee payments received by
the Copyright Office from cable systems for the secondary transmission of primary transmissions
that are in addition to the payments calculated and deposited in accordance with this subsection
shall be deemed to have been deposited for the particular accounting period for which they are
received and shall be distributed as specified under this subsection.
(e) NONSIMULTANEOUS SECONDARY TRANSMISSIONS BY CABLE SYSTEMS.—
(1) Notwithstanding those provisions of the 1 subsection (f)(2) relating to nonsimultaneous
secondary transmissions by a cable system, any such transmissions are actionable as an act of
infringement under section 501, and are fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502
[Release Point 118-106]
through 506 and section 510, unless—
(A) the program on the videotape is transmitted no more than one time to the cable system's
subscribers;
(B) the copyrighted program, episode, or motion picture videotape, including the
commercials contained within such program, episode, or picture, is transmitted without deletion
or editing;
(C) an owner or officer of the cable system (i) prevents the duplication of the videotape while
in the possession of the system, (ii) prevents unauthorized duplication while in the possession of
the facility making the videotape for the system if the system owns or controls the facility, or
takes reasonable precautions to prevent such duplication if it does not own or control the
facility, (iii) takes adequate precautions to prevent duplication while the tape is being
transported, and (iv) subject to paragraph (2), erases or destroys, or causes the erasure or
destruction of, the videotape;
(D) within forty-five days after the end of each calendar quarter, an owner or officer of the
cable system executes an affidavit attesting (i) to the steps and precautions taken to prevent
duplication of the videotape, and (ii) subject to paragraph (2), to the erasure or destruction of all
videotapes made or used during such quarter;
(E) such owner or officer places or causes each such affidavit, and affidavits received
pursuant to paragraph (2)(C), to be placed in a file, open to public inspection, at such system's
main office in the community where the transmission is made or in the nearest community
where such system maintains an office; and
(F) the nonsimultaneous transmission is one that the cable system would be authorized to
transmit under the rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Federal Communications
Commission in effect at the time of the nonsimultaneous transmission if the transmission had
been made simultaneously, except that this subparagraph shall not apply to inadvertent or
accidental transmissions.
(2) If a cable system transfers to any person a videotape of a program nonsimultaneously
transmitted by it, such transfer is actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is
fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506, except that, pursuant to a
written, nonprofit contract providing for the equitable sharing of the costs of such videotape and
its transfer, a videotape nonsimultaneously transmitted by it, in accordance with paragraph (1),
may be transferred by one cable system in Alaska to another system in Alaska, by one cable
system in Hawaii permitted to make such nonsimultaneous transmissions to another such cable
system in Hawaii, or by one cable system in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated
States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, or the Republic of the Marshall Islands, to another
cable system in any of those five entities, if—
(A) each such contract is available for public inspection in the offices of the cable systems
involved, and a copy of such contract is filed, within thirty days after such contract is entered
into, with the Copyright Office (which Office shall make each such contract available for public
inspection);
(B) the cable system to which the videotape is transferred complies with paragraph (1)(A),
(B), (C)(i), (iii), and (iv), and (D) through (F); and
(C) such system provides a copy of the affidavit required to be made in accordance with
paragraph (1)(D) to each cable system making a previous nonsimultaneous transmission of the
same videotape.
(3) This subsection shall not be construed to supersede the exclusivity protection provisions of
any existing agreement, or any such agreement hereafter entered into, between a cable system and
a television broadcast station in the area in which the cable system is located, or a network with
which such station is affiliated.
(4) As used in this subsection, the term "videotape" means the reproduction of the images and
sounds of a program or programs broadcast by a television broadcast station licensed by the
[Release Point 118-106]
Federal Communications Commission, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as
tapes or films, in which the reproduction is embodied.
(f) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the following terms mean the following:
(1) PRIMARY TRANSMISSION.—A "primary transmission" is a transmission made to the
public by a transmitting facility whose signals are being received and further transmitted by a
secondary transmission service, regardless of where or when the performance or display was first
transmitted. In the case of a television broadcast station, the primary stream and any multicast
streams transmitted by the station constitute primary transmissions.
(2) SECONDARY TRANSMISSION.—A "secondary transmission" is the further transmitting
of a primary transmission simultaneously with the primary transmission, or nonsimultaneously
with the primary transmission if by a cable system not located in whole or in part within the
boundary of the forty-eight contiguous States, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico: Provided, however, That a
nonsimultaneous further transmission by a cable system located in Hawaii of a primary
transmission shall be deemed to be a secondary transmission if the carriage of the television
broadcast signal comprising such further transmission is permissible under the rules, regulations,
or authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission.
(3) CABLE SYSTEM.—A "cable system" is a facility, located in any State, territory, trust
territory, or possession of the United States, that in whole or in part receives signals transmitted or
programs broadcast by one or more television broadcast stations licensed by the Federal
Communications Commission, and makes secondary transmissions of such signals or programs by
wires, cables, microwave, or other communications channels to subscribing members of the public
who pay for such service. For purposes of determining the royalty fee under subsection (d)(1), two
or more cable systems in contiguous communities under common ownership or control or
operating from one headend shall be considered as one system.
(4) LOCAL SERVICE AREA OF A PRIMARY TRANSMITTER.—The "local service area of
a primary transmitter", in the case of both the primary stream and any multicast streams
transmitted by a primary transmitter that is a television broadcast station, comprises the area where
such primary transmitter could have insisted upon its signal being retransmitted by a cable system
pursuant to the rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission
in effect on April 15, 1976, or such station's television market as defined in section 76.55(e) of
title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on September 18, 1993), or any modifications to
such television market made, on or after September 18, 1993, pursuant to section 76.55(e) or 76.59
of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or within the noise-limited contour as defined in
73.622(e)(1) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or in the case of a television broadcast
station licensed by an appropriate governmental authority of Canada or Mexico, the area in which
it would be entitled to insist upon its signal being retransmitted if it were a television broadcast
station subject to such rules, regulations, and authorizations. In the case of a low power television
station, as defined by the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, the
"local service area of a primary transmitter" comprises the designated market area, as defined in
section 122(j)(2)(C), that encompasses the community of license of such station and any
community that is located outside such designated market area that is either wholly or partially
within 35 miles of the transmitter site or, in the case of such a station located in a standard
metropolitan statistical area which has one of the 50 largest populations of all standard
metropolitan statistical areas (based on the 1980 decennial census of population taken by the
Secretary of Commerce), wholly or partially within 20 miles of such transmitter site. The "local
service area of a primary transmitter", in the case of a radio broadcast station, comprises the
primary service area of such station, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission.
(5) DISTANT SIGNAL EQUIVALENT.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided under subparagraph (B), a "distant signal
equivalent"—
(i) is the value assigned to the secondary transmission of any non-network television
[Release Point 118-106]
programming carried by a cable system in whole or in part beyond the local service area of
the primary transmitter of such programming; and
(ii) is computed by assigning a value of one to each primary stream and to each multicast
stream (other than a simulcast) that is an independent station, and by assigning a value of
one-quarter to each primary stream and to each multicast stream (other than a simulcast) that
is a network station or a noncommercial educational station.
(B) EXCEPTIONS.—The values for independent, network, and noncommercial educational
stations specified in subparagraph (A) are subject to the following:
(i) Where the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission require a
cable system to omit the further transmission of a particular program and such rules and
regulations also permit the substitution of another program embodying a performance or
display of a work in place of the omitted transmission, or where such rules and regulations in
effect on the date of the enactment of the Copyright Act of 1976 2 permit a cable system, at
its election, to effect such omission and substitution of a nonlive program or to carry
additional programs not transmitted by primary transmitters within whose local service area
the cable system is located, no value shall be assigned for the substituted or additional
program.
(ii) Where the rules, regulations, or authorizations of the Federal Communications
Commission in effect on the date of the enactment of the Copyright Act of 1976 2 permit a
cable system, at its election, to omit the further transmission of a particular program and such
rules, regulations, or authorizations also permit the substitution of another program
embodying a performance or display of a work in place of the omitted transmission, the value
assigned for the substituted or additional program shall be, in the case of a live program, the
value of one full distant signal equivalent multiplied by a fraction that has as its numerator
the number of days in the year in which such substitution occurs and as its denominator the
number of days in the year.
(iii) In the case of the secondary transmission of a primary transmitter that is a television
broadcast station pursuant to the late-night or specialty programming rules of the Federal
Communications Commission, or the secondary transmission of a primary transmitter that is
a television broadcast station on a part-time basis where full-time carriage is not possible
because the cable system lacks the activated channel capacity to retransmit on a full-time
basis all signals that it is authorized to carry, the values for independent, network, and
noncommercial educational stations set forth in subparagraph (A), as the case may be, shall
be multiplied by a fraction that is equal to the ratio of the broadcast hours of such primary
transmitter retransmitted by the cable system to the total broadcast hours of the primary
transmitter.
(iv) No value shall be assigned for the secondary transmission of the primary stream or any
multicast streams of a primary transmitter that is a television broadcast station in any
community that is within the local service area of the primary transmitter.
(6) NETWORK STATION.—
(A) TREATMENT OF PRIMARY STREAM.—The term "network station" shall be applied
to a primary stream of a television broadcast station that is owned or operated by, or affiliated
with, one or more of the television networks in the United States providing nationwide
transmissions, and that transmits a substantial part of the programming supplied by such
networks for a substantial part of the primary stream's typical broadcast day.
(B) TREATMENT OF MULTICAST STREAMS.—The term "network station" shall be
applied to a multicast stream on which a television broadcast station transmits all or
substantially all of the programming of an interconnected program service that—
(i) is owned or operated by, or affiliated with, one or more of the television networks
described in subparagraph (A); and
(ii) offers programming on a regular basis for 15 or more hours per week to at least 25 of
[Release Point 118-106]
the affiliated television licensees of the interconnected program service in 10 or more States.
(7) INDEPENDENT STATION.—The term "independent station" shall be applied to the
primary stream or a multicast stream of a television broadcast station that is not a network station
or a noncommercial educational station.
(8) NONCOMMERCIAL EDUCATIONAL STATION.—The term "noncommercial
educational station" shall be applied to the primary stream or a multicast stream of a television
broadcast station that is a noncommercial educational broadcast station as defined in section 397
of the Communications Act of 1934, as in effect on the date of the enactment of the Satellite
Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010.
(9) PRIMARY STREAM.—A "primary stream" is—
(A) the single digital stream of programming that, before June 12, 2009, was substantially
duplicating the programming transmitted by the television broadcast station as an analog signal;
or
(B) if there is no stream described in subparagraph (A), then the single digital stream of
programming transmitted by the television broadcast station for the longest period of time.
(10) PRIMARY TRANSMITTER.—A "primary transmitter" is a television or radio broadcast
station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, or by an appropriate governmental
authority of Canada or Mexico, that makes primary transmissions to the public.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Introduction and General Summary. The complex and economically important problem of "secondary
transmissions" is considered in section 111. For the most part, the section is directed at the operation of cable
television systems and the terms and conditions of their liability for the retransmission of copyrighted works.
However, other forms of secondary transmissions are also considered, including apartment house and hotel
systems, wired instructional systems, common carriers, nonprofit "boosters" and translators, and secondary
transmissions of primary transmissions to controlled groups.
Cable television systems are commercial subscription services that pick up broadcasts of programs
originated by others and retransmit them to paying subscribers. A typical system consists of a central antenna
which receives and amplifies television signals and a network of cables through which the signals are
transmitted to the receiving sets of individual subscribers. In addition to an installation charge, the subscribers
[Release Point 118-106]
pay a monthly charge for the basic service averaging about six dollars. A large number of these systems
provide automated programing. A growing number of CATV systems also originate programs, such as movies
and sports, and charge additional fees for this service (pay-cable).
The number of cable systems has grown very rapidly since their introduction in 1950, and now total about
3,450 operating systems, servicing 7,700 communities. Systems currently in operation reach about 10.8
million homes. It is reported that the 1975 total subscriber revenues of the cable industry were approximately
$770 million.
Pursuant to two decisions of the Supreme Court (Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artist Television, Inc., 392
U.S. 390 (1968) [88 S.Ct. 2084, 20 L.Ed.2d 1176, rehearing denied 89 S.Ct. 65, 393 U.S. 902, 21 L.Ed.2d
190], and Teleprompter Corp. v. CBS, Inc., 415 U.S. 394 (1974)) [94 S.Ct. 1129, 39 L.Ed.2d 415], under the
1909 copyright law, the cable television industry has not been paying copyright royalties for its retransmission
of over-the-air broadcast signals. Both decisions urged the Congress, however, to consider and determine the
scope and extent of such liability in the pending revision bill.
The difficult problem of determining the copyright liability of cable television systems has been before the
Congress since 1965. In 1967, this Committee sought to address and resolve the issues in H.R. 2512, an early
version of the general revision bill (see H.R. Rep. No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st Sess.). However, largely because of
the cable-copyright impasse, the bill died in the Senate.
The history of the attempts to find a solution to the problem since 1967 has been explored thoroughly in the
voluminous hearings and testimony on the general revision bill, and has also been succinctly summarized by
the Register of Copyrights in her Second Supplementary Report, Chapter V.
The Committee now has before it the Senate bill which contains a series of detailed and complex provisions
which attempt to resolve the question of the copyright liability of cable television systems. After extensive
consideration of the Senate bill, the arguments made during and after the hearings, and of the issues involved,
this Committee has also concluded that there is no simple answer to the cable-copyright controversy. In
particular, any statutory scheme that imposes copyright liability on cable television systems must take account
of the intricate and complicated rules and regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission to
govern the cable television industry. While the Committee has carefully avoided including in the bill any
provisions which would interfere with the FCC's rules or which might be characterized as affecting
"communications policy", the Committee has been cognizant of the interplay between the copyright and the
communications elements of the legislation.
We would, therefore, caution the Federal Communications Commission, and others who make
determinations concerning communications policy, not to rely upon any action of this Committee as a basis
for any significant changes in the delicate balance of regulation in areas where the Congress has not resolved
the issue. Specifically, we would urge the Federal Communications Commission to understand that it was not
the intent of this bill to touch on issues such as pay cable regulation or increased use of imported distant
signals. These matters are ones of communications policy and should be left to the appropriate committees in
the Congress for resolution.
In general, the Committee believes that cable systems are commercial enterprises whose basic
retransmission operations are based on the carriage of copyrighted program material and that copyright
royalties should be paid by cable operators to the creators of such programs. The Committee recognizes,
however, that it would be impractical and unduly burdensome to require every cable system to negotiate with
every copyright owner whose work was retransmitted by a cable system. Accordingly, the Committee has
determined to maintain the basic principle of the Senate bill to establish a compulsory copyright license for
the retransmission of those over-the-air broadcast signals that a cable system is authorized to carry pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the FCC.
The compulsory license is conditioned, however, on certain requirements and limitations. These include
compliance with reporting requirements, payment of the royalty fees established in the bill, a ban on the
substitution or deletion of commercial advertising, and geographic limits on the compulsory license for
copyrighted programs broadcast by Canadian or Mexican stations. Failure to comply with these requirements
and limitations subjects a cable system to a suit for copyright infringement and the remedies provided under
the bill for such actions.
In setting a royalty fee schedule for the compulsory license, the Committee determined that the initial
schedule should be established in the bill. It recognized, however, that adjustments to the schedule would be
required from time to time. Accordingly, the Copyright Royalty Commission, established in chapter 8 [§801 et
seq. of this title], is empowered to make the adjustments in the initial rates, at specified times, based on
standards and conditions set forth in the bill.
In setting an initial fee schedule, the Senate bill based the royalty fee on a sliding scale related to the gross
receipts of a cable system for providing the basic retransmission service and rejected a statutory scheme that
[Release Point 118-106]
would distinguish between "local" and "distant" signals. The Committee determined, however, that there was
no evidence that the retransmission of "local" broadcast signals by a cable operator threatens the existing
market for copyright program owners. Similarly, the retransmission of network programing, including
network programing which is broadcast in "distant" markets, does not injure the copyright owner. The
copyright owner contracts with the network on the basis of his programing reaching all markets served by the
network and is compensated accordingly.
By contrast, their retransmission of distant non-network programing by cable systems causes damage to the
copyright owner by distributing the program in an area beyond which it has been licensed. Such
retransmission adversely affects the ability of the copyright owner to exploit the work in the distant market. It
is also of direct benefit to the cable system by enhancing its ability to attract subscribers and increase
revenues. For these reasons, the Committee has concluded that the copyright liability of cable television
systems under the compulsory license should be limited to the retransmission of distant non-network
programing.
In implementing this conclusion, the Committee generally followed a proposal submitted by the cable and
motion picture industries, the two industries most directly affected by the establishment of copyright royalties
for cable television systems. Under the proposal, the royalty fee is determined by a two step computation.
First, a value called a "distant signal equivalent" is assigned to all "distant" signals. Distant signals are defined
as signals retransmitted by a cable system, in whole or in part, outside the local service area of the primary
transmitter. Different values are assigned to independent, network, and educational stations because of the
different amounts of viewing of non-network programing carried by such stations. For example, the viewing
of non-network programs on network stations is considered to approximate 25 percent. These values are then
combined and a scale of percentages is applied to the cumulative total.
The Committee also considered various proposals to exempt certain categories of cable systems from
royalty payments altogether. The Committee determined that the approach of the Senate bill to require some
payment by every cable system is sound, but established separate fee schedules for cable systems whose gross
receipts for the basic retransmission service do not exceed either $80,000 or $160,000 semiannually. It is the
Committee's view that the fee schedules adopted for these systems are now appropriate, based on their relative
size and the services performed.
All the royalty payments required under the bill are paid on a semiannual basis to the Register of
Copyrights. Each year they are distributed by the Copyright Royalty Commission to those copyright owners
who may validly claim that their works were the subject of distant non-network retransmissions by cable
systems.
Based on current estimates supplied to the Committee, the total royalty fees paid under the initial schedule
established in the bill should approximate $8.7 million. Compared with the present number of cable television
subscribers, calculated at 10.8 million, copyright payments under the bill would therefore approximate 81
cents per subscriber per year. The Committee believes that such payments are modest and will not retard the
orderly development of the cable television industry or the service it provides to its subscribers.
Analysis of Provisions. Throughout section 111, the operative terms are "primary transmission" and
"secondary transmission." These terms are defined in subsection (f) entirely in relation to each other. In any
particular case, the "primary" transmitter is the one whose signals are being picked up and further transmitted
by a "secondary" transmitter which in turn, is someone engaged in "the further transmitting of a primary
transmission simultaneously with the primary transmission." With one exception provided in subsection (f)
and limited by subsection (e), the section does not cover or permit a cable system, or indeed any person, to
tape or otherwise record a program off-the-air and later to transmit the program from the tape or record to the
public. The one exception involves cable systems located outside the continental United States, but not
including cable systems in Puerto Rico, or, with limited exceptions, Hawaii. These systems are permitted to
record and retransmit programs under the compulsory license, subject to the restrictive conditions of
subsection (e), because off-the-air signals are generally not available in the offshore areas.
General Exemptions. Certain secondary transmissions are given a general exemption under clause (1) of
section 111(a). The first of these applies to secondary transmissions consisting "entirely of the relaying, by the
management of a hotel, apartment house, or similar establishment" of a transmission to the private lodgings of
guests or residents and provided "no direct charge is made to see or hear the secondary transmission."
The exemption would not apply if the secondary transmission consists of anything other than the mere relay
of ordinary broadcasts. The cutting out of advertising, the running in of new commercials, or any other change
in the signal relayed would subject the secondary transmitter to full liability. Moreover, the term "private
lodgings" is limited to rooms used as living quarters or for private parties, and does not include dining rooms,
[Release Point 118-106]
meeting halls, theatres, ballrooms, or similar places that are outside of a normal circle of a family and its
social acquaintances. No special exception is needed to make clear that the mere placing of an ordinary radio
or television set in a private hotel room does not constitute an infringement.
Secondary Transmissions of Instructional Broadcasts. Clause (2) of section 111(a) is intended to make
clear that an instructional transmission within the scope of section 110(2) is exempt whether it is a "primary
transmission" or a "secondary transmission."
Carriers. The general exemption under section 111 extends to secondary transmitters that act solely as
passive carriers. Under clause (3), a carrier is exempt if it "has no direct or indirect control over the content or
selection of the primary transmission or over the particular recipients of the secondary transmission." For this
purpose its activities must "consist solely of providing wires, cables, or other communications channels for the
use of others."
Clause (4) would exempt the activities of secondary transmitters that operate on a completely nonprofit
basis. The operations of nonprofit "translators" or "boosters," which do nothing more than amplify broadcast
signals and retransmit them to everyone in an area for free reception, would be exempt if there is no "purpose
of direct or indirect commercial advantage," and if there is no charge to the recipients "other than assessments
necessary to defray the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the secondary transmission
service." This exemption does not apply to a cable television system.
Secondary Transmissions of Primary Transmissions to Controlled Group. Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsections (a) and (c), the secondary transmission to the public of a primary transmission
embodying a performance or display is actionable as an act of infringement if the primary transmission is not
made for reception by the public at large but is controlled and limited to reception by particular members of
the public. Examples of transmissions not intended for the general public are background music services such
as MUZAK, closed circuit broadcasts to theatres, pay television (STV) or pay-cable.
The Senate bill contains a provision, however, stating that the secondary transmission does not constitute an
act of infringement if the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary transmission is required under the
rules and regulations of the FCC. The exclusive purpose of this provision is to exempt a cable system from
copyright liability if the FCC should require cable systems to carry to their subscribers a "scrambled" pay
signal of a subscription television station.
The Committee is concerned, however, that the Senate bill is not clearly limited to the situation where a
cable system is required by the FCC to carry a "scrambled" pay television signal. The Committee believes that
the provision should not include any authority or permission to "unscramble" the signal. Further, the Senate
bill does not make clear that the exception would not apply if the primary transmission is made by a cable
system or cable system network transmitting its own originated program, e.g., pay-cable. For these reasons,
the subsection was amended to provide that the exception would only apply if (1) the primary transmission to
a controlled group is made by a broadcast station licensed by the FCC; (2) the carriage of the signal is required
by FCC rules and regulations; and (3) the signal of the primary transmitter is not altered or changed in any
way by the secondary transmitter.
Compulsory License. Section 111(c) establishes the compulsory license for cable systems generally. It
provides that, subject to the provisions of clauses (2), (3) and (4), the secondary transmission to the public by
a cable system of a primary transmission made by a broadcast station licensed by the FCC or by an
appropriate governmental authority of Canada or Mexico is subject to compulsory licensing upon compliance
with the provisions of subsection (d) where the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary transmission
is permissible under the rules and regulations of the FCC. The compulsory license applies, therefore, to the
carriage of over-the-air broadcast signals and is inapplicable to the secondary transmission of any
nonbroadcast primary transmission such as a program originated by a cable system or a cable network. The
latter would be subject to full copyright liability under other sections of the legislation.
Limitations on the Compulsory License. Sections 111(c)(2), (3) and (4) establish limitations on the scope
of the compulsory license, and provide that failure to comply with these limitations subjects a cable system to
a suit for infringement and all the remedies provided in the legislation for such actions.
Section 111(c)(2) provides that the "willful or repeated" carriage of signals not permissible under the rules
and regulations of the FCC subjects a cable system to full copyright liability. The words "willful or repeated"
are used to prevent a cable system from being subjected to severe penalties for innocent or casual acts
("Repeated" does not mean merely "more than once," of course; rather, it denotes a degree of aggravated
negligence which borders on willfulness. Such a condition would not exist in the case of an innocent mistake
as to what signals or programs may properly be carried under the FCC's complicated rules). Section 111(c)(2)
also provides that a cable system is subject to full copyright liability where the cable system has not recorded
the notice, deposited the statement of account, or paid the royalty fee required by subsection (d). The
Committee does not intend, however, that a good faith error by the cable system in computing the amount due
[Release Point 118-106]
would subject it to full liability as an infringer. The Committee expects that in most instances of this type the
parties would be able to work out the problem without resort to the courts.
Commercial Substitution. Section 111(c)(3) provides that a cable system is fully subject to the remedies
provided in this legislation for copyright infringement if the cable system willfully alters, through changes,
deletions, or additions, the content of a particular program or any commercial advertising or station
announcements transmitted by the primary transmitter during, or immediately before or after, the transmission
of the program. In the Committee's view, any willful deletion, substitution, or insertion of commercial
advertisements of any nature by a cable system or changes in the program content of the primary transmission,
significantly alters the basic nature of the cable retransmission service, and makes its function similar to that
of a broadcaster. Further, the placement of substitute advertising in a program by a cable system on a "local"
signal harms the advertiser and, in turn, the copyright owner, whose compensation for the work is directly
related to the size of the audience that the advertiser's message is calculated to reach. On a "distant" signal, the
placement of substitute advertising harms the local broadcaster in the distant market because the cable system
is then competing for local advertising dollars without having comparable program costs. The Committee has
therefore attempted broadly to proscribe the availability of the compulsory license if a cable system substitutes
commercial messages. Included in the prohibition are commercial messages and station announcements not
only during, but also immediately before or after the program, so as to insure a continuous ban on commercial
substitution from one program to another. In one situation, however, the Committee has permitted such
substitution when the commercials are inserted by those engaged in television commercial advertising market
research. This exception is limited to those situations where the research company has obtained the consent of
the advertiser who purchased the original commercial advertisement, the television station whose signal is
retransmitted, and the cable system, and provided further that no income is derived from the sale of such
commercial time.
Canadian and Mexican Signals. Section 111(c)(4) provides limitations on the compulsory license with
respect to foreign signals carried by cable systems from Canada or Mexico. Under the Senate bill, the carriage
of any foreign signals by a cable system would have been subject to full copyright liability, because the
compulsory license was limited to the retransmission of broadcast stations licensed by the FCC. The
Committee recognized, however, that cable systems primarily along the northern and southern border have
received authorization from the FCC to carry broadcast signals of certain Canadian and Mexican stations.
In the Committee's view, the authorization by the FCC to a cable system to carry a foreign signal does not
resolve the copyright question of the royalty payment that should be made for copyrighted programs
originating in the foreign country. The latter raises important international questions of the protection to be
accorded foreign copyrighted works in the United States. While the Committee has established a general
compulsory licensing scheme for the retransmission of copyrighted works of U.S. nationals, a broad
compulsory license scheme for all foreign works does not appear warranted or justified. Thus, for example, if
in the future the signal of a British, French, or Japanese station were retransmitted in the United States by a
cable system, full copyright liability would apply.
With respect to Canadian and Mexican signals, the Committee found that a special situation exists
regarding the carriage of these signals by U.S. cable systems on the northern and southern borders,
respectively. The Committee determined, therefore, that with respect to Canadian signals the compulsory
license would apply in an area located 150 miles from the U.S.-Canadian border, or south from the border to
the 42nd parallel of latitude, whichever distance is greater. Thus the cities of Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland,
Green Bay and Seattle would be included within the compulsory license area, while cities such as New York,
Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco would be located outside the area.
With respect to Mexican signals, the Commission determined that the compulsory license would apply only
in the area in which such signals may be received by a U.S. cable system by means of direct interception of a
free space radio wave. Thus, full copyright liability would apply if a cable system were required to use any
equipment or device other than a receiving antenna to bring the signal to the community of the cable system.
Further, to take account of those cable systems that are presently carrying or are specifically authorized to
carry Canadian or Mexican signals, pursuant to FCC rules and regulations, and whether or not within the
zones established, the Committee determined to grant a compulsory license for the carriage of those specific
signals on those cable systems as in effect on April 15, 1976.
The Committee wishes to stress that cable systems operating within these zones are fully subject to the
payment of royalty fees under the compulsory license for those foreign signals retransmitted. The copyright
owners of the works transmitted may appear before the Copyright Royalty Commission and, pursuant to the
provisions of this legislation, file claims to their fair share of the royalties collected. Outside the zones,
however, full copyright liability would apply as would all the remedies of the legislation for any act of
infringement.
[Release Point 118-106]
Requirements for a Compulsory License. The compulsory license provided for in section 111(c) is
contingent upon fulfillment of the requirements set forth in section 111(d). Subsection (d)(1) directs that at
least one month before the commencement of operations, or within 180 days after the enactment of this act
[Oct. 19, 1976], whichever is later, a cable system must record in the Copyright Office a notice, including a
statement giving the identity and address of the person who owns or operates the secondary transmission
service or who has power to exercise primary control over it, together with the name and location of the
primary transmitter whose signals are regularly carried by the cable system. Signals "regularly carried" by the
system mean those signals which the Federal Communications Commission has specifically authorized the
cable system to carry, and which are actually carried by the system on a regular basis. It is also required that
whenever the ownership or control or regular signal carriage complement of the system changes, the cable
system must within 30 days record any such changes in the Copyright Office. Cable systems must also record
such further information as the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
Subsection (d)(2) directs cable systems whose secondary transmissions have been subject to compulsory
licensing under subsection (c) to deposit with the Register of Copyrights a semi-annual statement of account.
The dates for filing such statements of account and the six-month period which they are to cover are to be
determined by the Register of Copyrights after consultation with the Copyright Royalty Commission. In
addition to other such information that the Register may prescribe by regulation, the statements of account are
to specify the number of channels on which the cable system made secondary transmissions to its subscribers,
the names and locations of all primary transmitters whose transmissions were carried by the system, the total
number of subscribers to the system, and the gross amounts paid to the system for the basic service of
providing secondary transmissions. If any non-network television programming was retransmitted by the
cable system beyond the local service area of the primary transmitter, pursuant to the rules of the Federal
Communications Commission, which under certain circumstances permit the substitution or addition of
television signals not regularly carried, the cable system must deposit a special statement of account listing the
times, dates, stations and programs involved in such substituted or added carriage.
Copyright Royalty Payments. Subsection (d)(2)(B), (C) and (D) require cable systems to deposit royalty
fee payments for the period covered by the statements of account. These payments are to be computed on the
basis of specified percentages of the gross receipts from cable subscribers during the period covered by the
statement. For purposes of computing royalty payments, only receipts for the basic service of providing
secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters are to be considered. Other receipts from
subscribers, such as those for pay-cable services or installation charges, are not included in gross receipts.
Subsection (d)(2)(B) provides that, except in the case of a cable system that comes within the gross receipts
limitations of subclauses (C) and (D), the royalty fee is computed in the following manner:
Every cable system pays .675 of 1 percent of its gross receipts for the privilege of retransmitting distant
non-network programming, such amount to be applied against the fee, if any, payable under the computation
for "distant signal equivalents." The latter are determined by adding together the values assigned to the actual
number of distant television stations carried by a cable system. The purpose of this initial rate, applicable to all
cable systems in this class, is to establish a basic payment, whether or not a particular cable system elects to
transmit distant non-network programming. It is not a payment for the retransmission of purely "local" signals,
as is evident from the provision that it applies to and is deductible from the fee payable for any "distant signal
equivalents."
The remaining provisions of subclause (B) establish the following rates for "distant signal equivalents:"
The rate from zero to one distant signal equivalent is .675 of 1 percent of gross subscriber revenues. An
additional .425 of 1 percent of gross subscriber revenues is to be paid for each of the second, third and fourth
distant signal equivalents that are carried. A further payment of .2 of 1 percent of gross subscriber revenues is
to be made for each distant signal equivalent after the fourth. Any fraction of a distant signal equivalent is to
be computed at its fractional value and where a cable system is located partly within and partly without the
local service area of a primary transmitter, the gross receipts subject to the percentage payment are limited to
those gross receipts derived from subscribers located without the local service area of such primary
transmitter.
Pursuant to the foregoing formula, copyright payments as a percentage of gross receipts increase as the
number of distant television signals carried by a cable system increases. Because many smaller cable systems
carry a large number of distant signals, especially those located in areas where over-the-air television service
is sparse, and because smaller cable systems may be less able to shoulder the burden of copyright payments
than larger systems, the Committee decided to give special consideration to cable systems with semi-annual
gross subscriber receipts of less than $160,000 ($320,000 annually). The royalty fee schedules for cable
systems in this category are specified in subclauses (C) and (D).
In lieu of the payments required in subclause (B), systems earning less than $80,000, semi-annually, are to
[Release Point 118-106]
pay a royalty fee of .5 of 1 percent of gross receipts. Gross receipts under this provision are computed,
however, by subtracting from actual gross receipts collected during the payment period the amount by which
$80,000 exceeds such actual gross receipts. Thus, if the actual gross receipts of the cable system for the period
covered are $60,000, the fee is determined by subtracting $20,000 (the amount by which $80,000 exceeds
actual gross receipts) from $60,000 and applying .5 of 1 percent to the $40,000 result. However, gross receipts
in no case are to be reduced to less than $3,000.
Under subclause (D), cable systems with semi-annual gross subscriber receipts of between $80,000 and
$160,000 are to pay royalty fees of .5 of 1 percent of such actual gross receipts up to $80,000, and 1 percent of
any actual gross receipts in excess of $80,000. The royalty fee payments under both subclauses (C) and (D)
are to be determined without regard to the number of distant signal equivalents, if any, carried by the subject
cable systems.
Copyright Royalty Distribution. Section 111(d)(3) provides that the royalty fees paid by cable systems
under the compulsory license shall be received by the Register of Copyrights and, after deducting the
reasonable costs incurred by the Copyright Office, deposited in the Treasury of the United States. The fees are
distributed subsequently, pursuant to the determination of the Copyright Royalty Commission under chapter 8
[§801 et seq. of this title].
The copyright owners entitled to participate in the distribution of the royalty fees paid by cable systems
under the compulsory license are specified in section 111(d)(4). Consistent with the Committee's view that
copyright royalty fees should be made only for the retransmission of distant non-network programming, the
claimants are limited to (1) copyright owners whose works were included in a secondary transmission made
by a cable system of a distant non-network television program; (2) any copyright owner whose work is
included in a secondary transmission identified in a special statement of account deposited under section
111(d)(2)(A); and (3) any copyright owner whose work was included in distant non-network programming
consisting exclusively of aural signals. Thus, no royalty fees may be claimed or distributed to copyright
owners for the retransmission of either "local" or "network" programs.
The Committee recognizes that the bill does not include specific provisions to guide the Copyright Royalty
Commission in determining the appropriate division among competing copyright owners of the royalty fees
collected from cable systems under Section 111. The Committee concluded that it would not be appropriate to
specify particular, limiting standards for distribution. Rather, the Committee believes that the Copyright
Royalty Commission should consider all pertinent data and considerations presented by the claimants.
Should disputes arise, however, between the different classes of copyright claimants, the Committee
believes that the Copyright Royalty Commission should consider that with respect to the copyright owners of
"live" programs identified by the special statement of account deposited under Section 111(d)(2)(A), a special
payment is provided in Section 111(f).
Section 111(d)(5) sets forth the procedure for the distribution of the royalty fees paid by cable systems.
During the month of July of each year, every person claiming to be entitled to compulsory license fees must
file a claim with the Copyright Royalty Commission, in accordance with such provisions as the Commission
shall establish. In particular, the Commission may establish the relevant period covered by such claims after
giving adequate time for copyright owners to review and consider the statements of account filed by cable
systems. Notwithstanding any provisions of the antitrust laws, the claimants may agree among themselves as
to the division and distribution of such fees. After the first day of August of each year, the Copyright Royalty
Commission shall determine whether a controversy exists concerning the distribution of royalty fees. If no
controversy exists, the Commission, after deducting its reasonable administrative costs, shall distribute the
fees to the copyright owners entitled or their agents. If the Commission finds the existence of a controversy, it
shall, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 8 [§801 et seq. of this title], conduct a proceeding to determine the
distribution of royalty fees.
Off-Shore Taping by Cable Systems. Section 111(e) establishes the conditions and limitation upon which
certain cable systems located outside the continental United States, and specified in subsection (f), may make
tapes of copyrighted programs and retransmit the taped programs to their subscribers upon payment of the
compulsory license fee. These conditions and limitations include compliance with detailed transmission,
record keeping, and other requirements. Their purpose is to control carefully the use of any tapes made
pursuant to the limited recording and retransmission authority established in subsection (f), and to insure that
the limited objective of assimilating offshore cable systems to systems within the United States for purposes
of the compulsory license is not exceeded. Any secondary transmission by a cable system entitled to the
benefits of the taping authorization that does not comply with the requirements of section 111(e) is an act of
infringement and is fully subject to all the remedies provided in the legislation for such actions.
Definitions. Section 111(f) contains a series of definitions. These definitions are found in subsection (f)
rather than in section 101 because of their particular application to secondary transmissions by cable systems.
[Release Point 118-106]
Primary and Secondary Transmissions. The definitions of "primary transmission" and "secondary
transmission" have been discussed above. The definition of "secondary transmission" also contains a provision
permitting the nonsimultaneous retransmission of a primary transmission if by a cable system "not located in
whole or in part within the boundary of the forty-eight contiguous states, Hawaii or Puerto Rico." Under a
proviso, however, a cable system in Hawaii may make a nonsimultaneous retransmission of a primary
transmission if the carriage of the television broadcast signal comprising such further transmission is
permissible under the rules, regulations or authorizations of the FCC.
The effect of this definition is to permit certain cable systems in offshore areas, but not including cable
systems in the offshore area of Puerto Rico and to a limited extent only in Hawaii, to tape programs and
retransmit them to subscribers under the compulsory license. Puerto Rico was excluded based upon a
communication the Committee received from the Governor of Puerto Rico stating that the particular television
broadcasting problems which the definition seeks to solve for cable systems in other noncontiguous areas do
not exist in Puerto Rico. He therefore requested that Puerto Rico be excluded from the scope of the definition.
All cable systems covered by the definition are subject to the conditions and limitations for nonsimultaneous
transmissions established in section 111(e).
Cable System. The definition of a "cable system" establishes that it is a facility that in whole or in part
receives signals of one or more television broadcast stations licensed by the FCC and makes secondary
transmissions of such signals to subscribing members of the public who pay for such service. A closed circuit
wire system that only originates programs and does not carry television broadcast signals would not come
within the definition. Further, the definition provides that, in determining the applicable royalty fee and
system classification under subsection (d)(2)(B), (C), or (D) cable systems in contiguous communities under
common ownership or control or operating from one headend are considered as one system.
Local Service Area of a Primary Transmitter. The definition of "local service area of a primary transmitter"
establishes the difference between "local" and "distant" signals and therefore the line between signals which
are subject to payment under the compulsory license and those that are not. It provides that the local service
area of a television broadcast station is the area in which the station is entitled to insist upon its signal being
retransmitted by a cable system pursuant to FCC rules and regulations. Under FCC rules and regulations this
so-called "must carry" area is defined based on the market size and position of cable systems in 47 C.F.R.
§§76.57, 76.59, 76.61 and 76.63. The definition is limited, however, to the FCC rules in effect on April 15,
1976. The purpose of this limitation is to insure that any subsequent rule amendments by the FCC that either
increase or decrease the size of the local service area for its purposes do not change the definition for
copyright purposes. The Committee believes that any such change for copyright purposes, which would
materially affect the royalty fee payments provided in the legislation, should only be made by an amendment
to the statute.
The "local service area of a primary transmitter" of a Canadian or Mexican television station is defined as
the area in which such station would be entitled to insist upon its signals being retransmitted if it were a
television broadcast station subject to FCC rules and regulations. Since the FCC does not permit a television
station licensed in a foreign country to assert a claim to carriage by a U.S. cable system, the local service area
of such foreign station is considered to be the same area as if it were a U.S. station.
The local service area for a radio broadcast station is defined to mean "the primary service area of such
station pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission." The term "primary
service area" is defined precisely by the FCC with regard to AM stations in Section 73.11(a) of the FCC's
rules. In the case of FM stations, "primary service area" is regarded by the FCC as the area included within the
field strength contours specified in Section 73.311 of its rules.
Distant Signal Equivalent. The definition of a "distant signal equivalent" is central to the computation of the
royalty fees payable under the compulsory license. It is the value assigned to the secondary transmission of
any non-network television programming carried by a cable system, in whole or in part, beyond the local
service area of the primary transmitter of such programming. It is computed by assigning a value of one (1) to
each distant independent station and a value of one-quarter (¼) to each distant network station and distant
noncommercial educational station carried by a cable system, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC.
Thus, a cable system carrying two distant independent stations, two distant network stations and one distant
noncommercial educational station would have a total of 2.75 distant signal equivalents.
The values assigned to independent, network and noncommercial educational stations are subject, however,
to certain exceptions and limitations. Two of these relate to the mandatory and discretionary program deletion
and substitution rules of the FCC. Where the FCC rules require a cable system to omit certain programs (e.g.,
the syndicated program exclusivity rules) and also permit the substitution of another program in place of the
omitted program, no additional value is assigned for the substituted or additional program. Further, where the
FCC rules on the date of enactment of this legislation permit a cable system, at its discretion, to make such
[Release Point 118-106]
deletions or substitutions or to carry additional programs not transmitted by primary transmitters within whose
local service area the cable system is located, no additional value is assigned for the substituted or additional
programs. However, the latter discretionary exception is subject to a condition that if the substituted or
additional program is a "live" program (e.g., a sports event), then an additional value is assigned to the
carriage of the distant signal computed as a fraction of one distant signal equivalent. The fraction is
determined by assigning to the numerator the number of days in the year on which the "live" substitution
occurs, and by assigning to the denominator the number of days in the year. Further, the discretionary
exception is limited to those FCC rules in effect on the date of enactment of this legislation [Oct. 19, 1976]. If
subsequent FCC rule amendments or individual authorizations enlarge the discretionary ability of cable
systems to delete and substitute programs, such deletions and substitutions would be counted at the full value
assigned the particular type of station provided above.
Two further exceptions pertain to the late-night or specialty programming rules of the FCC or to a station
carried on a part-time basis where full-time carriage is not possible because the cable system lacks the
activated channel capacity to retransmit on a full-time basis all signals which it is authorized to carry. In this
event, the values for independent, network and noncommercial, educational stations set forth above, as the
case may be, are determined by multiplying each by a fraction which is equal to the ratio of the broadcast
hours of such station carried by the cable system to the total broadcast hours of the station.
Network Station. A "network station" is defined as a television broadcast station that is owned or operated
by, or affiliated with, one or more of the U.S. television networks providing nationwide transmissions and that
transmits a substantial part of the programming supplied by such networks for a substantial part of that
station's typical broadcast day. To qualify as a network station, all the conditions of the definition must be
met. Thus, the retransmission of a Canadian station affiliated with a Canadian network would not qualify
under the definition. Further, a station affiliated with a regional network would not qualify, since a regional
network would not provide nationwide transmissions. However, a station affiliated with a network providing
nationwide transmissions that also occasionally carries regional programs would qualify as a "network
station," if the station transmits a substantial part of the programming supplied by the network for a substantial
part of the station's typical broadcast day.
Independent Station. An "independent station" is defined as a commercial television broadcast station other
than a network station. Any commercial station that does not fall within the definition of "network station" is
classified as an "independent station."
Noncommercial Educational Station. A "noncommercial educational station" is defined as a television
station that is a noncommercial educational broadcast station within the meaning of section 397 of title 47 [47
U.S.C. 397].

§112. Limitations on exclusive rights: Ephemeral recordings
(a)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, and except in the case of a motion picture or
other audiovisual work, it is not an infringement of copyright for a transmitting organization entitled
to transmit to the public a performance or display of a work, under a license, including a statutory
license under section 114(f), or transfer of the copyright or under the limitations on exclusive rights
in sound recordings specified by section 114(a), or for a transmitting organization that is a broadcast
radio or television station licensed as such by the Federal Communications Commission and that
makes a broadcast transmission of a performance of a sound recording in a digital format on a
nonsubscription basis, to make no more than one copy or phonorecord of a particular transmission
program embodying the performance or display, if—
(A) the copy or phonorecord is retained and used solely by the transmitting organization that
made it, and no further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from it; and
(B) the copy or phonorecord is used solely for the transmitting organization's own transmissions
within its local service area, or for purposes of archival preservation or security; and
(C) unless preserved exclusively for archival purposes, the copy or phonorecord is destroyed
within six months from the date the transmission program was first transmitted to the public.
(2) In a case in which a transmitting organization entitled to make a copy or phonorecord under
paragraph (1) in connection with the transmission to the public of a performance or display of a work
is prevented from making such copy or phonorecord by reason of the application by the copyright
owner of technical measures that prevent the reproduction of the work, the copyright owner shall
make available to the transmitting organization the necessary means for permitting the making of
such copy or phonorecord as permitted under that paragraph, if it is technologically feasible and
economically reasonable for the copyright owner to do so. If the copyright owner fails to do so in a
timely manner in light of the transmitting organization's reasonable business requirements, the
transmitting organization shall not be liable for a violation of section 1201(a)(1) of this title for
engaging in such activities as are necessary to make such copies or phonorecords as permitted under
paragraph (1) of this subsection.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an infringement of copyright for a
governmental body or other nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance or display of a
work, under section 110(2) or under the limitations on exclusive rights in sound recordings specified
by section 114(a), to make no more than thirty copies or phonorecords of a particular transmission
program embodying the performance or display, if—
(1) no further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from the copies or phonorecords made
under this clause; and
(2) except for one copy or phonorecord that may be preserved exclusively for archival purposes,
the copies or phonorecords are destroyed within seven years from the date the transmission
program was first transmitted to the public.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an infringement of copyright for a
governmental body or other nonprofit organization to make for distribution no more than one copy or
phonorecord, for each transmitting organization specified in clause (2) of this subsection, of a
particular transmission program embodying a performance of a nondramatic musical work of a
religious nature, or of a sound recording of such a musical work, if—
(1) there is no direct or indirect charge for making or distributing any such copies or
phonorecords; and
(2) none of such copies or phonorecords is used for any performance other than a single
[Release Point 118-106]
transmission to the public by a transmitting organization entitled to transmit to the public a
performance of the work under a license or transfer of the copyright; and
(3) except for one copy or phonorecord that may be preserved exclusively for archival purposes,
the copies or phonorecords are all destroyed within one year from the date the transmission
program was first transmitted to the public.
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an infringement of copyright for a
governmental body or other nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance of a work
under section 110(8) to make no more than ten copies or phonorecords embodying the performance,
or to permit the use of any such copy or phonorecord by any governmental body or nonprofit
organization entitled to transmit a performance of a work under section 110(8), if—
(1) any such copy or phonorecord is retained and used solely by the organization that made it,
or by a governmental body or nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance of a work
under section 110(8), and no further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from it; and
(2) any such copy or phonorecord is used solely for transmissions authorized under section
110(8), or for purposes of archival preservation or security; and
(3) the governmental body or nonprofit organization permitting any use of any such copy or
phonorecord by any governmental body or nonprofit organization under this subsection does not
make any charge for such use.
(e) STATUTORY LICENSE.—(1) A transmitting organization entitled to transmit to the public a
performance of a sound recording under the limitation on exclusive rights specified by section
114(d)(1)(C)(iv) or under a statutory license in accordance with section 114(f) is entitled to a
statutory license, under the conditions specified by this subsection, to make no more than 1
phonorecord of the sound recording (unless the terms and conditions of the statutory license allow
for more), if the following conditions are satisfied:
(A) The phonorecord is retained and used solely by the transmitting organization that made it,
and no further phonorecords are reproduced from it.
(B) The phonorecord is used solely for the transmitting organization's own transmissions
originating in the United States under a statutory license in accordance with section 114(f) or the
limitation on exclusive rights specified by section 114(d)(1)(C)(iv).
(C) Unless preserved exclusively for purposes of archival preservation, the phonorecord is
destroyed within 6 months from the date the sound recording was first transmitted to the public
using the phonorecord.
(D) Phonorecords of the sound recording have been distributed to the public under the authority
of the copyright owner or the copyright owner authorizes the transmitting entity to transmit the
sound recording, and the transmitting entity makes the phonorecord under this subsection from a
phonorecord lawfully made and acquired under the authority of the copyright owner.
(2) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, any copyright owners of sound recordings
and any transmitting organizations entitled to a statutory license under this subsection may negotiate
and agree upon royalty rates and license terms and conditions for making phonorecords of such
sound recordings under this section and the proportionate division of fees paid among copyright
owners, and may designate common agents to negotiate, agree to, pay, or receive such royalty
payments.
(3) Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable rates and terms of royalty payments
for the activities specified by paragraph (1) during the 5-year period beginning on January 1 of the
second year following the year in which the proceedings are to be commenced, or such other period
as the parties may agree. Such rates shall include a minimum fee for each type of service offered by
transmitting organizations. Any copyright owners of sound recordings or any transmitting
organizations entitled to a statutory license under this subsection may submit to the Copyright
Royalty Judges licenses covering such activities with respect to such sound recordings. The parties to
each proceeding shall bear their own costs.
[Release Point 118-106]
(4) The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges shall,
subject to paragraph (5), be binding on all copyright owners of sound recordings and transmitting
organizations entitled to a statutory license under this subsection during the 5-year period specified
in paragraph (3), or such other period as the parties may agree. Such rates shall include a minimum
fee for each type of service offered by transmitting organizations. The Copyright Royalty Judges
shall establish rates that most clearly represent the fees that would have been negotiated in the
marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller. In determining such rates and terms, the
Copyright Royalty Judges shall base their decision on economic, competitive, and programming
information presented by the parties, including—
(A) whether use of the service may substitute for or may promote the sales of phonorecords or
otherwise interferes with or enhances the copyright owner's traditional streams of revenue; and
(B) the relative roles of the copyright owner and the transmitting organization in the
copyrighted work and the service made available to the public with respect to relative creative
contribution, technological contribution, capital investment, cost, and risk.
In establishing such rates and terms, the Copyright Royalty Judges may consider the rates and
terms under voluntary license agreements described in paragraphs (2) and (3). The Copyright
Royalty Judges shall also establish requirements by which copyright owners may receive reasonable
notice of the use of their sound recordings under this section, and under which records of such use
shall be kept and made available by transmitting organizations entitled to obtain a statutory license
under this subsection.
(5) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time between 1 or more copyright owners of
sound recordings and 1 or more transmitting organizations entitled to obtain a statutory license under
this subsection shall be given effect in lieu of any decision by the Librarian of Congress or
determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
(6)(A) Any person who wishes to make a phonorecord of a sound recording under a statutory
license in accordance with this subsection may do so without infringing the exclusive right of the
copyright owner of the sound recording under section 106(1)—
(i) by complying with such notice requirements as the Copyright Royalty Judges shall prescribe
by regulation and by paying royalty fees in accordance with this subsection; or
(ii) if such royalty fees have not been set, by agreeing to pay such royalty fees as shall be
determined in accordance with this subsection.
(B) Any royalty payments in arrears shall be made on or before the 20th day of the month next
succeeding the month in which the royalty fees are set.
(7) If a transmitting organization entitled to make a phonorecord under this subsection is
prevented from making such phonorecord by reason of the application by the copyright owner of
technical measures that prevent the reproduction of the sound recording, the copyright owner shall
make available to the transmitting organization the necessary means for permitting the making of
such phonorecord as permitted under this subsection, if it is technologically feasible and
economically reasonable for the copyright owner to do so. If the copyright owner fails to do so in a
timely manner in light of the transmitting organization's reasonable business requirements, the
transmitting organization shall not be liable for a violation of section 1201(a)(1) of this title for
engaging in such activities as are necessary to make such phonorecords as permitted under this
subsection.
(8) Nothing in this subsection annuls, limits, impairs, or otherwise affects in any way the existence
or value of any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owners in a sound recording, except as
otherwise provided in this subsection, or in a musical work, including the exclusive rights to
reproduce and distribute a sound recording or musical work, including by means of a digital
phonorecord delivery, under sections 106(1), 106(3), and 115, and the right to perform publicly a
sound recording or musical work, including by means of a digital audio transmission, under sections
106(4) and 106(6).
(f)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, and without limiting the application of
[Release Point 118-106]
subsection (b), it is not an infringement of copyright for a governmental body or other nonprofit
educational institution entitled under section 110(2) to transmit a performance or display to make
copies or phonorecords of a work that is in digital form and, solely to the extent permitted in
paragraph (2), of a work that is in analog form, embodying the performance or display to be used for
making transmissions authorized under section 110(2), if—
(A) such copies or phonorecords are retained and used solely by the body or institution that
made them, and no further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from them, except as authorized
under section 110(2); and
(B) such copies or phonorecords are used solely for transmissions authorized under section
110(2).
(2) This subsection does not authorize the conversion of print or other analog versions of works
into digital formats, except that such conversion is permitted hereunder, only with respect to the
amount of such works authorized to be performed or displayed under section 110(2), if—
(A) no digital version of the work is available to the institution; or
(B) the digital version of the work that is available to the institution is subject to technological
protection measures that prevent its use for section 110(2).
(g) The transmission program embodied in a copy or phonorecord made under this section is not
subject to protection as a derivative work under this title except with the express consent of the
owners of copyright in the preexisting works employed in the program.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Section 112 of the bill concerns itself with a special problem that is not dealt with in the present statutes but
is the subject of provisions in a number of foreign statutes and in the revisions of the Berne Convention since
1948. This is the problem of what are commonly called "ephemeral recordings": copies or phonorecords of a
work made for purposes of later transmission by a broadcasting organization legally entitled to transmit the
work. In other words, where a broadcaster has the privilege of performing or displaying a work either because
he is licensed or because the performance or display is exempted under the statute, the question is whether he
should be given the additional privilege of recording the performance or display to facilitate its transmission.
The need for a limited exemption in these cases because of the practical exigencies of broadcasting has been
generally recognized, but the scope of the exemption has been a controversial issue.
Recordings for Licensed Transmissions. Under subsection (a) of section 112, an organization that has
acquired the right to transmit any work (other than a motion picture or other audiovisual work), or that is free
to transmit a sound recording under section 114, may make a single copy or phonorecord of a particular
program embodying the work, if the copy or phonorecord is used solely for the organization's own
transmissions within its own area; after 6 months it must be destroyed or preserved solely for archival
purposes.
Organizations Covered.—The ephemeral recording privilege is given by subsection (a) to "a transmitting
organization entitled to transmit to the public a performance or display of a work." Assuming that the
transmission meets the other conditions of the provision, it makes no difference what type of public
transmission the organization is making: commercial radio and television broadcasts, public radio and
television broadcasts not exempted by section 110(2), pay-TV, closed circuit, background music, and so forth.
However, to come within the scope of subsection (a), the organization must have the right to make the
transmission "under a license or transfer of the copyright or under the limitations on exclusive rights in sound
recordings specified by section 114(a)." Thus, except in the case of copyrighted sound recordings (which have
no exclusive performing rights under the bill), the organization must be a transferee or licensee (including
compulsory licensee) of performing rights in the work in order to make an ephemeral recording of it.
Some concern has been expressed by authors and publishers lest the term "organization" be construed to
include a number of affiliated broadcasters who could exchange the recording without restrictions. The term is
[Release Point 118-106]
intended to cover a broadcasting network, or a local broadcaster or individual transmitter; but, under clauses
(1) and (2) of the subsection, the ephemeral recording must be "retained and used solely by the transmitting
organization that made it," and must be used solely for that organization's own transmissions within its own
area. Thus, an ephemeral recording made by one transmitter, whether it be a network or local broadcaster,
could not be made available for use by another transmitter. Likewise, this subsection does not apply to those
nonsimultaneous transmissions by cable systems not located within a boundary of the forty-eight contiguous
States that are granted a compulsory license under section 111.
Scope of the Privilege.—Subsection (a) permits the transmitting organization to make "no more than one
copy or phonorecord of a particular transmission program embodying the performance or display." A
"transmission program" is defined in section 101 as a body of material produced for the sole purpose of
transmission as a unit. Thus, under section 112(a), a transmitter could make only one copy or phonorecord of
a particular "transmission program" containing a copyrighted work, but would not be limited as to the number
of times the work itself could be duplicated as part of other "transmission programs."
Three specific limitations on the scope of the ephemeral recording privilege are set out in subsection (a),
and unless all are met the making of an "ephemeral recording" becomes fully actionable as an infringement.
The first requires that the copy or phonorecord be "retained and used solely by the transmitting organization
that made it," and that "no further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from it." This means that a
transmitting organization would have no privilege of exchanging ephemeral recordings with other transmitters
or of allowing them to duplicate their own ephemeral recordings from the copy or phonorecord it has made.
There is nothing in the provision to prevent a transmitting organization from having an ephemeral recording
made by means of facilities other than its own, although it would not be permissible for a person or
organization other than a transmitting organization to make a recording on its own initiative for possible sale
or lease to a broadcaster. The ephemeral recording privilege would extend to copies or phonorecords made in
advance for later broadcast, as well as recordings of a program that are made while it is being transmitted and
are intended for deferred transmission or preservation.
Clause (2) of section 112(a) provides that, to be exempt from copyright, the copy or phonorecord must be
"used solely for the transmitting organization's own transmissions within its local service area, or for purposes
of archival preservation or security". The term "local service area" is defined in section 111(f).
Clause (3) of section 112(a) provides that, unless preserved exclusively for archival purposes, the copy or
phonorecord of a transmission program must be destroyed within six months from the date the transmission
program was first transmitted to the public.
Recordings for Instructional Transmissions. Section 112(b) represents a response to the arguments of
instructional broadcasters and other educational groups for special recording privileges, although it does not
go as far as these groups requested. In general, it permits a nonprofit organization that is free to transmit a
performance or display of a work, under section 110(2) or under the limitations on exclusive rights in sound
recordings specified by section 114(a), to make not more than thirty copies or phonorecords and to use the
ephemeral recordings for transmitting purposes for not more than seven years after the initial transmission.
Organizations Covered.—The privilege of making ephemeral recordings under section 112(b) extends to a
"governmental body or other nonprofit organization entitled to transmit a performance or display of a work
under section 110(2) or under the limitations on exclusive rights in sound recordings specified by section
114(a)." Aside from phonorecords of copyrighted sound recordings, the ephemeral recordings made by an
instructional broadcaster under subsection (b) must embody a performance or display that meets all of the
qualifications for exemption under section 110(2). Copies or phonorecords made for educational broadcasts of
a general cultural nature, or for transmission as part of an information storage and retrieval system, would not
be exempted from copyright protection under section 112(b).
Motion Pictures and Other Audiovisual Works.—Since the performance exemption provided by section
110(2) applies only to nondramatic literary and musical works, there was no need to exclude motion pictures
and other audiovisual works explicitly from the scope of section 112(b). Another point stressed by the
producers of educational films in this connection, however, was that ephemeral recordings made by
instructional broadcasters are in fact audiovisual works that often compete for exactly the same market. They
argued that it is unfair to allow instructional broadcasters to reproduce multiple copies of films and tapes, and
to exchange them with other broadcasters, without paying any copyright royalties, thereby directly injuring the
market of producers of audiovisual works who now pay substantial fees to authors for the same uses. These
arguments are persuasive and justify the placing of reasonable limits on the recording privilege.
Scope of the Privilege.—Under subsection (b) an instructional broadcaster may make "no more than thirty
copies or phonorecords of a particular transmission program embodying the performance or display." No
further copies or phonorecords can be reproduced from those made under section 112(b), either by the
nonprofit organization that made them or by anyone else.
[Release Point 118-106]
On the other hand, if the nonprofit organization does nothing directly or indirectly to authorize, induce, or
encourage others to duplicate additional copies or phonorecords of an ephemeral recording in excess of the
limit of thirty, it would not be held responsible as participating in the infringement in such a case, and the
unauthorized copies would not be counted against the organization's total of thirty.
Unlike ephemeral recordings made under subsection (a), exchanges of recordings among instructional
broadcasters are permitted. An organization that has made copies or phonorecords under subsection (b) may
use one of them for purposes of its own transmissions that are exempted by section 110(2), and it may also
transfer the other 29 copies to other instructional broadcasters for use in the same way.
As in the case of ephemeral recordings made under section 112(a), a copy or phonorecord made for
instructional broadcasting could be reused in any number of transmissions within the time limits specified in
the provision. Because of the special problems of instructional broadcasters resulting from the scheduling of
courses and the need to prerecord well in advance of transmission, the period of use has been extended to
seven years from the date the transmission program was first transmitted to the public.
Religious Broadcasts.—Section 112(c) provides that it is not an infringement of copyright for certain
nonprofit organizations to make no more than one copy for each transmitting organization of a broadcast
program embodying a performance of a nondramatic musical work of a religious nature or of a sound
recording of such a musical work. In order for this exception to be applicable there must be no charge for the
distribution of the copies, none of the copies may be used for any performance other than a single
transmission by an organization possessing a license to transmit a copyrighted work, and, other than for one
copy that may be preserved for archival purposes, the remaining copies must be destroyed within one year
from the date the program was first transmitted to the public.
Despite objections by music copyright owners, the Committee found this exemption to be justified by the
special circumstances under which many religious programs are broadcast. These programs are produced on
tape or disk for distribution by mail of one copy only to each broadcast station carrying the program. None of
the programs are prepared for profit, and the program producer either pays the station to carry the program or
furnishes it free of charge. The stations have performing licenses, so the copyright owners receive
compensation. Following the performance, the tape is returned or the disk destroyed. It seems likely that, as
has been alleged, to require a second payment for the mechanical reproduction under these circumstances
would simply have the effect of driving some of the copyrighted music off the air.
Ephemeral Recordings for Transmissions to Handicapped Audiences. As a counterpart to its
amendment of section 110(8), the Committee adopted a new provision, subsection (d) of section 112, to
provide an ephemeral recording exemption in the case of transmissions to the blind and deaf. New subsection
would permit the making of one recording of a performance exempted under section 110(8), and its retention
for an unlimited period. It would not permit the making of further reproductions or their exchange with other
organizations.
Copyright Status of Ephemeral Recordings. A program reproduced in an ephemeral recording made
under section 112 in many cases will constitute a motion picture, a sound recording, or some other kind of
derivative work, and will thus be potentially copyrightable under section 103. In section 112(e) it is provided
that ephemeral recordings are not to be copyrightable as derivative works except with the consent of the
owners of the copyrighted material employed in them.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Section 113 deals with the extent of copyright protection in "works of applied art." The section takes as its
starting point the Supreme Court's decision in Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201 (1954) [74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed.
630, rehearing denied 74 S.Ct. 637, 347 U.S. 949, 98 L.Ed. 1096], and the first sentence of subsection (a)
restates the basic principle established by that decision. The rule of Mazer, as affirmed by the bill, is that
copyright in a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work will not be affected if the work is employed as the design
of a useful article, and will afford protection to the copyright owner against the unauthorized reproduction of
his work in useful as well as nonuseful articles. The terms "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works" and
"useful article" are defined in section 101, and these definitions are discussed above in connection with section
102.
The broad language of section 106(1) and of subsection (a) of section 113 raises questions as to the extent
of copyright protection for a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work that portrays, depicts, or represents an
[Release Point 118-106]
image of a useful article in such a way that the utilitarian nature of the article can be seen. To take the example
usually cited, would copyright in a drawing or model of an automobile give the artist the exclusive right to
make automobiles of the same design?
The 1961 Report of the Register of Copyrights stated, on the basis of judicial precedent, that "copyright in a
pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, portraying a useful article as such, does not extend to the manufacture of
the useful article itself," and recommended specifically that "the distinctions drawn in this area by existing
court decisions" not be altered by the statute. The Register's Supplementary Report, at page 48, cited a number
of these decisions, and explained the insuperable difficulty of finding "any statutory formulation that would
express the distinction satisfactorily." Section 113(b) reflects the Register's conclusion that "the real need is to
make clear that there is no intention to change the present law with respect to the scope of protection in a work
portraying a useful article as such."
Section 113(c) provides that it would not be an infringement of copyright, where a copyright work has been
lawfully published as the design of useful articles, to make, distribute or display pictures of the articles in
advertising, in feature stories about the articles, or in the news reports.
In conformity with its deletion from the bill of Title II, relating to the protection of ornamental designs of
useful articles, the Committee has deleted subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 113 of S. 22 as adopted by
the Senate, since they are no longer relevant.

§114. Scope of exclusive rights in sound recordings
(a) The exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording are limited to the rights
specified by clauses (1), (2), (3) and (6) of section 106, and do not include any right of performance
under section 106(4).
(b) The exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause (1) of section
106 is limited to the right to duplicate the sound recording in the form of phonorecords or copies that
directly or indirectly recapture the actual sounds fixed in the recording. The exclusive right of the
owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause (2) of section 106 is limited to the right to
prepare a derivative work in which the actual sounds fixed in the sound recording are rearranged,
remixed, or otherwise altered in sequence or quality. The exclusive rights of the owner of copyright
in a sound recording under clauses (1) and (2) of section 106 do not extend to the making or
duplication of another sound recording that consists entirely of an independent fixation of other
sounds, even though such sounds imitate or simulate those in the copyrighted sound recording. The
exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clauses (1), (2), and (3) of
section 106 do not apply to sound recordings included in educational television and radio programs
(as defined in section 397 of title 47) distributed or transmitted by or through public broadcasting
entities (as defined by section 118(f)): Provided, That copies or phonorecords of said programs are
not commercially distributed by or through public broadcasting entities to the general public.
(c) This section does not limit or impair the exclusive right to perform publicly, by means of a
phonorecord, any of the works specified by section 106(4).
(d) LIMITATIONS ON EXCLUSIVE RIGHT.—Notwithstanding the provisions of section
[Release Point 118-106]
106(6)—
(1) EXEMPT TRANSMISSIONS AND RETRANSMISSIONS.—The performance of a sound
recording publicly by means of a digital audio transmission, other than as a part of an interactive
service, is not an infringement of section 106(6) if the performance is part of—
(A) a nonsubscription broadcast transmission;
(B) a retransmission of a nonsubscription broadcast transmission: Provided, That, in the case
of a retransmission of a radio station's broadcast transmission—
(i) the radio station's broadcast transmission is not willfully or repeatedly retransmitted
more than a radius of 150 miles from the site of the radio broadcast transmitter, however—
(I) the 150 mile limitation under this clause shall not apply when a nonsubscription
broadcast transmission by a radio station licensed by the Federal Communications
Commission is retransmitted on a nonsubscription basis by a terrestrial broadcast station,
terrestrial translator, or terrestrial repeater licensed by the Federal Communications
Commission; and
(II) in the case of a subscription retransmission of a nonsubscription broadcast
retransmission covered by subclause (I), the 150 mile radius shall be measured from the
transmitter site of such broadcast retransmitter;
(ii) the retransmission is of radio station broadcast transmissions that are—
(I) obtained by the retransmitter over the air;
(II) not electronically processed by the retransmitter to deliver separate and discrete
signals; and
(III) retransmitted only within the local communities served by the retransmitter;
(iii) the radio station's broadcast transmission was being retransmitted to cable systems (as
defined in section 111(f)) by a satellite carrier on January 1, 1995, and that retransmission
was being retransmitted by cable systems as a separate and discrete signal, and the satellite
carrier obtains the radio station's broadcast transmission in an analog format: Provided, That
the broadcast transmission being retransmitted may embody the programming of no more
than one radio station; or
(iv) the radio station's broadcast transmission is made by a noncommercial educational
broadcast station funded on or after January 1, 1995, under section 396(k) of the
Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 396(k)), consists solely of noncommercial
educational and cultural radio programs, and the retransmission, whether or not simultaneous,
is a nonsubscription terrestrial broadcast retransmission; or
(C) a transmission that comes within any of the following categories—
(i) a prior or simultaneous transmission incidental to an exempt transmission, such as a
feed received by and then retransmitted by an exempt transmitter: Provided, That such
incidental transmissions do not include any subscription transmission directly for reception
by members of the public;
(ii) a transmission within a business establishment, confined to its premises or the
immediately surrounding vicinity;
(iii) a retransmission by any retransmitter, including a multichannel video programming
distributor as defined in section 602(12) 1 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.
522(12)), of a transmission by a transmitter licensed to publicly perform the sound recording
as a part of that transmission, if the retransmission is simultaneous with the licensed
transmission and authorized by the transmitter; or
(iv) a transmission to a business establishment for use in the ordinary course of its
business: Provided, That the business recipient does not retransmit the transmission outside
of its premises or the immediately surrounding vicinity, and that the transmission does not
exceed the sound recording performance complement. Nothing in this clause shall limit the
scope of the exemption in clause (ii).
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) STATUTORY LICENSING OF CERTAIN TRANSMISSIONS.—The performance of a
sound recording publicly by means of a subscription digital audio transmission not exempt under
paragraph (1), an eligible nonsubscription transmission, or a transmission not exempt under
paragraph (1) that is made by a preexisting satellite digital audio radio service shall be subject to
statutory licensing, in accordance with subsection (f) if—
(A)(i) the transmission is not part of an interactive service;
(ii) except in the case of a transmission to a business establishment, the transmitting entity
does not automatically and intentionally cause any device receiving the transmission to switch
from one program channel to another; and
(iii) except as provided in section 1002(e), the transmission of the sound recording is
accompanied, if technically feasible, by the information encoded in that sound recording, if any,
by or under the authority of the copyright owner of that sound recording, that identifies the title
of the sound recording, the featured recording artist who performs on the sound recording, and
related information, including information concerning the underlying musical work and its
writer;
(B) in the case of a subscription transmission not exempt under paragraph (1) that is made by
a preexisting subscription service in the same transmission medium used by such service on
July 31, 1998, or in the case of a transmission not exempt under paragraph (1) that is made by a
preexisting satellite digital audio radio service—
(i) the transmission does not exceed the sound recording performance complement; and
(ii) the transmitting entity does not cause to be published by means of an advance program
schedule or prior announcement the titles of the specific sound recordings or phonorecords
embodying such sound recordings to be transmitted; and
(C) in the case of an eligible nonsubscription transmission or a subscription transmission not
exempt under paragraph (1) that is made by a new subscription service or by a preexisting
subscription service other than in the same transmission medium used by such service on July
31, 1998—
(i) the transmission does not exceed the sound recording performance complement, except
that this requirement shall not apply in the case of a retransmission of a broadcast
transmission if the retransmission is made by a transmitting entity that does not have the right
or ability to control the programming of the broadcast station making the broadcast
transmission, unless—
(I) the broadcast station makes broadcast transmissions—
(aa) in digital format that regularly exceed the sound recording performance
complement; or
(bb) in analog format, a substantial portion of which, on a weekly basis, exceed the
sound recording performance complement; and
(II) the sound recording copyright owner or its representative has notified the
transmitting entity in writing that broadcast transmissions of the copyright owner's sound
recordings exceed the sound recording performance complement as provided in this clause;
(ii) the transmitting entity does not cause to be published, or induce or facilitate the
publication, by means of an advance program schedule or prior announcement, the titles of
the specific sound recordings to be transmitted, the phonorecords embodying such sound
recordings, or, other than for illustrative purposes, the names of the featured recording artists,
except that this clause does not disqualify a transmitting entity that makes a prior
announcement that a particular artist will be featured within an unspecified future time
period, and in the case of a retransmission of a broadcast transmission by a transmitting entity
that does not have the right or ability to control the programming of the broadcast
transmission, the requirement of this clause shall not apply to a prior oral announcement by
[Release Point 118-106]
the broadcast station, or to an advance program schedule published, induced, or facilitated by
the broadcast station, if the transmitting entity does not have actual knowledge and has not
received written notice from the copyright owner or its representative that the broadcast
station publishes or induces or facilitates the publication of such advance program schedule,
or if such advance program schedule is a schedule of classical music programming published
by the broadcast station in the same manner as published by that broadcast station on or
before September 30, 1998;
(iii) the transmission—
(I) is not part of an archived program of less than 5 hours duration;
(II) is not part of an archived program of 5 hours or greater in duration that is made
available for a period exceeding 2 weeks;
(III) is not part of a continuous program which is of less than 3 hours duration; or
(IV) is not part of an identifiable program in which performances of sound recordings
are rendered in a predetermined order, other than an archived or continuous program, that
is transmitted at—
(aa) more than 3 times in any 2-week period that have been publicly announced in
advance, in the case of a program of less than 1 hour in duration, or
(bb) more than 4 times in any 2-week period that have been publicly announced in
advance, in the case of a program of 1 hour or more in duration,
except that the requirement of this subclause shall not apply in the case of a retransmission
of a broadcast transmission by a transmitting entity that does not have the right or ability to
control the programming of the broadcast transmission, unless the transmitting entity is
given notice in writing by the copyright owner of the sound recording that the broadcast
station makes broadcast transmissions that regularly violate such requirement;
(iv) the transmitting entity does not knowingly perform the sound recording, as part of a
service that offers transmissions of visual images contemporaneously with transmissions of
sound recordings, in a manner that is likely to cause confusion, to cause mistake, or to
deceive, as to the affiliation, connection, or association of the copyright owner or featured
recording artist with the transmitting entity or a particular product or service advertised by
the transmitting entity, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval by the copyright owner or
featured recording artist of the activities of the transmitting entity other than the performance
of the sound recording itself;
(v) the transmitting entity cooperates to prevent, to the extent feasible without imposing
substantial costs or burdens, a transmission recipient or any other person or entity from
automatically scanning the transmitting entity's transmissions alone or together with
transmissions by other transmitting entities in order to select a particular sound recording to
be transmitted to the transmission recipient, except that the requirement of this clause shall
not apply to a satellite digital audio service that is in operation, or that is licensed by the
Federal Communications Commission, on or before July 31, 1998;
(vi) the transmitting entity takes no affirmative steps to cause or induce the making of a
phonorecord by the transmission recipient, and if the technology used by the transmitting
entity enables the transmitting entity to limit the making by the transmission recipient of
phonorecords of the transmission directly in a digital format, the transmitting entity sets such
technology to limit such making of phonorecords to the extent permitted by such technology;
(vii) phonorecords of the sound recording have been distributed to the public under the
authority of the copyright owner or the copyright owner authorizes the transmitting entity to
transmit the sound recording, and the transmitting entity makes the transmission from a
phonorecord lawfully made under the authority of the copyright owner, except that the
requirement of this clause shall not apply to a retransmission of a broadcast transmission by a
transmitting entity that does not have the right or ability to control the programming of the
broadcast transmission, unless the transmitting entity is given notice in writing by the
[Release Point 118-106]
copyright owner of the sound recording that the broadcast station makes broadcast
transmissions that regularly violate such requirement;
(viii) the transmitting entity accommodates and does not interfere with the transmission of
technical measures that are widely used by sound recording copyright owners to identify or
protect copyrighted works, and that are technically feasible of being transmitted by the
transmitting entity without imposing substantial costs on the transmitting entity or resulting in
perceptible aural or visual degradation of the digital signal, except that the requirement of this
clause shall not apply to a satellite digital audio service that is in operation, or that is licensed
under the authority of the Federal Communications Commission, on or before July 31, 1998,
to the extent that such service has designed, developed, or made commitments to procure
equipment or technology that is not compatible with such technical measures before such
technical measures are widely adopted by sound recording copyright owners; and
(ix) the transmitting entity identifies in textual data the sound recording during, but not
before, the time it is performed, including the title of the sound recording, the title of the
phonorecord embodying such sound recording, if any, and the featured recording artist, in a
manner to permit it to be displayed to the transmission recipient by the device or technology
intended for receiving the service provided by the transmitting entity, except that the
obligation in this clause shall not take effect until 1 year after the date of the enactment of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act and shall not apply in the case of a retransmission of a
broadcast transmission by a transmitting entity that does not have the right or ability to
control the programming of the broadcast transmission, or in the case in which devices or
technology intended for receiving the service provided by the transmitting entity that have the
capability to display such textual data are not common in the marketplace.
(3) LICENSES FOR TRANSMISSIONS BY INTERACTIVE SERVICES.—
(A) No interactive service shall be granted an exclusive license under section 106(6) for the
performance of a sound recording publicly by means of digital audio transmission for a period
in excess of 12 months, except that with respect to an exclusive license granted to an interactive
service by a licensor that holds the copyright to 1,000 or fewer sound recordings, the period of
such license shall not exceed 24 months: Provided, however, That the grantee of such exclusive
license shall be ineligible to receive another exclusive license for the performance of that sound
recording for a period of 13 months from the expiration of the prior exclusive license.
(B) The limitation set forth in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply if—
(i) the licensor has granted and there remain in effect licenses under section 106(6) for the
public performance of sound recordings by means of digital audio transmission by at least 5
different interactive services: Provided, however, That each such license must be for a
minimum of 10 percent of the copyrighted sound recordings owned by the licensor that have
been licensed to interactive services, but in no event less than 50 sound recordings; or
(ii) the exclusive license is granted to perform publicly up to 45 seconds of a sound
recording and the sole purpose of the performance is to promote the distribution or
performance of that sound recording.
(C) Notwithstanding the grant of an exclusive or nonexclusive license of the right of public
performance under section 106(6), an interactive service may not publicly perform a sound
recording unless a license has been granted for the public performance of any copyrighted
musical work contained in the sound recording: Provided, That such license to publicly perform
the copyrighted musical work may be granted either by a performing rights society representing
the copyright owner or by the copyright owner.
(D) The performance of a sound recording by means of a retransmission of a digital audio
transmission is not an infringement of section 106(6) if—
(i) the retransmission is of a transmission by an interactive service licensed to publicly
perform the sound recording to a particular member of the public as part of that transmission;
and
[Release Point 118-106]
(ii) the retransmission is simultaneous with the licensed transmission, authorized by the
transmitter, and limited to that particular member of the public intended by the interactive
service to be the recipient of the transmission.
(E) For the purposes of this paragraph—
(i) a "licensor" shall include the licensing entity and any other entity under any material
degree of common ownership, management, or control that owns copyrights in sound
recordings; and
(ii) a "performing rights society" is an association or corporation that licenses the public
performance of nondramatic musical works on behalf of the copyright owner, such as the
American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, Broadcast Music, Inc., and
SESAC, Inc.
(4) RIGHTS NOT OTHERWISE LIMITED.—
(A) Except as expressly provided in this section, this section does not limit or impair the
exclusive right to perform a sound recording publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
under section 106(6).
(B) Nothing in this section annuls or limits in any way—
(i) the exclusive right to publicly perform a musical work, including by means of a digital
audio transmission, under section 106(4);
(ii) the exclusive rights in a sound recording or the musical work embodied therein under
sections 106(1), 106(2) and 106(3); or
(iii) any other rights under any other clause of section 106, or remedies available under this
title, as such rights or remedies exist either before or after the date of enactment of the Digital
Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995.
(C) Any limitations in this section on the exclusive right under section 106(6) apply only to
the exclusive right under section 106(6) and not to any other exclusive rights under section 106.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to annul, limit, impair or otherwise affect in any way
the ability of the owner of a copyright in a sound recording to exercise the rights under sections
106(1), 106(2) and 106(3), or to obtain the remedies available under this title pursuant to such
rights, as such rights and remedies exist either before or after the date of enactment of the
Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995.
(e) AUTHORITY FOR NEGOTIATIONS.—
(1) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, in negotiating statutory licenses in
accordance with subsection (f), any copyright owners of sound recordings and any entities
performing sound recordings affected by this section may negotiate and agree upon the royalty
rates and license terms and conditions for the performance of such sound recordings and the
proportionate division of fees paid among copyright owners, and may designate common agents
on a nonexclusive basis to negotiate, agree to, pay, or receive payments.
(2) For licenses granted under section 106(6), other than statutory licenses, such as for
performances by interactive services or performances that exceed the sound recording
performance complement—
(A) copyright owners of sound recordings affected by this section may designate common
agents to act on their behalf to grant licenses and receive and remit royalty payments: Provided,
That each copyright owner shall establish the royalty rates and material license terms and
conditions unilaterally, that is, not in agreement, combination, or concert with other copyright
owners of sound recordings; and
(B) entities performing sound recordings affected by this section may designate common
agents to act on their behalf to obtain licenses and collect and pay royalty fees: Provided, That
[Release Point 118-106]
each entity performing sound recordings shall determine the royalty rates and material license
terms and conditions unilaterally, that is, not in agreement, combination, or concert with other
entities performing sound recordings.
(f) LICENSES FOR CERTAIN NONEXEMPT TRANSMISSIONS.—
(1)(A) Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable rates and terms of royalty
payments for transmissions subject to statutory licensing under subsection (d)(2) during the 5-year
period beginning on January 1 of the second year following the year in which the proceedings are
to be commenced pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 804(b)(3), as the case may be, or
such other period as the parties may agree. The parties to each proceeding shall bear their own
costs.
(B) The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges
shall, subject to paragraph (2), be binding on all copyright owners of sound recordings and entities
performing sound recordings affected by this paragraph during the 5-year period specified in
subparagraph (A), or such other period as the parties may agree. Such rates and terms shall
distinguish among the different types of services then in operation and shall include a minimum
fee for each such type of service, such differences to be based on criteria including the quantity
and nature of the use of sound recordings and the degree to which use of the service may
substitute for or may promote the purchase of phonorecords by consumers. The Copyright Royalty
Judges shall establish rates and terms that most clearly represent the rates and terms that would
have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller. In
determining such rates and terms, the Copyright Royalty Judges—
(i) shall base their decision on economic, competitive, and programming information
presented by the parties, including—
(I) whether use of the service may substitute for or may promote the sales of phonorecords
or otherwise may interfere with or may enhance the sound recording copyright owner's other
streams of revenue from the copyright owner's sound recordings; and
(II) the relative roles of the copyright owner and the transmitting entity in the copyrighted
work and the service made available to the public with respect to relative creative
contribution, technological contribution, capital investment, cost, and risk; and
(ii) may consider the rates and terms for comparable types of audio transmission services and
comparable circumstances under voluntary license agreements.
(C) The procedures under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall also be initiated pursuant to a
petition filed by any sound recording copyright owner or any transmitting entity indicating that a
new type of service on which sound recordings are performed is or is about to become operational,
for the purpose of determining reasonable terms and rates of royalty payments with respect to such
new type of service for the period beginning with the inception of such new type of service and
ending on the date on which the royalty rates and terms for eligible nonsubscription services and
new subscription services, or preexisting subscription services and preexisting satellite digital
audio radio services, as the case may be, most recently determined under subparagraph (A) or (B)
and chapter 8 expire, or such other period as the parties may agree.
(2) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time between 1 or more copyright owners
of sound recordings and 1 or more entities performing sound recordings shall be given effect in
lieu of any decision by the Librarian of Congress or determination by the Copyright Royalty
Judges.
(3)(A) The Copyright Royalty Judges shall also establish requirements by which copyright
owners may receive reasonable notice of the use of their sound recordings under this section, and
under which records of such use shall be kept and made available by entities performing sound
recordings. The notice and recordkeeping rules in effect on the day before the effective date of the
Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004 shall remain in effect unless and until
new regulations are promulgated by the Copyright Royalty Judges. If new regulations are
[Release Point 118-106]
promulgated under this subparagraph, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall take into account the
substance and effect of the rules in effect on the day before the effective date of the Copyright
Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004 and shall, to the extent practicable, avoid significant
disruption of the functions of any designated agent authorized to collect and distribute royalty
fees.
(B) Any person who wishes to perform a sound recording publicly by means of a transmission
eligible for statutory licensing under this subsection may do so without infringing the exclusive
right of the copyright owner of the sound recording—
(i) by complying with such notice requirements as the Copyright Royalty Judges shall
prescribe by regulation and by paying royalty fees in accordance with this subsection; or
(ii) if such royalty fees have not been set, by agreeing to pay such royalty fees as shall be
determined in accordance with this subsection.
(C) Any royalty payments in arrears shall be made on or before the twentieth day of the month
next succeeding the month in which the royalty fees are set.
(4)(A) Notwithstanding section 112(e) and the other provisions of this subsection, the receiving
agent may enter into agreements for the reproduction and performance of sound recordings under
section 112(e) and this section by any 1 or more commercial webcasters or noncommercial
webcasters for a period of not more than 11 years beginning on January 1, 2005, that, once
published in the Federal Register pursuant to subparagraph (B), shall be binding on all copyright
owners of sound recordings and other persons entitled to payment under this section, in lieu of any
determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges. Any such agreement for commercial webcasters
may include provisions for payment of royalties on the basis of a percentage of revenue or
expenses, or both, and include a minimum fee. Any such agreement may include other terms and
conditions, including requirements by which copyright owners may receive notice of the use of
their sound recordings and under which records of such use shall be kept and made available by
commercial webcasters or noncommercial webcasters. The receiving agent shall be under no
obligation to negotiate any such agreement. The receiving agent shall have no obligation to any
copyright owner of sound recordings or any other person entitled to payment under this section in
negotiating any such agreement, and no liability to any copyright owner of sound recordings or
any other person entitled to payment under this section for having entered into such agreement.
(B) The Copyright Office shall cause to be published in the Federal Register any agreement
entered into pursuant to subparagraph (A). Such publication shall include a statement containing
the substance of subparagraph (C). Such agreements shall not be included in the Code of Federal
Regulations. Thereafter, the terms of such agreement shall be available, as an option, to any
commercial webcaster or noncommercial webcaster meeting the eligibility conditions of such
agreement.
(C) Neither subparagraph (A) nor any provisions of any agreement entered into pursuant to
subparagraph (A), including any rate structure, fees, terms, conditions, or notice and
recordkeeping requirements set forth therein, shall be admissible as evidence or otherwise taken
into account in any administrative, judicial, or other government proceeding involving the setting
or adjustment of the royalties payable for the public performance or reproduction in ephemeral
phonorecords or copies of sound recordings, the determination of terms or conditions related
thereto, or the establishment of notice or recordkeeping requirements by the Copyright Royalty
Judges under paragraph (3) or section 112(e)(4). It is the intent of Congress that any royalty rates,
rate structure, definitions, terms, conditions, or notice and recordkeeping requirements, included in
such agreements shall be considered as a compromise motivated by the unique business, economic
and political circumstances of webcasters, copyright owners, and performers rather than as matters
that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller,
or otherwise meet the objectives set forth in section 801(b). This subparagraph shall not apply to
the extent that the receiving agent and a webcaster that is party to an agreement entered into
pursuant to subparagraph (A) expressly authorize the submission of the agreement in a proceeding
under this subsection.
[Release Point 118-106]
(D) Nothing in the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008, the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2009, or
any agreement entered into pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be taken into account by the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in its review of the determination by
the Copyright Royalty Judges of May 1, 2007, of rates and terms for the digital performance of
sound recordings and ephemeral recordings, pursuant to sections 112 and 114.
(E) As used in this paragraph—
(i) the term "noncommercial webcaster" means a webcaster that—
(I) is exempt from taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26
U.S.C. 501);
(II) has applied in good faith to the Internal Revenue Service for exemption from taxation
under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code and has a commercially reasonable
expectation that such exemption shall be granted; or
(III) is operated by a State or possession or any governmental entity or subordinate thereof,
or by the United States or District of Columbia, for exclusively public purposes;
(ii) the term "receiving agent" shall have the meaning given that term in section 261.2 of title
37, Code of Federal Regulations, as published in the Federal Register on July 8, 2002; and
(iii) the term "webcaster" means a person or entity that has obtained a compulsory license
under section 112 or 114 and the implementing regulations therefor.
(F) The authority to make settlements pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall expire at 11:59 p.m.
Eastern time on the 30th day after the date of the enactment of the Webcaster Settlement Act of
2009.
(g) PROCEEDS FROM LICENSING OF TRANSMISSIONS.—
(1) Except in the case of a transmission licensed under a statutory license in accordance with
subsection (f) of this section—
(A) a featured recording artist who performs on a sound recording that has been licensed for a
transmission shall be entitled to receive payments from the copyright owner of the sound
recording in accordance with the terms of the artist's contract; and
(B) a nonfeatured recording artist who performs on a sound recording that has been licensed
for a transmission shall be entitled to receive payments from the copyright owner of the sound
recording in accordance with the terms of the nonfeatured recording artist's applicable contract
or other applicable agreement.
(2) Except as provided for in paragraph (6), a nonprofit collective designated by the Copyright
Royalty Judges to distribute receipts from the licensing of transmissions in accordance with
subsection (f) shall distribute such receipts as follows:
(A) 50 percent of the receipts shall be paid to the copyright owner of the exclusive right
under section 106(6) of this title to publicly perform a sound recording by means of a digital
audio transmission.
(B) 2½ percent of the receipts shall be deposited in an escrow account managed by an
independent administrator jointly appointed by copyright owners of sound recordings and the
American Federation of Musicians (or any successor entity) to be distributed to nonfeatured
musicians (whether or not members of the American Federation of Musicians) who have
performed on sound recordings.
(C) 2½ percent of the receipts shall be deposited in an escrow account managed by an
independent administrator jointly appointed by copyright owners of sound recordings and the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (or any successor entity) to be distributed
to nonfeatured vocalists (whether or not members of the American Federation of Television and
Radio Artists) who have performed on sound recordings.
(D) 45 percent of the receipts shall be paid, on a per sound recording basis, to the recording
artist or artists featured on such sound recording (or the persons conveying rights in the artists'
[Release Point 118-106]
performance in the sound recordings).
(3) A nonprofit collective designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges to distribute receipts
from the licensing of transmissions in accordance with subsection (f) may deduct from any of its
receipts, prior to the distribution of such receipts to any person or entity entitled thereto other than
copyright owners and performers who have elected to receive royalties from another designated
nonprofit collective and have notified such nonprofit collective in writing of such election, the
reasonable costs of such collective incurred after November 1, 1995, in—
(A) the administration of the collection, distribution, and calculation of the royalties;
(B) the settlement of disputes relating to the collection and calculation of the royalties; and
(C) the licensing and enforcement of rights with respect to the making of ephemeral
recordings and performances subject to licensing under section 112 and this section, including
those incurred in participating in negotiations or arbitration proceedings under section 112 and
this section, except that all costs incurred relating to the section 112 ephemeral recordings right
may only be deducted from the royalties received pursuant to section 112.
(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), any nonprofit collective designated to distribute receipts
from the licensing of transmissions in accordance with subsection (f) may deduct from any of its
receipts, prior to the distribution of such receipts, the reasonable costs identified in paragraph (3)
of such collective incurred after November 1, 1995, with respect to such copyright owners and
performers who have entered with such collective a contractual relationship that specifies that
such costs may be deducted from such royalty receipts.
(5) LETTER OF DIRECTION.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—A nonprofit collective designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges to
distribute receipts from the licensing of transmissions in accordance with subsection (f) shall
adopt and reasonably implement a policy that provides, in circumstances determined by the
collective to be appropriate, for acceptance of instructions from a payee identified under
subparagraph (A) or (D) of paragraph (2) to distribute, to a producer, mixer, or sound engineer
who was part of the creative process that created a sound recording, a portion of the payments
to which the payee would otherwise be entitled from the licensing of transmissions of the sound
recording. In this section, such instructions shall be referred to as a "letter of direction".
(B) ACCEPTANCE OF LETTER.—To the extent that a collective described in subparagraph
(A) accepts a letter of direction under that subparagraph, the person entitled to payment
pursuant to the letter of direction shall, during the period in which the letter of direction is in
effect and carried out by the collective, be treated for all purposes as the owner of the right to
receive such payment, and the payee providing the letter of direction to the collective shall be
treated as having no interest in such payment.
(C) AUTHORITY OF COLLECTIVE.—This paragraph shall not be construed in such a
manner so that the collective is not authorized to accept or act upon payment instructions in
circumstances other than those to which this paragraph applies.
(6) SOUND RECORDINGS FIXED BEFORE NOVEMBER 1, 1995.—
(A) PAYMENT ABSENT LETTER OF DIRECTION.—A nonprofit collective designated
by the Copyright Royalty Judges to distribute receipts from the licensing of transmissions in
accordance with subsection (f) (in this paragraph referred to as the "collective") shall adopt and
reasonably implement a policy that provides, in circumstances determined by the collective to
be appropriate, for the deduction of 2 percent of all the receipts that are collected from the
licensing of transmissions of a sound recording fixed before November 1, 1995, but which is
withdrawn from the amount otherwise payable under paragraph (2)(D) to the recording artist or
artists featured on the sound recording (or the persons conveying rights in the artists'
performance in the sound recording), and the distribution of such amount to 1 or more persons
described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, after deduction of costs described in paragraph
(3) or (4), as applicable, if each of the following requirements is met:
[Release Point 118-106]
(i) CERTIFICATION OF ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN A LETTER OF DIRECTION.—The
person described in subparagraph (B) who is to receive the distribution has certified to the
collective, under penalty of perjury, that—
(I) for a period of not less than 120 days, that person made reasonable efforts to contact
the artist payee for such sound recording to request and obtain a letter of direction
instructing the collective to pay to that person a portion of the royalties payable to the
featured recording artist or artists; and
(II) during the period beginning on the date on which that person began the reasonable
efforts described in subclause (I) and ending on the date of that person's certification to the
collective, the artist payee did not affirm or deny in writing the request for a letter of
direction.
(ii) COLLECTIVE ATTEMPT TO CONTACT ARTIST.—After receipt of the
certification described in clause (i) and for a period of not less than 120 days before the first
distribution by the collective to the person described in subparagraph (B), the collective
attempts, in a reasonable manner as determined by the collective, to notify the artist payee of
the certification made by the person described in subparagraph (B).
(iii) NO OBJECTION RECEIVED.—The artist payee does not, as of the date that was 10
business days before the date on which the first distribution is made, submit to the collective
in writing an objection to the distribution.
(B) ELIGIBILITY FOR PAYMENT.—A person shall be eligible for payment under
subparagraph (A) if the person—
(i) is a producer, mixer, or sound engineer of the sound recording;
(ii) has entered into a written contract with a record company involved in the creation or
lawful exploitation of the sound recording, or with the recording artist or artists featured on
the sound recording (or the persons conveying rights in the artists' performance in the sound
recording), under which the person seeking payment is entitled to participate in royalty
payments that are based on the exploitation of the sound recording and are payable from
royalties otherwise payable to the recording artist or artists featured on the sound recording
(or the persons conveying rights in the artists' performance in the sound recording);
(iii) made a creative contribution to the creation of the sound recording; and
(iv) submits to the collective—
(I) a written certification stating, under penalty of perjury, that the person meets the
requirements in clauses (i) through (iii); and
(II) a true copy of the contract described in clause (ii).
(C) MULTIPLE CERTIFICATIONS.—Subject to subparagraph (D), in a case in which more
than 1 person described in subparagraph (B) has met the requirements for a distribution under
subparagraph (A) with respect to a sound recording as of the date that is 10 business days before
the date on which the distribution is made, the collective shall divide the 2 percent distribution
equally among all such persons.
(D) OBJECTION TO PAYMENT.—Not later than 10 business days after the date on which
the collective receives from the artist payee a written objection to a distribution made pursuant
to subparagraph (A), the collective shall cease making any further payment relating to such
distribution. In any case in which the collective has made 1 or more distributions pursuant to
subparagraph (A) to a person described in subparagraph (B) before the date that is 10 business
days after the date on which the collective receives from the artist payee an objection to such
distribution, the objection shall not affect that person's entitlement to any distribution made
before the collective ceases such distribution under this subparagraph.
(E) OWNERSHIP OF THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS.—To the extent that the
collective determines that a distribution will be made under subparagraph (A) to a person
described in subparagraph (B), such person shall, during the period covered by such
[Release Point 118-106]
distribution, be treated for all purposes as the owner of the right to receive such payments, and
the artist payee to whom such payments would otherwise be payable shall be treated as having
no interest in such payments.
(F) ARTIST PAYEE DEFINED.—In this paragraph, the term "artist payee" means a person,
other than a person described in subparagraph (B), who owns the right to receive all or part of
the receipts payable under paragraph (2)(D) with respect to a sound recording. In a case in
which there are multiple artist payees with respect to a sound recording, an objection by 1 such
payee shall apply only to that payee's share of the receipts payable under paragraph (2)(D), and
shall not preclude payment under subparagraph (A) from the share of an artist payee that does
not so object.
(7) PREEMPTION OF STATE PROPERTY LAWS.—The holding and distribution of receipts
under section 112 and this section by a nonprofit collective designated by the Copyright Royalty
Judges in accordance with this subsection and regulations adopted by the Copyright Royalty
Judges, or by an independent administrator pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section
114(g)(2), shall supersede and preempt any State law (including common law) concerning
escheatment or abandoned property, or any analogous provision, that might otherwise apply.
(h) LICENSING TO AFFILIATES.—
(1) If the copyright owner of a sound recording licenses an affiliated entity the right to publicly
perform a sound recording by means of a digital audio transmission under section 106(6), the
copyright owner shall make the licensed sound recording available under section 106(6) on no less
favorable terms and conditions to all bona fide entities that offer similar services, except that, if
there are material differences in the scope of the requested license with respect to the type of
service, the particular sound recordings licensed, the frequency of use, the number of subscribers
served, or the duration, then the copyright owner may establish different terms and conditions for
such other services.
(2) The limitation set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply in the case where
the copyright owner of a sound recording licenses—
(A) an interactive service; or
(B) an entity to perform publicly up to 45 seconds of the sound recording and the sole
purpose of the performance is to promote the distribution or performance of that sound
recording.
[(i) Repealed. Pub. L. 115–264, title I, §103(b), Oct. 11, 2018, 132 Stat. 3724.]
(j) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1) An "affiliated entity" is an entity engaging in digital audio transmissions covered by section
106(6), other than an interactive service, in which the licensor has any direct or indirect
partnership or any ownership interest amounting to 5 percent or more of the outstanding voting or
non-voting stock.
(2) An "archived program" is a predetermined program that is available repeatedly on the
demand of the transmission recipient and that is performed in the same order from the beginning,
except that an archived program shall not include a recorded event or broadcast transmission that
makes no more than an incidental use of sound recordings, as long as such recorded event or
broadcast transmission does not contain an entire sound recording or feature a particular sound
recording.
(3) A "broadcast" transmission is a transmission made by a terrestrial broadcast station licensed
as such by the Federal Communications Commission.
(4) A "continuous program" is a predetermined program that is continuously performed in the
same order and that is accessed at a point in the program that is beyond the control of the
transmission recipient.
(5) A "digital audio transmission" is a digital transmission as defined in section 101, that
embodies the transmission of a sound recording. This term does not include the transmission of
[Release Point 118-106]
any audiovisual work.
(6) An "eligible nonsubscription transmission" is a noninteractive nonsubscription digital audio
transmission not exempt under subsection (d)(1) that is made as part of a service that provides
audio programming consisting, in whole or in part, of performances of sound recordings, including
retransmissions of broadcast transmissions, if the primary purpose of the service is to provide to
the public such audio or other entertainment programming, and the primary purpose of the service
is not to sell, advertise, or promote particular products or services other than sound recordings,
live concerts, or other music-related events.
(7) An "interactive service" is one that enables a member of the public to receive a transmission
of a program specially created for the recipient, or on request, a transmission of a particular sound
recording, whether or not as part of a program, which is selected by or on behalf of the recipient.
The ability of individuals to request that particular sound recordings be performed for reception by
the public at large, or in the case of a subscription service, by all subscribers of the service, does
not make a service interactive, if the programming on each channel of the service does not
substantially consist of sound recordings that are performed within 1 hour of the request or at a
time designated by either the transmitting entity or the individual making such request. If an entity
offers both interactive and noninteractive services (either concurrently or at different times), the
noninteractive component shall not be treated as part of an interactive service.
(8) A "new subscription service" is a service that performs sound recordings by means of
noninteractive subscription digital audio transmissions and that is not a preexisting subscription
service or a preexisting satellite digital audio radio service.
(9) A "nonsubscription" transmission is any transmission that is not a subscription transmission.
(10) A "preexisting satellite digital audio radio service" is a subscription satellite digital audio
radio service provided pursuant to a satellite digital audio radio service license issued by the
Federal Communications Commission on or before July 31, 1998, and any renewal of such license
to the extent of the scope of the original license, and may include a limited number of sample
channels representative of the subscription service that are made available on a nonsubscription
basis in order to promote the subscription service.
(11) A "preexisting subscription service" is a service that performs sound recordings by means
of noninteractive audio-only subscription digital audio transmissions, which was in existence and
was making such transmissions to the public for a fee on or before July 31, 1998, and may include
a limited number of sample channels representative of the subscription service that are made
available on a nonsubscription basis in order to promote the subscription service.
(12) A "retransmission" is a further transmission of an initial transmission, and includes any
further retransmission of the same transmission. Except as provided in this section, a transmission
qualifies as a "retransmission" only if it is simultaneous with the initial transmission. Nothing in
this definition shall be construed to exempt a transmission that fails to satisfy a separate element
required to qualify for an exemption under section 114(d)(1).
(13) The "sound recording performance complement" is the transmission during any 3-hour
period, on a particular channel used by a transmitting entity, of no more than—
(A) 3 different selections of sound recordings from any one phonorecord lawfully distributed
for public performance or sale in the United States, if no more than 2 such selections are
transmitted consecutively; or
(B) 4 different selections of sound recordings—
(i) by the same featured recording artist; or
(ii) from any set or compilation of phonorecords lawfully distributed together as a unit for
public performance or sale in the United States,
if no more than three such selections are transmitted consecutively:
Provided, That the transmission of selections in excess of the numerical limits provided for in
clauses (A) and (B) from multiple phonorecords shall nonetheless qualify as a sound recording
performance complement if the programming of the multiple phonorecords was not willfully
[Release Point 118-106]
intended to avoid the numerical limitations prescribed in such clauses.
(14) A "subscription" transmission is a transmission that is controlled and limited to particular
recipients, and for which consideration is required to be paid or otherwise given by or on behalf of
the recipient to receive the transmission or a package of transmissions including the transmission.
(15) A "transmission" is either an initial transmission or a retransmission.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Subsection (a) of Section 114 specified that the exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound
recording are limited to the rights to reproduce the sound recording in copies or phonorecords, to prepare
derivative works based on the copyrighted sound recording, and to distribute copies or phonorecords of the
sound recording to the public. Subsection (a) states explicitly that the owner's rights "do not include any right
of performance under section 106(4)." The Committee considered at length the arguments in favor of
establishing a limited performance right, in the form of a compulsory license, for copyrighted sound
recordings, but concluded that the problem requires further study. It therefore added a new subsection (d) to
the bill requiring the Register of Copyrights to submit to Congress, on January 3, 1978, "a report setting forth
recommendations as to whether this section should be amended to provide for performers and copyright
owners * * * any performance rights" in copyrighted sound recordings. Under the new subsection, the report
"should describe the status of such rights in foreign countries, the views of major interested parties, and
specific legislative or other recommendations, if any."
Subsection (b) of section 114 makes clear that statutory protection for sound recordings extends only to the
particular sounds of which the recording consists, and would not prevent a separate recording of another
performance in which those sounds are imitated. Thus, infringement takes place whenever all or any
substantial portion of the actual sounds that go to make up a copyrighted sound recording are reproduced in
phonorecords by repressing, transcribing, recapturing off the air, or any other method, or by reproducing them
in the soundtrack or audio portion of a motion picture or other audiovisual work. Mere imitation of a recorded
performance would not constitute a copyright infringement even where one performer deliberately sets out to
simulate another's performance as exactly as possible.
Under section 114, the exclusive right of owner of copyright in a sound recording to prepare derivative
works based on the copyrighted sound recording is recognized. However, in view of the expressed intention
not to give exclusive rights against imitative or simulated performances and recordings, the Committee
adopted an amendment to make clear the scope of rights under section 106(2) in this context. Section 114(b)
provides that the "exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause (2) of section
106 is limited to the right to prepare a derivative work in which the actual sounds fixed in the sound recording
are rearranged, remixed, or otherwise altered in sequence or quality."
Another amendment deals with the use of copyrighted sound recordings "included in educational television
and radio programs * * * distributed or transmitted by or through public broadcasting entities." This use of
recordings is permissible without authorization from the owner of copyright in the sound recording, as long as
"copies or phonorecords of said programs are not commercially distributed by or through public broadcasting
entities to the general public."
During the 1975 hearings, the Register of Copyrights expressed some concern that an invaluable segment of
this country's musical heritage—in the form of sound recordings—had become inaccessible to musicologists
and to others for scholarly purposes. Several of the major recording companies have responded to the
Register's concern by granting blanket licenses to the Library of Congress to permit it to make single copy
duplications of sound recordings maintained in the Library's archives for research purposes. Moreover, steps
are being taken to determine the feasibility of additional licensing arrangements as a means of satisfying the
needs of key regional music libraries across the country. The Register has agreed to report to Congress if
further legislative consideration should be undertaken.
[Release Point 118-106]
Section 114(c) states explicitly that nothing in the provisions of section 114 should be construed to "limit or
impair the exclusive right to perform publicly, by means of a phonorecord, any of the works specified by
section 106(4)." This principle is already implicit in the bill, but it is restated to avoid the danger of confusion
between rights in a sound recording and rights in the musical composition or other work embodied in the
recording.

"(iii) a nonsubscription broadcast transmission;".
Subsec. (d)(2). Pub. L. 105–304, §405(a)(1)(B), amended heading and text of par. (2) generally. Prior to

or other governmental proceeding to set or adjust the royalties payable to musical work copyright owners

FINDINGS RELATING TO PUB. L. 107–321
Pub. L. 107–321, §2, Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2780, provided that: "Congress finds the following:
"(1) Some small webcasters who did not participate in the copyright arbitration royalty panel
proceeding leading to the July 8, 2002 order of the Librarian of Congress establishing rates and terms for
certain digital performances and ephemeral reproductions of sound recordings, as provided in part 261 of
the Code of Federal Regulations (published in the Federal Register on July 8, 2002) (referred to in this
section as 'small webcasters'), have expressed reservations about the fee structure set forth in such order,
and have expressed their desire for a fee based on a percentage of revenue.
"(2) Congress has strongly encouraged representatives of copyright owners of sound recordings and
representatives of the small webcasters to engage in negotiations to arrive at an agreement that would
include a fee based on a percentage of revenue.
"(3) The representatives have arrived at an agreement that they can accept in the extraordinary and
unique circumstances here presented, specifically as to the small webcasters, their belief in their inability to
pay the fees due pursuant to the July 8 order, and as to the copyright owners of sound recordings and
performers, the strong encouragement of Congress to reach an accommodation with the small webcasters
on an expedited basis.
"(4) The representatives have indicated that they do not believe the agreement provides for or in any
way approximates fair or reasonable royalty rates and terms, or rates and terms that would have been
negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller.
"(5) Congress has made no determination as to whether the agreement provides for or in any way
approximates fair or reasonable fees and terms, or rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the
marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller.
"(6) Congress likewise has made no determination as to whether the July 8 order is reasonable or
arbitrary, and nothing in this Act [amending this section and enacting provisions set out as notes under this
section and section 101 of this title] shall be taken into account by the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit in its review of such order.
"(7) It is, nevertheless, in the public interest for the parties to be able to enter into such an agreement
without fear of liability for deviating from the fees and terms of the July 8 order, if it is clear that the
agreement will not be admissible as evidence or otherwise taken into account in any government
proceeding involving the setting or adjustment of the royalties payable to copyright owners of sound
recordings for the public performance or reproduction in ephemeral phonorecords or copies of such works,
the determination of terms or conditions related thereto, or the establishment of notice or recordkeeping
requirements."
Pub. L. 107–321, §5(a), Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2783, provided that: "Congress finds that—
"(1) in the case of royalty payments from the licensing of digital transmissions of sound recordings
under subsection (f) of section 114 of title 17, United States Code, the parties have voluntarily negotiated
arrangements under which payments shall be made directly to featured recording artists and the
administrators of the accounts provided in subsection (g)(2) of that section;
"(2) such voluntarily negotiated payment arrangements have been codified in regulations issued by the
Librarian of Congress, currently found in section 261.4 of title 37, Code of Federal Regulations, as
published in the Federal Register on July 8, 2002;
"(3) other regulations issued by the Librarian of Congress were inconsistent with the voluntarily
negotiated arrangements by such parties concerning the deductibility of certain costs incurred for licensing
and arbitration, and Congress is therefore restoring those terms as originally negotiated among the parties;
and
[Release Point 118-106]
"(4) in light of the special circumstances described in this subsection, the uncertainty created by the
regulations issued by the Librarian of Congress, and the fact that all of the interested parties have reached
agreement, the voluntarily negotiated arrangements agreed to among the parties are being codified."
SUSPENSION OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS
Pub. L. 107–321, §3, Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2781, provided that:
"(a) NONCOMMERCIAL WEBCASTERS.—
"(1) IN GENERAL.—The payments to be made by noncommercial webcasters for the digital
performance of sound recordings under section 114 of title 17, United States Code, and the making of
ephemeral phonorecords under section 112 of title 17, United States Code, during the period beginning on
October 28, 1998, and ending on May 31, 2003, which have not already been paid, shall not be due until
June 20, 2003.
"(2) DEFINITION.—In this subsection, the term 'noncommercial webcaster' has the meaning given
that term in section 114(f)(5)(E)(i) [now 114(f)(4)(E)(i)] of title 17, United States Code, as added by section
4 of this Act.
"(b) SMALL COMMERCIAL WEBCASTERS.—
"(1) IN GENERAL.—The receiving agent may, in a writing signed by an authorized representative
thereof, delay the obligation of any 1 or more small commercial webcasters to make payments pursuant to
sections 112 and 114 of title 17, United States Code, for a period determined by such entity to allow
negotiations as permitted in section 4 of this Act [amending this section], except that any such period shall
end no later than December 15, 2002. The duration and terms of any such delay shall be as set forth in such
writing.
"(2) DEFINITIONS.—In this subsection—
"(A) the term 'webcaster' has the meaning given that term in section 114(f)(5)(E)(iii) [now
114(f)(4)(E)(iii)] of title 17, United States Code, as added by section 4 of this Act; and
"(B) the term 'receiving agent' shall have the meaning given that term in section 261.2 of title 37,
Code of Federal Regulations, as published in the Federal Register on July 8, 2002."
REPORT TO CONGRESS
Pub. L. 107–321, §6, Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2785, required that, by not later than June 1, 2004, the
Comptroller General, in consultation with the Register of Copyrights, was to conduct and submit to Congress
a study concerning the economic arrangements among small commercial webcasters covered by agreements
entered into pursuant to subsec. (f) of this section and third parties, and the effect of those arrangements on
royalty fees payable on a percentage of revenue or expense basis.

§115. Scope of exclusive rights in nondramatic musical works: Compulsory
license for making and distributing phonorecords
In the case of nondramatic musical works, the exclusive rights provided by clauses (1) and (3) of
section 106, to make and to distribute phonorecords of such works, are subject to compulsory
licensing under the conditions specified by this section.
(a) AVAILABILITY AND SCOPE OF COMPULSORY LICENSE IN GENERAL.—
(1) ELIGIBILITY FOR COMPULSORY LICENSE.—
(A) CONDITIONS FOR COMPULSORY LICENSE.—A person may by complying with the
provisions of this section obtain a compulsory license to make and distribute phonorecords of a
nondramatic musical work, including by means of digital phonorecord delivery. A person may
obtain a compulsory license only if the primary purpose in making phonorecords of the musical
work is to distribute them to the public for private use, including by means of digital
phonorecord delivery, and—
(i) phonorecords of such musical work have previously been distributed to the public in the
United States under the authority of the copyright owner of the work, including by means of
digital phonorecord delivery; or
(ii) in the case of a digital music provider seeking to make and distribute digital
[Release Point 118-106]
phonorecord deliveries of a sound recording embodying a musical work under a compulsory
license for which clause (i) does not apply—
(I) the first fixation of such sound recording was made under the authority of the musical
work copyright owner, and the sound recording copyright owner has the authority of the
musical work copyright owner to make and distribute digital phonorecord deliveries
embodying such work to the public in the United States; and
(II) the sound recording copyright owner, or the authorized distributor of the sound
recording copyright owner, has authorized the digital music provider to make and
distribute digital phonorecord deliveries of the sound recording to the public in the United
States.
(B) DUPLICATION OF SOUND RECORDING.—A person may not obtain a compulsory
license for the use of the work in the making of phonorecords duplicating a sound recording
fixed by another, including by means of digital phonorecord delivery, unless—
(i) such sound recording was fixed lawfully; and
(ii) the making of the phonorecords was authorized by the owner of the copyright in the
sound recording or, if the sound recording was fixed before February 15, 1972, by any person
who fixed the sound recording pursuant to an express license from the owner of the copyright
in the musical work or pursuant to a valid compulsory license for use of such work in a sound
recording.
(2) MUSICAL ARRANGEMENT.—A compulsory license includes the privilege of making a
musical arrangement of the work to the extent necessary to conform it to the style or manner of
interpretation of the performance involved, but the arrangement shall not change the basic melody
or fundamental character of the work, and shall not be subject to protection as a derivative work
under this title, except with the express consent of the copyright owner.
(b) PROCEDURES TO OBTAIN A COMPULSORY LICENSE.—
(1) PHONORECORDS OTHER THAN DIGITAL PHONORECORD DELIVERIES.—A
person who seeks to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a) to make and distribute
phonorecords of a musical work other than by means of digital phonorecord delivery shall, before,
or not later than 30 calendar days after, making, and before distributing, any phonorecord of the
work, serve notice of intention to do so on the copyright owner. If the registration or other public
records of the Copyright Office do not identify the copyright owner and include an address at
which notice can be served, it shall be sufficient to file the notice of intention with the Copyright
Office. The notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner of service, with requirements that
the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
(2) DIGITAL PHONORECORD DELIVERIES.—A person who seeks to obtain a compulsory
license under subsection (a) to make and distribute phonorecords of a musical work by means of
digital phonorecord delivery—
(A) prior to the license availability date, shall, before, or not later than 30 calendar days after,
first making any such digital phonorecord delivery, serve a notice of intention to do so on the
copyright owner (but may not file the notice with the Copyright Office, even if the public
records of the Office do not identify the owner or the owner's address), and such notice shall
comply, in form, content, and manner of service, with requirements that the Register of
Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation; or
(B) on or after the license availability date, shall, before making any such digital phonorecord
delivery, follow the procedure described in subsection (d)(2), except as provided in paragraph
(3).
(3) RECORD COMPANY INDIVIDUAL DOWNLOAD LICENSES.—Notwithstanding
paragraph (2)(B), a record company may, on or after the license availability date, obtain an
individual download license in accordance with the notice requirements described in paragraph
[Release Point 118-106]
(2)(A) (except for the requirement that notice occur prior to the license availability date). A record
company that obtains an individual download license as permitted under this paragraph shall
provide statements of account and pay royalties as provided in subsection (c)(2)(I).
(4) FAILURE TO OBTAIN LICENSE.—
(A) PHONORECORDS OTHER THAN DIGITAL PHONORECORD DELIVERIES.—In
the case of phonorecords made and distributed other than by means of digital phonorecord
delivery, the failure to serve or file the notice of intention required by paragraph (1) forecloses
the possibility of a compulsory license under paragraph (1). In the absence of a voluntary
license, the failure to obtain a compulsory license renders the making and distribution of
phonorecords actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and subject to the remedies
provided by sections 502 through 506.
(B) DIGITAL PHONORECORD DELIVERIES.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—In the case of phonorecords made and distributed by means of digital
phonorecord delivery:
(I) The failure to serve the notice of intention required by paragraph (2)(A) or paragraph
(3), as applicable, forecloses the possibility of a compulsory license under such paragraph.
(II) The failure to comply with paragraph (2)(B) forecloses the possibility of a blanket
license for a period of 3 years after the last calendar day on which the notice of license was
required to be submitted to the mechanical licensing collective under such paragraph.
(ii) EFFECT OF FAILURE.—In either case described in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i),
in the absence of a voluntary license, the failure to obtain a compulsory license renders the
making and distribution of phonorecords by means of digital phonorecord delivery actionable
as acts of infringement under section 501 and subject to the remedies provided by sections
502 through 506.
(c) GENERAL CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO COMPULSORY LICENSE.—
(1) ROYALTY PAYABLE UNDER COMPULSORY LICENSE.—
(A) IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENT.—To be entitled to receive royalties under a
compulsory license obtained under subsection (b)(1) the copyright owner must be identified in
the registration or other public records of the Copyright Office. The owner is entitled to
royalties for phonorecords made and distributed after being so identified, but is not entitled to
recover for any phonorecords previously made and distributed.
(B) ROYALTY FOR PHONORECORDS OTHER THAN DIGITAL PHONORECORD
DELIVERIES.—Except as provided by subparagraph (A), for every phonorecord made and
distributed under a compulsory license under subsection (a) other than by means of digital
phonorecord delivery, with respect to each work embodied in the phonorecord, the royalty shall
be the royalty prescribed under subparagraphs (D) through (F), paragraph (2)(A), and chapter 8.
For purposes of this subparagraph, a phonorecord is considered "distributed" if the person
exercising the compulsory license has voluntarily and permanently parted with its possession.
(C) ROYALTY FOR DIGITAL PHONORECORD DELIVERIES.—For every digital
phonorecord delivery of a musical work made under a compulsory license under this section,
the royalty payable shall be the royalty prescribed under subparagraphs (D) through (F),
paragraph (2)(A), and chapter 8.
(D) AUTHORITY TO NEGOTIATE.—Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws,
any copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain a
compulsory license under subsection (a) may negotiate and agree upon the terms and rates of
royalty payments under this section and the proportionate division of fees paid among copyright
owners, and may designate common agents on a nonexclusive basis to negotiate, agree to, pay
or receive such royalty payments. Such authority to negotiate the terms and rates of royalty
payments includes, but is not limited to, the authority to negotiate the year during which the
royalty rates prescribed under this subparagraph, subparagraphs (E) and (F), paragraph (2)(A),
and chapter 8 shall next be determined.
[Release Point 118-106]
(E) DETERMINATION OF REASONABLE RATES AND TERMS.—Proceedings under
chapter 8 shall determine reasonable rates and terms of royalty payments for the activities
specified by this section during the period beginning with the effective date of such rates and
terms, but not earlier than January 1 of the second year following the year in which the petition
requesting the proceeding is filed, and ending on the effective date of successor rates and terms,
or such other period as the parties may agree. Any copyright owners of nondramatic musical
works and any persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a) may submit
to the Copyright Royalty Judges licenses covering such activities. The parties to each
proceeding shall bear their own costs.
(F) SCHEDULE OF REASONABLE RATES.—The schedule of reasonable rates and terms
determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges shall, subject to paragraph (2)(A), be binding on
all copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and persons entitled to obtain a compulsory
license under subsection (a) during the period specified in subparagraph (E), such other period
as may be determined pursuant to subparagraphs (D) and (E), or such other period as the parties
may agree. The Copyright Royalty Judges shall establish rates and terms that most clearly
represent the rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a
willing buyer and a willing seller. In determining such rates and terms for digital phonorecord
deliveries, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall base their decision on economic, competitive,
and programming information presented by the parties, including—
(i) whether use of the compulsory licensee's service may substitute for or may promote the
sales of phonorecords or otherwise may interfere with or may enhance the musical work
copyright owner's other streams of revenue from its musical works; and

obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a) shall be given effect in lieu of any
determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges. Subject to clause (ii), the royalty rates
determined pursuant to subparagraphs (E) and (F) of paragraph (1) shall be given effect as to
digital phonorecord deliveries in lieu of any contrary royalty rates specified in a contract
pursuant to which a recording artist who is the author of a nondramatic musical work grants a
license under that person's exclusive rights in the musical work under paragraphs (1) and (3)

contract covered by the reduced rates, except if a contract entered into on or before June
22, 1995, is modified thereafter for the purpose of increasing the number of musical works
within the scope of the contract, any contrary royalty rates specified in the contract shall be
given effect in lieu of royalty rates determined pursuant to subparagraphs (E) and (F) of
paragraph (1) for the number of musical works within the scope of the contract as of June

recording artist who performs on the sound recording, and related information, including
information concerning the underlying musical work and its writer.
(C) INFRINGEMENT REMEDIES.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—A digital phonorecord delivery of a sound recording is actionable as
an act of infringement under section 501, and is fully subject to the remedies provided by
sections 502 through 506, unless—
(I) the digital phonorecord delivery has been authorized by the sound recording
copyright owner; and
(II) the entity making the digital phonorecord delivery has obtained a compulsory
license under subsection (a) or has otherwise been authorized by the musical work
copyright owner, or by a record company pursuant to an individual download license, to
make and distribute phonorecords of each musical work embodied in the sound recording
by means of digital phonorecord delivery.
(ii) OTHER REMEDIES.—Any cause of action under this subparagraph shall be in
addition to those available to the owner of the copyright in the nondramatic musical work
under subparagraph (J) and section 106(4) and the owner of the copyright in the sound
recording under section 106(6).
(D) LIABILITY OF SOUND RECORDING OWNERS.—The liability of the copyright
owner of a sound recording for infringement of the copyright in a nondramatic musical work
embodied in the sound recording shall be determined in accordance with applicable law, except
that the owner of a copyright in a sound recording shall not be liable for a digital phonorecord
delivery by a third party if the owner of the copyright in the sound recording does not license
the distribution of a phonorecord of the nondramatic musical work.
(E) RECORDING DEVICES AND MEDIA.—Nothing in section 1008 shall be construed to
prevent the exercise of the rights and remedies allowed by this paragraph, subparagraph (J), and
chapter 5 in the event of a digital phonorecord delivery, except that no action alleging
infringement of copyright may be brought under this title against a manufacturer, importer or
distributor of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog
recording device, or an analog recording medium, or against a consumer, based on the actions
described in such section.
(F) PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS.—Nothing in this section annuls or limits—
(i) the exclusive right to publicly perform a sound recording or the musical work embodied
therein, including by means of a digital transmission, under paragraphs (4) and (6) of section
106;
(ii) except for compulsory licensing under the conditions specified by this section, the
exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the sound recording and the musical work
embodied therein under paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 106, including by means of a digital
phonorecord delivery; or
(iii) any other rights under any other provision of section 106, or remedies available under
this title, as such rights or remedies exist before, on, or after the date of enactment of the
Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995.
(G) EXEMPT TRANSMISSIONS AND RETRANSMISSIONS.—The provisions of this
section concerning digital phonorecord deliveries shall not apply to any exempt transmissions
[Release Point 118-106]
or retransmissions under section 114(d)(1). The exemptions created in section 114(d)(1) do not
expand or reduce the rights of copyright owners under paragraphs (1) through (5) of section 106
with respect to such transmissions and retransmissions.
(H) DISTRIBUTION BY RENTAL, LEASE, OR LENDING.—A compulsory license
obtained under subsection (b)(1) to make and distribute phonorecords includes the right of the
maker of such a phonorecord to distribute or authorize distribution of such phonorecord, other
than by means of a digital phonorecord delivery, by rental, lease, or lending (or by acts or
practices in the nature of rental, lease, or lending). With respect to each nondramatic musical
work embodied in the phonorecord, the royalty shall be a proportion of the revenue received by
the compulsory licensee from every such act of distribution of the phonorecord under this
clause equal to the proportion of the revenue received by the compulsory licensee from
distribution of the phonorecord under subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii)(II) that is payable by a
compulsory licensee under that clause and under chapter 8. The Register of Copyrights shall
issue regulations to carry out the purpose of this subparagraph.
(I) PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES AND STATEMENTS OF ACCOUNT.—Except as
provided in paragraphs (4)(A)(i) and (10)(B) of subsection (d), royalty payments shall be made
on or before the twentieth day of each month and shall include all royalties for the month next
preceding. Each monthly payment shall be made under oath and shall comply with requirements
that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation. The Register shall also prescribe
regulations under which detailed cumulative annual statements of account, certified by a
certified public accountant, shall be filed for every compulsory license under subsection (a).
The regulations covering both the monthly and the annual statements of account shall prescribe
the form, content, and manner of certification with respect to the number of records made and
the number of records distributed.
(J) NOTICE OF DEFAULT AND TERMINATION OF COMPULSORY LICENSE.—In the
case of a license obtained under paragraph (1), (2)(A), or (3) of subsection (b), if the copyright
owner does not receive the monthly payment and the monthly and annual statements of account
when due, the owner may give written notice to the licensee that, unless the default is remedied
not later than 30 days after the date on which the notice is sent, the compulsory license will be
automatically terminated. Such termination renders either the making or the distribution, or
both, of all phonorecords for which the royalty has not been paid, actionable as acts of
infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502
through 506. In the case of a license obtained under subsection (b)(2)(B), license authority
under the compulsory license may be terminated as provided in subsection (d)(4)(E).

whether an underpayment or overpayment of royalties was made by the mechanical
[Release Point 118-106]
licensing collective to each auditing copyright owner, except that, before providing a final
audit report to any such copyright owner, the qualified auditor shall provide a tentative
draft of the report to the mechanical licensing collective and allow the mechanical
licensing collective a reasonable opportunity to respond to the findings, including by
clarifying issues and correcting factual errors.
(VI) The auditing copyright owner or owners shall bear the cost of the audit. In case of
an underpayment to any copyright owner, the mechanical licensing collective shall pay the
amounts of any such underpayment to such auditing copyright owner, as appropriate. In

the monthly reporting period.
(ii) DATA TO BE REPORTED.—In reporting usage of musical works to the mechanical
licensing collective, a digital music provider shall provide usage data for musical works used
under the blanket license and usage data for musical works used in covered activities under
voluntary licenses and individual download licenses. In the report of usage, the digital music
provider shall—
(I) with respect to each sound recording embodying a musical work—
(aa) provide identifying information for the sound recording, including sound
recording name, featured artist, and, to the extent acquired by the digital music provider
in connection with its use of sound recordings of musical works to engage in covered
activities, including pursuant to subparagraph (B), sound recording copyright owner,
producer, international standard recording code, and other information commonly used
[Release Point 118-106]

covered activities under a blanket license; and
(II) regarding adjustments to reports of usage by digital music providers, including
mechanisms to account for overpayment and underpayment of royalties in prior periods.
(B) COLLECTION OF SOUND RECORDING INFORMATION.—A digital music provider
shall engage in good-faith, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from sound recording
copyright owners and other licensors of sound recordings made available through the service of

provider not more frequently than once in any 3-calendar-year period to cover a
[Release Point 118-106]
verification period of not more than the 3 full calendar years preceding the date of
commencement of the audit, and such audit may not audit records for any such 3-year
verification period more than once.
(II) The audit shall be conducted by a qualified auditor, who shall perform the audit
during the ordinary course of business by examining the books, records, and data of the
digital music provider, according to generally accepted auditing standards and subject to
applicable confidentiality requirements prescribed by the Register of Copyrights under
paragraph (12)(C).
(III) The digital music provider shall make such books, records, and data available to the
qualified auditor and respond to reasonable requests for relevant information, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide access to relevant information maintained with
respect to a digital music provider by third parties.
(IV) To commence the audit, the mechanical licensing collective shall file with the
Copyright Office a notice of intent to conduct an audit of the digital music provider,
identifying the period of time to be audited, and shall simultaneously deliver a copy of
such notice to the digital music provider. The Register of Copyrights shall cause the notice
of audit to be published in the Federal Register not later than 45 calendar days after the
date on which notice is received.
(V) The qualified auditor shall determine the accuracy of royalty payments, including
whether an underpayment or overpayment of royalties was made by the digital music
provider to the mechanical licensing collective, except that, before providing a final audit
report to the mechanical licensing collective, the qualified auditor shall provide a tentative
draft of the report to the digital music provider and allow the digital music provider a
reasonable opportunity to respond to the findings, including by clarifying issues and
correcting factual errors.
(VI) The mechanical licensing collective shall pay the cost of the audit, unless the
qualified auditor determines that there was an underpayment by the digital music provider
of not less than 10 percent, in which case the digital music provider shall bear the
reasonable costs of the audit, in addition to paying the amount of any underpayment to the
mechanical licensing collective. In case of an overpayment by the digital music provider,
the mechanical licensing collective shall provide a credit to the account of the digital music
provider.
(VII) A digital music provider may not assert section 507 or any other Federal or State
statute of limitations, doctrine of laches or estoppel, or similar provision as a defense to a
legal action arising from an audit under this subparagraph if such legal action is
commenced not more than 6 years after the commencement of the audit that is the basis for
such action.
(ii) ALTERNATIVE VERIFICATION PROCEDURES.—Nothing in this subparagraph
shall preclude the mechanical licensing collective and a digital music provider from agreeing
to audit procedures different from those described in this subparagraph, except that a notice
of the audit shall be provided to and published by the Copyright Office as described in clause
(i)(IV).
(E) DEFAULT UNDER BLANKET LICENSE.—
(i) CONDITIONS OF DEFAULT.—A digital music provider shall be in default under a
blanket license if the digital music provider—
(I) fails to provide 1 or more monthly reports of usage to the mechanical licensing
collective when due;
(II) fails to make a monthly royalty or late fee payment to the mechanical licensing
collective when due, in all or material part;
(III) provides 1 or more monthly reports of usage to the mechanical licensing collective
that, on the whole, is or are materially deficient as a result of inaccurate, missing, or
[Release Point 118-106]
unreadable data, where the correct data was available to the digital music provider and
required to be reported under this section and applicable regulations;
(IV) fails to pay the administrative assessment as required under this subsection and
applicable regulations; or
(V) after being provided written notice by the mechanical licensing collective, refuses to
comply with any other material term or condition of the blanket license under this section
for a period of not less than 60 calendar days.
(ii) NOTICE OF DEFAULT AND TERMINATION.—In case of a default by a digital
music provider, the mechanical licensing collective may proceed to terminate the blanket
license of the digital music provider as follows:
(I) The mechanical licensing collective shall provide written notice to the digital music
provider describing with reasonable particularity the default and advising that unless such
default is cured not later than 60 calendar days after the date of the notice, the blanket
license will automatically terminate at the end of that period.
(II) If the digital music provider fails to remedy the default before the end of the 60-day
period described in subclause (I), the license shall terminate without any further action on
the part of the mechanical licensing collective. Such termination renders the making of all
digital phonorecord deliveries of all musical works (and shares thereof) covered by the
blanket license for which the royalty or administrative assessment has not been paid
actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and subject to the remedies provided
by sections 502 through 506.

licensee coordinator become aware that a significant nonblanket licensee has failed to comply
with subparagraph (A), either may commence an action in an appropriate district court of the
United States for damages and injunctive relief. If the significant nonblanket licensee is
found liable, the court shall, absent a finding of excusable neglect, award damages in an
amount equal to three times the total amount of the unpaid administrative assessment and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 505, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,
as well as such other relief as the court determines appropriate. In all other cases, the court
shall award relief as appropriate. Any recovery of damages shall be payable to the

party at law or in equity.
(7) FUNDING OF MECHANICAL LICENSING COLLECTIVE.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The collective total costs shall be funded by—
(i) an administrative assessment, as such assessment is established by the Copyright
[Release Point 118-106]
Royalty Judges pursuant to subparagraph (D) from time to time, to be paid by—
(I) digital music providers that are engaged, in all or in part, in covered activities
pursuant to a blanket license; and
(II) significant nonblanket licensees; and
(ii) voluntary contributions from digital music providers and significant nonblanket
licensees as may be agreed with copyright owners.

collective shall be documented in a writing signed by an authorized agent of the
mechanical licensing collective and the contributing party.
(II) Such agreement shall be made available as required in proceedings before the
Copyright Royalty Judges to establish or adjust the administrative assessment in
accordance with applicable statutory and regulatory provisions and rulings of the
Copyright Royalty Judges.
(ii) TREATMENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS.—Each voluntary contribution described in
clause (i) shall be treated for purposes of an administrative assessment proceeding as an
offset to the collective total costs that would otherwise be recovered through the
administrative assessment. Any allocation or reallocation of voluntary contributions between
or among individual digital music providers or significant nonblanket licensees shall be a
matter of private negotiation and agreement among such parties and outside the scope of the
administrative assessment proceeding.
(C) INTERIM APPLICATION OF ACCRUED ROYALTIES.—In the event that the
administrative assessment, together with any funding from voluntary contributions as provided
in subparagraphs (A) and (B), is inadequate to cover current collective total costs, the collective,
with approval of its board of directors, may apply unclaimed accrued royalties on an interim
basis to defray such costs, subject to future reimbursement of such royalties from future
collections of the assessment.
(D) DETERMINATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE ASSESSMENT.—
(i) ADMINISTRATIVE ASSESSMENT TO COVER COLLECTIVE TOTAL COSTS
.—The administrative assessment shall be used solely and exclusively to fund the collective
total costs.
(ii) SEPARATE PROCEEDING BEFORE COPYRIGHT ROYALTY JUDGES.—The
amount and terms of the administrative assessment shall be determined and established in a
separate and independent proceeding before the Copyright Royalty Judges, according to the
procedures described in clauses (iii) and (iv). The administrative assessment determined in
such proceeding shall—
(I) be wholly independent of royalty rates and terms applicable to digital music
providers, which shall not be taken into consideration in any manner in establishing the
administrative assessment;
(II) be established by the Copyright Royalty Judges in an amount that is calculated to

administrative assessment that has been agreed to by the mechanical licensing collective and
the digital licensee coordinator (or if none has been designated, interested digital music
providers and significant nonblanket licensees representing more than half of the market for
uses of musical works in covered activities), except that the Copyright Royalty Judges shall
have the discretion to reject any such agreement for good cause shown. An administrative
assessment adopted under this clause shall apply to all digital music providers and significant
nonblanket licensees engaged in covered activities during the period the administrative
assessment is in effect.

agreed under subparagraph (C) shall supersede the interim rate and terms and apply
retroactively to the inception of the activity under the blanket license. In such case, not later
than 90 days after the effective date of the rate and terms established by the Copyright Royalty
Judges—
(i) if the rate established by the Copyright Royalty Judges exceeds the interim rate, the
digital music provider shall pay to the mechanical licensing collective the amount of any
underpayment of royalties due; or

engage in 1 or more covered activities with respect to a musical work, except that such
substitution shall not apply to any authority obtained from a record company pursuant to a
compulsory license to make and distribute permanent downloads unless and until such record
company terminates such authority in writing to take effect at the end of a monthly reporting
period, with a copy to the mechanical licensing collective.
(B) EXPIRATION OF EXISTING LICENSES.—Except to the extent provided in
subparagraph (A), on and after the license availability date, licenses other than individual
download licenses obtained under this section for covered activities prior to the license
availability date shall no longer continue in effect.

activity in effect on the license availability date will remain in effect unless and until the
voluntary license expires according to the terms of the voluntary license, or the parties agree to
amend or terminate the voluntary license. In a case where a voluntary license for a covered
activity entered into before the license availability date incorporates the terms of this section by
reference, the terms so incorporated (but not the rates) shall be those in effect immediately prior
to the license availability date, and those terms shall continue to apply unless and until such
voluntary license is terminated or amended, or the parties enter into a new voluntary license.

copyright owner from initial use of the work in accordance with this section and
applicable regulations, including the requisite certification under subsection (c)(2)(I);
(bb) beginning with the accounting period following the calendar month in which the

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
The provisions of section 1(e) and 101(e) of the present law [sections 1(e) and 101(e) of former title 17],
establishing a system of compulsory licensing for the making and distribution of phonorecords of copyrighted
music, are retained with a number of modifications and clarifications in section 115 of the bill. Under these
provisions, which represented a compromise of the most controversial issue of the 1909 act, a musical
composition that has been reproduced in phonorecords with the permission of the copyright owner may
generally be reproduced in phonorecords by another person, if that person notifies the copyright owner and
pays a specified royalty.
The fundamental question of whether to retain the compulsory license or to do away with it altogether was a
major issue during earlier stages of the program for general revision of the copyright law. At the hearings it
was apparent that the argument on this point had shifted, and the real issue was not whether to retain the
compulsory license but how much the royalty rate under it should be. The arguments for and against retention
of the compulsory license are outlined at pages 66–67 of this Committee's 1967 report (H. Rept. No. 83, 90th
Cong., 1st Sess.). The Committee's conclusion on this point remains the same as in 1967: "that a compulsory
licensing system is still warranted as a condition for the rights of reproducing and distributing phonorecords of
copyrighted music," but "that the present system is unfair and unnecessarily burdensome on copyright owners,
and that the present statutory rate is too low."
Availability and Scope of Compulsory License. Subsection (a) of section 115 deals with three doubtful
questions under the present law: (1) the nature of the original recording that will make the work available to
others for recording under a compulsory license; (2) the nature of the sound recording that can be made under
a compulsory license; and (3) the extent to which someone acting under a compulsory license can depart from
the work as written or recorded without violating the copyright owner's right to make an "arrangement" or
other derivative work. The first two of these questions are answered in clause (1) of section 115(a), and the
third is the subject of clause (2).
The present law, though not altogether clear, apparently bases compulsory licensing on the making or
licensing of the first recording, even if no authorized records are distributed to the public. The first sentence of
section 115(a)(1) would change the basis for compulsory licensing to authorized public distribution of
phonorecords (including disks and audio tapes but not the sound tracks or other sound records accompanying
a motion picture or other audiovisual work). Under the clause, a compulsory license would be available to
anyone as soon as "phonorecords of a nondramatic musical work have been distributed to the public in the
United States under the authority of the copyright owner."
The second sentence of clause (1), which has been the subject of some debate, provides that "a person may
obtain a compulsory license only if his or her primary purpose in making phonorecords is to distribute them to
the public for private use." This provision was criticized as being discriminatory against background music
[Release Point 118-106]
systems, since it would prevent a background music producer from making recordings without the express
consent of the copyright owner; it was argued that this could put the producer at a great competitive
disadvantage with performing rights societies, allow discrimination, and destroy or prevent entry of
businesses. The committee concluded, however, that the purpose of the compulsory license does not extend to
manufacturers of phonorecords that are intended primarily for commercial use, including not only
broadcasters and jukebox operators but also background music services.
The final sentence of clause (1) provides that a person may not obtain a compulsory license for use of the
work in the duplication of a sound recording made by another, unless the sound recording being duplicated
was itself fixed lawfully and the making of phonorecords duplicated from it was authorized by the owner of
copyright in the sound recording (or, if the recording was fixed before February 15, 1972, by the voluntary or
compulsory licensee of the music used in the recording). The basic intent of this sentence is to make clear that
a person is not entitled to a compulsory license of copyrighted musical works for the purpose of making an
unauthorized duplication of a musical sound recording originally developed and produced by another. It is the
view of the Committee that such was the original intent of the Congress in enacting the 1909 Copyright Act,
and it has been so construed by the 3d, 5th, 9th and 10th Circuits in the following cases: Duchess Music Corp.
v. Stern, 458 F.2d 1305 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 847 (1972) [93 S.Ct. 52, 34 L.Ed.2d 88]; Edward B.
Marks Music Corp. v. Colorado Magnetics, Inc., 497 F.2d 285, aff'd on rehearing en banc, 497 F.2d 292 (10th
Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1120 (1975) [95 S.Ct. 801, 42 L.Ed.2d 819]; Jondora Music Publishing Co.
v. Melody Recordings, Inc., 506 F.2d 392 (3d Cir. 1974, as amended 1975), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 1012 (1975)
[95 S.Ct. 2417, 44 L.Ed.2d 680]; and Fame Publishing Co. v. Alabama Custom Tape, Inc., 507 F.2d 667 (5th
Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 841 (1975) [96 S.Ct. 73, 46 L.Ed.2d 61].
Under this provision, it would be possible to obtain a compulsory license for the use of copyrighted music
under section 115 if the owner of the sound recording being duplicated authorizes its duplication. This does
not, however, in any way require the owner of the original sound recording to grant a license to duplicate the
original sound recording. It is not intended that copyright protection for sound recordings be circumscribed by
requiring the owners of sound recordings to grant a compulsory license to unauthorized duplicators or others.
The second clause of subsection (a) is intended to recognize the practical need for a limited privilege to
make arrangements of music being used under a compulsory license, but without allowing the music to be
perverted, distorted, or travestied. Clause (2) permits arrangements of a work "to the extent necessary to
conform it to the style or manner of interpretation of the performance involved," so long as it does not "change
the basic melody or fundamental character of the work." The provision also prohibits the compulsory licensee
from claiming an independent copyright in his arrangement as a "derivative work" without the express consent
of the copyright owner.
Procedure for Obtaining Compulsory License. Section 115(b)(1) requires anyone who wishes to take
advantage of the compulsory licensing provisions to serve a "notice of intention to obtain a compulsory
license," which is much like the "notice of intention to use" required by the present law. Under section 115,
the notice must be served before any phonorecords are distributed, but service can take place "before or within
30 days after making" any phonorecords. The notice is to be served on the copyright owner, but if the owner is
not identified in the Copyright Office records, "it shall be sufficient to file the notice of intention in the
Copyright Office."
The Committee deleted clause (2) of section 115(b) of S. 22 as adopted by the Senate. The provision was a
vestige of jukebox provisions in earlier bills, and its requirements no longer served any useful purpose.
Clause (2) [formerly clause (3)] of section 115(b) [cl. (2) of subsec. (b) of this section] provides that
"failure to serve or file the notice required by clause (1) * * * forecloses the possibility of a compulsory
license and, in the absence of a negotiated license, renders the making and distribution of phonorecords
actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided by sections
502 through 506." The remedies provided in section 501 are those applicable to infringements generally.
Royalty Payable Under Compulsory License. Identification of Copyright Owner.—Under the present
law a copyright owner is obliged to file a "notice of use" in the Copyright Office, stating that the initial
recording of the copyrighted work has been made or licensed, in order to recover against an unauthorized
record manufacturer. This requirement has resulted in a technical loss of rights in some cases, and serves little
or no purpose where the registration and assignment records of the Copyright Office already show the facts of
ownership. Section 115(c)(1) therefore drops any formal "notice of use" requirements and merely provides
that, "to be entitled to receive royalties under a compulsory license, the copyright owner must be identified in
the registration or other public records of the Copyright Office." On the other hand, since proper identification
is an important precondition of recovery, the bill further provides that "the owner is entitled to royalties for
phonorecords manufactured and distributed after being so identified, but is not entitled to recover for any
phonorecords previously made and distributed."
[Release Point 118-106]
Basis of Royalty.—Under the present statute the specified royalty is payable "on each such part
manufactured," regardless of how many "parts" (i.e., records) are sold. This basis for calculating the royalty
has been revised in section 115(c)(2) to provide that "the royalty under a compulsory license shall be payable
for every phonorecord made and distributed in accordance with the license." This basis is more compatible
with the general practice in negotiated licenses today. It is unjustified to require a compulsory licensee to pay
license fees on records which merely go into inventory, which may later be destroyed, and from which the
record producer gains no economic benefit.
It is intended that the Register of Copyrights will prescribe regulations insuring that copyright owners will
receive full and prompt payment for all phonorecords made and distributed. Section 115(c)(2) states that "a
phonorecord is considered 'distributed' if the person exercising the compulsory license has voluntarily and
permanently parted with its possession." For this purpose, the concept of "distribution" comprises any act by
which the person exercising the compulsory license voluntarily relinquishes possession of a phonorecord
(considered as a fungible unit), regardless of whether the distribution is to the public, passes title, constitutes a
gift, or is sold, rented, leased, or loaned, unless it is actually returned and the transaction cancelled. Neither
involuntary relinquishment, as through theft or fire, nor the destruction of unwanted records, would constitute
"distribution."
The term "made" is intended to be broader than "manufactured," and to include within its scope every
possible manufacturing or other process capable of reproducing a sound recording in phonorecords. The use of
the phrase "made and distributed" establishes the basis upon which the royalty rate for compulsory licensing
under section 115 is to be calculated, but it is in no way intended to weaken the liability of record pressers and
other manufacturers and makers of phonorecords for copyright infringement where the compulsory licensing
requirements have not been met. As under the present law, even if a presser, manufacturer, or other maker had
no role in the distribution process, that person would be regarded as jointly and severally liable in a case
where the court finds that infringement has taken place because of failure to comply with the provisions of
section 115.
Under existing practices in the record industry, phonorecords are distributed to wholesalers and retailers
with the privilege of returning unsold copies for credit or exchange. As a result, the number of recordings that
have been "permanently" distributed will not usually be known until some time—six or seven months on the
average—after the initial distribution. In recognition of this problem, it has become a well-established industry
practice, under negotiated licenses, for record companies to maintain reasonable reserves of the mechanical
royalties due the copyright owners, against which royalties on the returns can be offset. The Committee
recognizes that this practice may be consistent with the statutory requirements for monthly compulsory license
accounting reports, but recognizes the possibility that, without proper safeguards, the maintenance of such
reserves could be manipulated to avoid making payments of the full amounts owing to copyright owners.
Under these circumstances, the regulations prescribed by the Register of Copyrights should contain detailed
provisions ensuring that the ultimate disposition of every phonorecord made under a compulsory license is
accounted for, and that payment is made for every phonorecord "voluntarily and permanently" distributed. In
particular, the Register should prescribe a point in time when, for accounting purposes under section 115, a
phonorecord will be considered "permanently distributed," and should prescribe the situations in which a
compulsory licensee is barred from maintaining reserves (e.g., situations in which the compulsory licensee has
frequently failed to make payments in the past.)
Rate of Royalty.—A large preponderance of the extensive testimony presented to the Committee on section
115 was devoted to the question of the amount of the statutory royalty rate. An extensive review and analysis
of the testimony and arguments received on this question appear in the 1974 Senate report (S. Rep. No.
94–473) at page 71–94.
While upon initial review it might be assumed that the rate established in 1909 would not be reasonable at
the present time, the committee believes that an increase in the mechanical royalty rate must be justified on
the basis of existing economic conditions and not on the mere passage of 67 years. Following a thorough
analysis of the problem, the Committee considers that an increase of the present two-cent royalty to a rate of
2¾ cents (or .6 of one cent per minute or fraction of playing time) is justified. This rate will be subject to
review by the Copyright Royalty Commission, as provided by section 801, in 1980 and at 10-year intervals
thereafter.
Accounting and Payment of Royalties; Effect of Default. Clause (3) of Section 115(c) provides that
royalty payments are to be made on a monthly basis, in accordance with requirements that the Register of
Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation. In order to increase the protection of copyright proprietors against
economic harm from companies which might refuse or fail to pay their just obligations, compulsory licensees
will also be required to make a detailed cumulative annual statement of account, certified by a Certified Public
Accountant.
[Release Point 118-106]
A source of criticism with respect to the compulsory licensing provisions of the present statute has been the
rather ineffective sanctions against default by compulsory licensees. Clause (4) of section 115(c) corrects this
defect by permitting the copyright owner to serve written notice on a defaulting licensee, and by providing for
termination of the compulsory license if the default is not remedied within 30 days after notice is given.
Termination under this clause "renders either the making or the distribution, or both, of all phonorecords for
which the royalty had not been paid, actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and fully subject to
the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506."

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
As the program for general revision of the copyright law has evolved, it has become increasingly apparent
that in one major area the problems are not sufficiently developed for a definitive legislative solution. This is
the area of computer uses of copyrighted works: the use of a work "in conjunction with automatic systems
capable of storing, processing, retrieving, or transferring information." The Commission on New
Technological Uses is, among other things, now engaged in making a thorough study of the emerging patterns
in this field and it will, on the basis of its findings, recommend definitive copyright provisions to deal with the
situation.
Since it would be premature to change existing law on computer uses at present, the purpose of section 117
[Release Point 118-106]
is to preserve the status quo. It is intended neither to cut off any rights that may now exist, nor to create new
rights that might be denied under the Act of 1909 or under common law principles currently applicable.
The provision deals only with the exclusive rights of a copyright owner with respect to computer uses, that
is, the bundle of rights specified for other types of uses in section 106 and qualified in sections 107 through
116 and 118. With respect to the copyright-ability of computer programs, the ownership of copyrights in
them, the term of protection, and the formal requirements of the remainder of the bill, the new statute would
apply.
Under section 117, an action for infringement of a copyrighted work by means of a computer would
necessarily be a federal action brought under the new title 17. The court, in deciding the scope of exclusive
rights in the computer area, would first need to determine the applicable law, whether State statutory or
common law or the Act of 1909. Having determined what law was applicable, its decision would depend upon
its interpretation of what that law was on the point on the day before the effective date of the new statute.

without any greater or lesser rights with respect to the use of the work in conjunction with automatic systems
capable of storing, processing, retrieving, or transferring information, or in conjunction with any similar
device, machine, or process, than those afforded to works under the law, whether this title or the common law
or statutes of a State, in effect on Dec. 31, 1977, as held applicable and construed by the court in an action
brought under this title.
§118. Scope of exclusive rights: Use of certain works in connection with

payments and the proportionate division of fees paid among various copyright owners, and may
designate common agents to negotiate, agree to, pay, or receive payments.
(1) Any owner of copyright in a work specified in this subsection or any public broadcasting
entity may submit to the Copyright Royalty Judges proposed licenses covering such activities with
respect to such works.
(2) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time between one or more copyright
owners and one or more public broadcasting entities shall be given effect in lieu of any
determination by the Librarian of Congress or the Copyright Royalty Judges, if copies of such
agreements are filed with the Copyright Royalty Judges within 30 days of execution in accordance
with regulations that the Copyright Royalty Judges shall issue.
(3) Voluntary negotiation proceedings initiated pursuant to a petition filed under section 804(a)
for the purpose of determining a schedule of terms and rates of royalty payments by public
broadcasting entities to owners of copyright in works specified by this subsection and the
proportionate division of fees paid among various copyright owners shall cover the 5-year period
beginning on January 1 of the second year following the year in which the petition is filed. The
parties to each negotiation proceeding shall bear their own costs.
(4) In the absence of license agreements negotiated under paragraph (2) or (3), the Copyright
Royalty Judges shall, pursuant to chapter 8, conduct a proceeding to determine and publish in the

Federal Register a schedule of rates and terms which, subject to paragraph (2), shall be binding on
all owners of copyright in works specified by this subsection and public broadcasting entities,
regardless of whether such copyright owners have submitted proposals to the Copyright Royalty
Judges. In establishing such rates and terms the Copyright Royalty Judges may consider the rates
for comparable circumstances under voluntary license agreements negotiated as provided in
paragraph (2) or (3). The Copyright Royalty Judges shall also establish requirements by which
copyright owners may receive reasonable notice of the use of their works under this section, and
under which records of such use shall be kept by public broadcasting entities.

paragraph (1) of section 110, but only if the reproductions are used for performances or displays
for a period of no more than seven days from the date of the transmission specified in paragraph
(1), and are destroyed before or at the end of such period. No person supplying, in accordance
with paragraph (2), a reproduction of a transmission program to governmental bodies or nonprofit
institutions under this paragraph shall have any liability as a result of failure of such body or
institution to destroy such reproduction: Provided, That it shall have notified such body or
institution of the requirement for such destruction pursuant to this paragraph: And provided further
, That if such body or institution itself fails to destroy such reproduction it shall be deemed to have
infringed.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
[Release Point 118-106]
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
General Background. During its consideration of revision legislation in 1975, the Senate Judiciary
Committee adopted an amendment offered by Senator Charles McC. Mathias. The amendment, now section
118 of the Senate bill [this section], grants to public broadcasting a compulsory license for use of nondramatic
literary and musical works, as well as pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works, subject to payment of
reasonable royalty fees to be set by the Copyright Royalty Tribunal established by that bill. The Mathias
amendment requires that public broadcasters, at periodic intervals, file a notice with the Copyright Office
containing information required by the Register of Copyrights and deposit a statement of account and the total
royalty fees for the period covered by the statement. In July of each year all persons having a claim to such
fees are to file their claims with the Register of Copyrights. If no controversy exists, the Register would
distribute the royalties to the various copyright owners and their agents after deducting reasonable
administrative costs; controversies are to be settled by the Tribunal.
On July 10, 1975, the House Subcommittee heard testimony on the Mathias amendment from
representatives of public broadcasters, authors, publishers, and music performing rights societies. The public
broadcasters pointed to Congressional concern for the development of their activities as evidenced by the
Public Broadcasting Act [47 U.S.C. 390 et seq.]. They urged that a compulsory license was essential to assure
public broadcasting broad access to copyrighted materials at reasonable royalties and without administratively
cumbersome and costly "clearance" problems that would impair the vitality of their operations. The opponents
of the amendment argued that the nature of public broadcasting has changed significantly in the past decade,
to the extent that it now competes with commercial broadcasting as a national entertainment and cultural
medium. They asserted that the performing rights society arrangements under which copyrighted music is
licensed for performance removed any problem in clearing music for broadcasting, and that voluntary
agreements could adequately resolve the copyright problems feared by public broadcasters, at less expense
and burden than the compulsory license, for synchronization and literary rights. The authors of literary works
stressed that a compulsory licensing system would deny them the fundamental right to control the use of their
works and protect their reputation in a major communications medium.
General Policy Considerations. The Committee is cognizant of the intent of Congress, in enacting the
Public Broadcasting Act on November 7, 1967 [47 U.S.C. 390 et seq.], that encouragement and support of
noncommercial broadcasting is in the public interest. It is also aware that public broadcasting may encounter
problems not confronted by commercial broadcasting enterprises, due to such factors as the special nature of
programming, repeated use of programs, and, of course, limited financial resources. Thus, the Committee
determined that the nature of public broadcasting does warrant special treatment in certain areas. However, the
Committee did not feel that the broad compulsory license provided in the Senate bill is necessary to the
continued successful operation of public broadcasting. In addition, the Committee believes that the system
provided in the Senate bill for the deposit of royalty fees with the Copyright Office for distribution to
claimants, and the resolution of disputes over such distribution by a statutory tribunal, can be replaced by
payments directly between the parties, without the intervention of government machinery and its attendant
administrative costs.
In general, the Committee amended the public broadcasting provisions of the Senate bill toward attainment
of the objective clearly stated in the Report of the Senate Judiciary Committee, namely, that copyright owners
and public broadcasters be encouraged to reach voluntary private agreements.
Procedures. Not later than thirty days following the publication by the President of the notice announcing
the initial appointments to the Copyright Royalty Commission (specified in Chapter 8 [§801 et seq. of this
title]), the Chairman of the Commission is to publish notice in the Federal Register of the initiation of
proceedings to determine "reasonable terms and rates" for certain uses of published nondramatic musical
works and published pictorial, graphic and sculptural works, during a period ending on December 31, 1982.
Copyright owners and public broadcasting entities that do not reach voluntary agreement are bound by the
terms and rates established by the Commission, which are to be published in the Federal Register within six
months of the notice of initiation of proceedings. During the period between the effective date of the Act [Jan.
1, 1978] and the publication of the rates and terms, the Committee has preserved the status quo by providing,
in section 118(b)(4), that the Act does not afford to copyright owners or public broadcasting entities any
greater or lesser rights with respect to the relevant uses of nondramatic musical works and pictorial, graphic,
and sculptural works than those afforded under the law in effect on December 31, 1977.
License agreements that have been voluntarily negotiated supersede, as between the parties to the
agreement, the terms and rates established by the Commission, provided that copies of the agreements are
properly filed with the Copyright Office within 30 days of execution. Under clause (2) of section 118(b), the
agreements may be negotiated "at any time"—whether before, during, or after determinations by the
Commission.
[Release Point 118-106]
Under section 118(c), the procedures for the Commission's establishing such rates and terms are to be
repeated in the last half of 1982 and every five years thereafter.
Establishment of Reasonable Terms and Rates. In establishing reasonable terms and rates for public
broadcasting use of the specified works, the Commission, under clause (b)(1) of section 118 is to consider
proposals timely submitted to it, as well as "any other relevant information", including that put forward for its
consideration "by any interested party."
The Committee does not intend that owners of copyrighted material be required to subsidize public
broadcasting. It is intended that the Commission assure a fair return to copyright owners without unfairly
burdening public broadcasters. Section 118(b)(3) provides that "the Commission may consider the rates for
comparable circumstances under voluntary license agreements." The Commission is also expected to consider
both the general public interest in encouraging the growth and development of public broadcasting, and the
"promotion of science and the useful arts" through the encouragement of musical and artistic creation.
The Committee anticipates that the "terms" established by the Commission shall include provisions as to
acceptable methods of payment of royalties by public broadcasting entities to copyright owners. For example,
where the whereabouts of the copyright owner may not be readily known, the terms should specify the nature
of the obligation of the public broadcasting entity to locate the owner, or to set aside or otherwise assure
payment of appropriate royalties, should he or she appear and make a claim. Section 118(b)(3) requires the
Commission "to establish requirements by which copyright owners may receive reasonable notice of the use
of their works." The Committee intends that these requirements shall not impose undue hardships on public
broadcasting entities and, in the above illustration, shall provide for the specific termination of any period
during which the public broadcasting entity is required to set aside payments. It is expected that, in some
cases, especially in the area of pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works, the whereabouts of the owners of
copyright may not be known and they may never appear to claim payment of royalties.
The Commission is also to establish record keeping requirements for public broadcasting entities in order to
facilitate the identification, calculation, allocation and payment of claims and royalties.
Works Affected. Under sections 118(b) and (e) of the Committee's amendment, the establishment of rates
and terms by the Copyright Royalty Commission pertains only to the use of published nondramatic musical
works, and published pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works. As under the Senate bill; rights in plays, operas,
ballet and other stage presentations, motion pictures, and other audiovisual works are not affected.
Section 118(f) is intended to make clear that this section does not permit unauthorized use, beyond the
limits of section 107, of individual frames from a filmstrip or any other portion of any audiovisual work.
Additionally, the application of this section to pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works does not extend to the
production of transmission programs drawn to any substantial extent from a compilation of such works.
The Committee also concluded that the performance of nondramatic literary works should not be subject to
Commission determination. It was particularly concerned that a compulsory license for literary works would
result in loss of control by authors over the use of their work in violation of basic principles of artistic and
creative freedom. It is recognized that copyright not only provides compensation to authors, but also
protection as to how and where their works are used. The Committee was assured by representatives of
authors and publishers that licensing arrangements for readings from their books, poems, and other works on
public broadcasting programs for reasonable compensation and under reasonable safeguards for authors' rights
could be worked out in private negotiation. The Committee strongly urges the parties to work toward mutually
acceptable licenses; to facilitate their negotiations and aid in the possible establishment of clearance
mechanisms and rates, the Committee's amendment provides the parties, in section 118(e)(1), with an
appropriately limited exemption from the antitrust laws [15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.].
The Committee has also provided, in paragraph (2) of clause (e), that on January 3, 1980, the Register of
Copyrights, after consultation with the interested parties, shall submit a report to Congress on the extent to
which voluntary licensing arrangements have been reached with respect to public broadcast use of
nondramatic literary works, and present legislative or other recommendations, if warranted.
The use of copyrighted sound recordings in educational television and radio programs distributed by or
through public broadcasting entities is governed by section 114 and is discussed in connection with that
section.
Activities Affected. Section 118(d) specifies the activities which may be engaged in by public broadcasting
entities under terms and rates established by the Commission. These include the performance or display of
published nondramatic musical works, and of published pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works, in the course
of transmissions by noncommercial educational broadcast stations; and the production, reproduction, and
distribution of transmission programs including such works by nonprofit organizations for the purpose of such
[Release Point 118-106]
transmissions. It is the intent of the Committee that "interconnection" activities serving as a technical adjunct
to such transmissions, such as the use of satellites or microwave equipment, be included within the specified
activities.
Paragraph (3) of clause (d) also includes the reproduction, simultaneously with transmission, of public
broadcasting programs by governmental bodies or nonprofit institutions, and the performance or display of the
contents of the reproduction under the conditions of section 110(1). However, the reproduction so made must
be destroyed at the end of seven days from the transmission.
This limited provision for unauthorized simultaneous or off-the-air reproduction is limited to nondramatic
musical works and pictorial, graphic and sculptural works included in public broadcasting transmissions. It
does not extend to other works included in the transmissions, or to the entire transmission program.
It is the intent of the Committee that schools be permitted to engage in off-the-air reproduction to the extent
and under the conditions provided in [section] 118(d)(3); however, in the event a public broadcasting station
or producer makes the reproduction and distributes a copy to the school, the station or producer will not be
held liable for the school's failure to destroy the reproduction, provided it has given notice of the requirement
of destruction. In such a case the school itself, although it did not engage in the act of reproduction, is deemed
an infringer fully subject to the remedies provided in Chapter 5 of the Act [§501 et seq. of this title]. The
establishment of standards for adequate notice under this provision should be considered by the Commission.
Section 118(f) makes it clear that the rights of performance and other activities specified in subsection (d)
do not extend to the unauthorized dramatization of a nondramatic musical work.

(a) SECONDARY TRANSMISSIONS BY SATELLITE CARRIERS.—
(1) NON-NETWORK STATIONS.—Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (6) of
this subsection and section 114(d), secondary transmissions of a performance or display of a work
embodied in a primary transmission made by a non-network station shall be subject to statutory
licensing under this section if the secondary transmission is made by a satellite carrier to the
public for private home viewing or for viewing in a commercial establishment, with regard to
secondary transmissions the satellite carrier is in compliance with the rules, regulations, or
authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission governing the carriage of television
broadcast station signals, and the carrier makes a direct or indirect charge for each retransmission
service to each subscriber receiving the secondary transmission or to a distributor that has
contracted with the carrier for direct or indirect delivery of the secondary transmission to the
public for private home viewing or for viewing in a commercial establishment.
(2) NETWORK STATIONS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph and
paragraphs (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this subsection and section 114(d), secondary transmissions
of a performance or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission made by a network
station shall be subject to statutory licensing under this section if the secondary transmission is
made by a satellite carrier to the public for private home viewing, with regard to secondary
transmissions the satellite carrier is in compliance with the rules, regulations, or authorizations
of the Federal Communications Commission governing the carriage of television broadcast
station signals, the carrier makes a direct or indirect charge for such retransmission service to
each subscriber receiving the secondary transmission, and the carrier provides local-into-local
service to all DMAs. Failure to reach an agreement with a network station to retransmit the
signals of the station shall not be construed to affect compliance with providing local-into-local
service to all DMAs if the satellite carrier has the capability to retransmit such signals when an
agreement is reached.
(B) SECONDARY TRANSMISSIONS TO UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—The statutory license provided for in subparagraph (A) shall be
limited to secondary transmissions of the signals of no more than two network stations in a
single day for each television network to persons who reside in unserved households.
(ii) SHORT MARKETS.—In the case of secondary transmissions to households located in
short markets, subject to clause (i), the statutory license shall be further limited to secondary
transmissions of only those primary transmissions of network stations that embody the
[Release Point 118-106]
programming of networks not offered on the primary stream or the multicast stream
transmitted by any network station in that market.
(C) SUBMISSION OF SUBSCRIBER LISTS TO NETWORKS.—
(i) INITIAL LISTS.—A satellite carrier that makes secondary transmissions of a primary
transmission made by a network station pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall, not later than 90
days after commencing such secondary transmissions, submit to the network that owns or is
affiliated with the network station a list identifying (by name and address, including street or
rural route number, city, State, and 9-digit zip code) all subscribers to which the satellite
carrier makes secondary transmissions of that primary transmission to subscribers in
unserved households.
(ii) MONTHLY LISTS.—After the submission of the initial lists under clause (i), the
satellite carrier shall, not later than the 15th of each month, submit to the network a list,
aggregated by designated market area, identifying (by name and address, including street or
rural route number, city, State, and 9-digit zip code) any persons who have been added or
dropped as subscribers under clause (i) since the last submission under this subparagraph.
(iii) USE OF SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION.—Subscriber information submitted by a
satellite carrier under this subparagraph may be used only for purposes of monitoring
compliance by the satellite carrier with this subsection.
(iv) APPLICABILITY.—The submission requirements of this subparagraph shall apply to
a satellite carrier only if the network to which the submissions are to be made places on file
with the Register of Copyrights a document identifying the name and address of the person to
whom such submissions are to be made. The Register shall maintain for public inspection a
file of all such documents.
(3) NONCOMPLIANCE WITH REPORTING AND PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS
.—Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2), the willful or repeated secondary
transmission to the public by a satellite carrier of a primary transmission made by a non-network
station or a network station and embodying a performance or display of a work is actionable as an
act of infringement under section 501, and is fully subject to the remedies provided by sections
502 through 506, where the satellite carrier has not deposited the statement of account and royalty
fee required by subsection (b), or has failed to make the submissions to networks required by
paragraph (2)(C).
(4) WILLFUL ALTERATIONS.—Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2),
the secondary transmission to the public by a satellite carrier of a performance or display of a
work embodied in a primary transmission made by a non-network station or a network station is
actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is fully subject to the remedies
provided by sections 502 through 506 and section 510, if the content of the particular program in
which the performance or display is embodied, or any commercial advertising or station
announcement transmitted by the primary transmitter during, or immediately before or after, the
transmission of such program, is in any way willfully altered by the satellite carrier through
changes, deletions, or additions, or is combined with programming from any other broadcast
signal.
(5) VIOLATION OF TERRITORIAL RESTRICTIONS ON STATUTORY LICENSE FOR
NETWORK STATIONS.—
(A) INDIVIDUAL VIOLATIONS.—The willful or repeated secondary transmission by a
satellite carrier of a primary transmission made by a network station and embodying a
performance or display of a work to a subscriber who is not eligible to receive the transmission
under this section is actionable as an act of infringement under section 501 and is fully subject
to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506, except that—
(i) no damages shall be awarded for such act of infringement if the satellite carrier took
corrective action by promptly withdrawing service from the ineligible subscriber, and
(ii) any statutory damages shall not exceed $250 for such subscriber for each month during
[Release Point 118-106]
which the violation occurred.
(B) PATTERN OF VIOLATIONS.—If a satellite carrier engages in a willful or repeated
pattern or practice of delivering a primary transmission made by a network station and
embodying a performance or display of a work to subscribers who are not eligible to receive the
transmission under this section, then in addition to the remedies set forth in subparagraph (A)—
(i) if the pattern or practice has been carried out on a substantially nationwide basis, the
court shall order a permanent injunction barring the secondary transmission by the satellite
carrier, for private home viewing, of the primary transmissions of any primary network
station affiliated with the same network, and the court may order statutory damages of not to
exceed $2,500,000 for each 3-month period during which the pattern or practice was carried
out; and
(ii) if the pattern or practice has been carried out on a local or regional basis, the court shall
order a permanent injunction barring the secondary transmission, for private home viewing in
that locality or region, by the satellite carrier of the primary transmissions of any primary
network station affiliated with the same network, and the court may order statutory damages
of not to exceed $2,500,000 for each 6-month period during which the pattern or practice was
carried out.
(C) PREVIOUS SUBSCRIBERS EXCLUDED.—Subparagraphs (A) and (B) do not apply to
secondary transmissions by a satellite carrier to persons who subscribed to receive such
secondary transmissions from the satellite carrier or a distributor before November 16, 1988.

shall have the burden of proving that its secondary transmission of a primary transmission by a
network station is to a subscriber who is eligible to receive the secondary transmission under
this section.
The court shall direct one half of any statutory damages ordered under clause (i) 1 to be deposited
with the Register of Copyrights for distribution to copyright owners pursuant to subsection (b).
The Copyright Royalty Judges shall issue regulations establishing procedures for distributing such
funds, on a proportional basis, to copyright owners whose works were included in the secondary
transmissions that were the subject of the statutory damages.
(6) DISCRIMINATION BY A SATELLITE CARRIER.—Notwithstanding the provisions of
paragraph (1), the willful or repeated secondary transmission to the public by a satellite carrier of a
performance or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission made by a non-network
station or a network station is actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is fully
subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506, if the satellite carrier unlawfully
discriminates against a distributor.

performance or display of a work made by a broadcast station licensed by the Federal
Communications Commission is actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is
fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506, if, at the time of such
transmission, the satellite carrier is not in compliance with the rules, regulations, and
authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission concerning the carriage of television
broadcast station signals.

semiannual basis, deposit with the Register of Copyrights, in accordance with requirements that
the Register shall prescribe by regulation—
(A) a statement of account, covering the preceding 6-month period, specifying the names and
locations of all non-network stations and network stations whose signals were retransmitted, at
any time during that period, to subscribers as described in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), the total
number of subscribers that received such retransmissions, and such other data as the Register of
Copyrights may from time to time prescribe by regulation;

manner as the Secretary of the Treasury directs. All funds held by the Secretary of the Treasury
shall be invested in interest-bearing securities of the United States for later distribution with
interest by the Librarian of Congress as provided by this title.
(4) PERSONS TO WHOM FEES ARE DISTRIBUTED.—The royalty fees deposited under
paragraph (3) shall, in accordance with the procedures provided by paragraph (5), be distributed to
those copyright owners whose works were included in a secondary transmission made by a
satellite carrier during the applicable 6-month accounting period and who file a claim with the
Copyright Royalty Judges under paragraph (5).
(5) PROCEDURES FOR DISTRIBUTION.—The royalty fees deposited under paragraph (3)
shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures:
(A) FILING OF CLAIMS FOR FEES.—During the month of July in each year, each person
claiming to be entitled to statutory license fees for secondary transmissions shall file a claim
with the Copyright Royalty Judges, in accordance with requirements that the Copyright Royalty
Judges shall prescribe by regulation. For purposes of this paragraph, any claimants may agree
among themselves as to the proportionate division of statutory license fees among them, may
lump their claims together and file them jointly or as a single claim, or may designate a
common agent to receive payment on their behalf.
(B) DETERMINATION OF CONTROVERSY; DISTRIBUTIONS.—After the first day of
August of each year, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall determine whether there exists a
controversy concerning the distribution of royalty fees. If the Copyright Royalty Judges
determine that no such controversy exists, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall authorize the
Librarian of Congress to proceed to distribute such fees to the copyright owners entitled to
receive them, or to their designated agents, subject to the deduction of reasonable administrative
costs under this section. If the Copyright Royalty Judges find the existence of a controversy, the
Copyright Royalty Judges shall, pursuant to chapter 8 of this title, conduct a proceeding to
determine the distribution of royalty fees.
(C) WITHHOLDING OF FEES DURING CONTROVERSY.—During the pendency of any
proceeding under this subsection, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall have the discretion to
authorize the Librarian of Congress to proceed to distribute any amounts that are not in
controversy.

Copyright Royalty Judges shall adjust royalty fees to account for the obligations of the
parties under any applicable voluntary agreement filed with the Copyright Royalty Judges in
accordance with subparagraph (D). In determining the fair market value, the Judges shall
base their decision on economic, competitive, and programming information presented by the
parties, including—
(I) the competitive environment in which such programming is distributed, the cost of
similar signals in similar private and compulsory license marketplaces, and any special

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Initial Ownership. Two basic and well-established principles of copyright law are restated in section
201(a): that the source of copyright ownership is the author of the work, and that, in the case of a "joint work,"
the coauthors of the work are likewise coowners of the copyright. Under the definition of section 101, a work
is "joint" if the authors collaborated with each other, or if each of the authors prepared his or her contribution
with the knowledge and intention that it would be merged with the contributions of other authors as
"inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole." The touchstone here is the intention, at the time the
writing is done, that the parts be absorbed or combined into an integrated unit, although the parts themselves
may be either "inseparable" (as the case of a novel or painting) or "interdependent" (as in the case of a motion
picture, opera, or the words and music of a song). The definition of "joint work" is to be contrasted with the
definition of "collective work," also in section 101, in which the elements of merger and unity are lacking;
there the key elements are assemblage or gathering of "separate and independent works * * * into a collective
whole."
The definition of "joint works" has prompted some concern lest it be construed as converting the authors of
previously written works, such as plays, novels, and music, into coauthors of a motion picture in which their
work is incorporated. It is true that a motion picture would normally be a joint rather than a collective work
with respect to those authors who actually work on the film, although their usual status as employees for hire
would keep the question of coownership from coming up. On the other hand, although a novelist, playwright,
or songwriter may write a work with the hope or expectation that it will be used in a motion picture, this is
clearly a case of separate or independent authorship rather than one where the basic intention behind the
writing of the work was for motion picture use. In this case, the motion picture is a derivative work within the
definition of that term, and section 103 makes plain that copyright in a derivative work is independent of, and
does not enlarge the scope of rights in, any preexisting material incorporated in it. There is thus no need to
spell this conclusion out in the definition of "joint work."
There is also no need for a specific statutory provision concerning the rights and duties of the coowners of a
work; court-made law on this point is left undisturbed. Under the bill, as under the present law, coowners of a
copyright would be treated generally as tenants in common, with each coowner having an independent right to
use or license the use of a work, subject to a duty of accounting to the other coowners for any profits.
Works Made for Hire. Section 201(b) of the bill adopts one of the basic principles of the present law: that
in the case of works made for hire the employer is considered the author of the work, and is regarded as the
initial owner of copyright unless there has been an agreement otherwise. The subsection also requires that any
agreement under which the employee is to own rights be in writing and signed by the parties.
The work-made-for-hire provisions of this bill represent a carefully balanced compromise, and as such they
do not incorporate the amendments proposed by screenwriters and composers for motion pictures. Their
proposal was for the recognition of something similar to the "shop right" doctrine of patent law: with some
exceptions, the employer would acquire the right to use the employee's work to the extent needed for purposes
of his regular business, but the employee would retain all other rights as long as he or she refrained from the
authorizing of competing uses. However, while this change might theoretically improve the bargaining
position of screenwriters and others as a group, the practical benefits that individual authors would receive are
highly conjectural. The presumption that initial ownership rights vest in the employer for hire is well
established in American copyright law, and to exchange that for the uncertainties of the shop right doctrine
would not only be of dubious value to employers and employees alike, but might also reopen a number of
other issues.
The status of works prepared on special order or commission was a major issue in the development of the
definition of "works made for hire" in section 101, which has undergone extensive revision during the
legislative process. The basic problem is how to draw a statutory line between those works written on special
[Release Point 118-106]
order or commission that should be considered as "works made for hire," and those that should not. The
definition now provided by the bill represents a compromise which, in effect, spells out those specific
categories of commissioned works that can be considered "works made for hire" under certain circumstances.
Of these, one of the most important categories is that of "instructional texts." This term is given its own
definition in the bill: "a literary, pictorial, or graphic work prepared for publication with the purpose of use in
systematic instructional activities." The concept is intended to include what might be loosely called "textbook
material," whether or not in book form or prepared in the form of text matter. The basic characteristic of
"instructional texts" is the purpose of their preparation for "use in systematic instructional activities," and they
are to be distinguished from works prepared for use by a general readership.
Contributions to Collective Works. Subsection (c) of section 201 deals with the troublesome problem of
ownership of copyright in contributions to collective works, and the relationship between copyright ownership
in a contribution and in the collective work in which it appears. The first sentence establishes the basic
principle that copyright in the individual contribution and copyright in the collective work as a whole are
separate and distinct, and that the author of the contribution is, as in every other case, the first owner of
copyright in it. Under the definitions in section 101, a "collective work" is a species of "compilation" and, by
its nature, must involve the selection, assembly, and arrangement of "a number of contributions." Examples of
"collective works" would ordinarily include periodical issues, anthologies, symposia, and collections of the
discrete writings of the same authors, but not cases, such as a composition consisting of words and music, a
work published with illustrations or front matter, or three one-act plays, where relatively few separate
elements have been brought together. Unlike the contents of other types of "compilations," each of the
contributions incorporated in a "collective work" must itself constitute a "separate and independent" work,
therefore ruling out compilations of information or other uncopyrightable material and works published with
editorial revisions or annotations. Moreover, as noted above, there is a basic distinction between a "joint
work," where the separate elements merge into a unified whole, and a "collective work," where they remain
unintegrated and disparate.
The bill does nothing to change the rights of the owner of copyright in a collective work under the present
law. These exclusive rights extend to the elements of compilation and editing that went into the collective
work as a whole, as well as the contributions that were written for hire by employees of the owner of the
collective work, and those copyrighted contributions that have been transferred in writing to the owner by
their authors. However, one of the most significant aims of the bill is to clarify and improve the present
confused and frequently unfair legal situation with respect to rights in contributions.
The second sentence of section 201(c), in conjunction with the provisions of section 404 dealing with
copyright notice, will preserve the author's copyright in a contribution even if the contribution does not bear a
separate notice in the author's name, and without requiring any unqualified transfer of rights to the owner of
the collective work. This is coupled with a presumption that, unless there has been an express transfer of
more, the owner of the collective work acquires, "only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the
contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later
collective work in the same series."
The basic presumption of section 201(c) is fully consistent with present law and practice, and represents a
fair balancing of equities. At the same time, the last clause of the subsection, under which the privilege of
republishing the contribution under certain limited circumstances would be presumed, is an essential
counterpart of the basic presumption. Under the language of this clause a publishing company could reprint a
contribution from one issue in a later issue of its magazine, and could reprint an article from a 1980 edition of
an encyclopedia in a 1990 revision of it; the publisher could not revise the contribution itself or include it in a
new anthology or an entirely different magazine or other collective work.
Transfer of Ownership. The principle of unlimited alienability of copyright is stated in clause (1) of
section 201(d). Under that provision the ownership of a copyright, or of any part of it, may be transferred by
any means of conveyance or by operation of law, and is to be treated as personal property upon the death of
the owner. The term "transfer of copyright ownership" is defined in section 101 to cover any "conveyance,
alienation, or hypothecation," including assignments, mortgages, and exclusive licenses, but not including
nonexclusive licenses. Representatives of motion picture producers have argued that foreclosures of copyright
mortgages should not be left to varying State laws, and that the statute should establish a Federal foreclosure
system. However, the benefits of such a system would be of very limited application, and would not justify the
complicated statutory and procedural requirements that would have to be established.
Clause (2) of subsection (d) contains the first explicit statutory recognition of the principle of divisibility of
copyright in our law. This provision, which has long been sought by authors and their representatives, and
which has attracted wide support from other groups, means that any of the exclusive rights that go to make up
a copyright, including those enumerated in section 106 and any subdivision of them, can be transferred and
[Release Point 118-106]
owned separately. The definition of "transfer of copyright ownership" in section 101 makes clear that the
principle of divisibility applies whether or not the transfer is "limited in time or place of effect," and another
definition in the same section provides that the term "copyright owner," with respect to any one exclusive
right, refers to the owner of that particular right. The last sentence of section 201(d)(2) adds that the owner,
with respect to the particular exclusive right he or she owns, is entitled "to all of the protection and remedies
accorded to the copyright owner by this title." It is thus clear, for example, that a local broadcasting station
holding an exclusive license to transmit a particular work within a particular geographic area and for a
particular period of time, could sue, in its own name as copyright owner, someone who infringed that
particular exclusive right.
Subsection (e) provides that when an individual author's ownership of a copyright, or of any of the
exclusive rights under a copyright, have not previously been voluntarily transferred, no action by any
governmental body or other official or organization purporting to seize, expropriate, transfer, or exercise
rights of ownership with respect to the copyright, or any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, shall be
given effect under this title.
The purpose of this subsection is to reaffirm the basic principle that the United States copyright of an
individual author shall be secured to that author, and cannot be taken away by any involuntary transfer. It is
the intent of the subsection that the author be entitled, despite any purported expropriation or involuntary
transfer, to continue exercising all rights under the United States statute, and that the governmental body or
organization may not enforce or exercise any rights under this title in that situation.
It may sometimes be difficult to ascertain whether a transfer of copyright is voluntary or is coerced by
covert pressure. But subsection (e) would protect foreign authors against laws and decrees purporting to divest
them of their rights under the United States copyright statute, and would protect authors within the foreign
country who choose to resist such covert pressures.
Traditional legal actions that may involve transfer of ownership, such as bankruptcy proceedings and
mortgage foreclosures, are not within the scope of this subsection; the authors in such cases have voluntarily
consented to these legal processes by their overt actions—for example, by filing in bankruptcy or by
hypothecating a copyright.

§202. Ownership of copyright as distinct from ownership of material object
Ownership of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, is distinct from
ownership of any material object in which the work is embodied. Transfer of ownership of any
material object, including the copy or phonorecord in which the work is first fixed, does not of itself
convey any rights in the copyrighted work embodied in the object; nor, in the absence of an
agreement, does transfer of ownership of a copyright or of any exclusive rights under a copyright
convey property rights in any material object.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
The principle restated in section 202 is a fundamental and important one: that copyright ownership and
ownership of a material object in which the copyrighted work is embodied are entirely separate things. Thus,
transfer of a material object does not of itself carry any rights under the copyright, and this includes transfer of
the copy or phonorecord—the original manuscript, the photographic negative, the unique painting or statue,
[Release Point 118-106]
the master tape recording, etc.—in which the work was first fixed. Conversely, transfer of a copyright does
not necessarily require the conveyance of any material object.
As a result of the interaction of this section and the provisions of section 204(a) and 301, the bill would
change a common law doctrine exemplified by the decision in Pushman v. New York Graphic Society, Inc.,
287 N.Y. 302, 39 N.E.2d 249 (1942). Under that doctrine, authors or artists are generally presumed to transfer
common law literary property rights when they sell their manuscript or work of art, unless those rights are
specifically reserved. This presumption would be reversed under the bill, since a specific written conveyance
of rights would be required in order for a sale of any material object to carry with it a transfer of copyright.
§203. Termination of transfers and licenses granted by the author
(a) CONDITIONS FOR TERMINATION.—In the case of any work other than a work made for
hire, the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of copyright or of any right under a
copyright, executed by the author on or after January 1, 1978, otherwise than by will, is subject to
termination under the following conditions:
(1) In the case of a grant executed by one author, termination of the grant may be effected by
that author or, if the author is dead, by the person or persons who, under clause (2) of this
subsection, own and are entitled to exercise a total of more than one-half of that author's
termination interest. In the case of a grant executed by two or more authors of a joint work,
termination of the grant may be effected by a majority of the authors who executed it; if any of
such authors is dead, the termination interest of any such author may be exercised as a unit by the
person or persons who, under clause (2) of this subsection, own and are entitled to exercise a total
of more than one-half of that author's interest.
(2) Where an author is dead, his or her termination interest is owned, and may be exercised, as
follows:
(A) The widow or widower owns the author's entire termination interest unless there are any
surviving children or grandchildren of the author, in which case the widow or widower owns
one-half of the author's interest.
(B) The author's surviving children, and the surviving children of any dead child of the
author, own the author's entire termination interest unless there is a widow or widower, in which
case the ownership of one-half of the author's interest is divided among them.
(C) The rights of the author's children and grandchildren are in all cases divided among them
and exercised on a per stirpes basis according to the number of such author's children
represented; the share of the children of a dead child in a termination interest can be exercised
only by the action of a majority of them.
(D) In the event that the author's widow or widower, children, and grandchildren are not
living, the author's executor, administrator, personal representative, or trustee shall own the
author's entire termination interest.
(3) Termination of the grant may be effected at any time during a period of five years beginning
at the end of thirty-five years from the date of execution of the grant; or, if the grant covers the
right of publication of the work, the period begins at the end of thirty-five years from the date of
publication of the work under the grant or at the end of forty years from the date of execution of
the grant, whichever term ends earlier.
(4) The termination shall be effected by serving an advance notice in writing, signed by the
number and proportion of owners of termination interests required under clauses (1) and (2) of this
subsection, or by their duly authorized agents, upon the grantee or the grantee's successor in title.
(A) The notice shall state the effective date of the termination, which shall fall within the
five-year period specified by clause (3) of this subsection, and the notice shall be served not less
than two or more than ten years before that date. A copy of the notice shall be recorded in the
Copyright Office before the effective date of termination, as a condition to its taking effect.
(B) The notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner of service, with requirements that
the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
[Release Point 118-106]
(5) Termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary,
including an agreement to make a will or to make any future grant.
(b) EFFECT OF TERMINATION.—Upon the effective date of termination, all rights under this
title that were covered by the terminated grants revert to the author, authors, and other persons
owning termination interests under clauses (1) and (2) of subsection (a), including those owners who
did not join in signing the notice of termination under clause (4) of subsection (a), but with the
following limitations:
(1) A derivative work prepared under authority of the grant before its termination may continue
to be utilized under the terms of the grant after its termination, but this privilege does not extend to
the preparation after the termination of other derivative works based upon the copyrighted work
covered by the terminated grant.
(2) The future rights that will revert upon termination of the grant become vested on the date the
notice of termination has been served as provided by clause (4) of subsection (a). The rights vest
in the author, authors, and other persons named in, and in the proportionate shares provided by,
clauses (1) and (2) of subsection (a).
(3) Subject to the provisions of clause (4) of this subsection, a further grant, or agreement to
make a further grant, of any right covered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is signed by the
same number and proportion of the owners, in whom the right has vested under clause (2) of this
subsection, as are required to terminate the grant under clauses (1) and (2) of subsection (a). Such
further grant or agreement is effective with respect to all of the persons in whom the right it covers
has vested under clause (2) of this subsection, including those who did not join in signing it. If any
person dies after rights under a terminated grant have vested in him or her, that person's legal
representatives, legatees, or heirs at law represent him or her for purposes of this clause.
(4) A further grant, or agreement to make a further grant, of any right covered by a terminated
grant is valid only if it is made after the effective date of the termination. As an exception,
however, an agreement for such a further grant may be made between the persons provided by
clause (3) of this subsection and the original grantee or such grantee's successor in title, after the
notice of termination has been served as provided by clause (4) of subsection (a).
(5) Termination of a grant under this section affects only those rights covered by the grants that
arise under this title, and in no way affects rights arising under any other Federal, State, or foreign
laws.
(6) Unless and until termination is effected under this section, the grant, if it does not provide
otherwise, continues in effect for the term of copyright provided by this title.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
The Problem in General. The provisions of section 203 are based on the premise that the reversionary
provisions of the present section on copyright renewal (17 U.S.C. sec. 24 [section 24 of former title 17])
should be eliminated, and that the proposed law should substitute for them a provision safeguarding authors
against unremunerative transfers. A provision of this sort is needed because of the unequal bargaining position
of authors, resulting in part from the impossibility of determining a work's value until it has been exploited.
Section 203 reflects a practical compromise that will further the objectives of the copyright law while
recognizing the problems and legitimate needs of all interests involved.
Scope of the Provision. Instead of being automatic, as is theoretically the case under the present renewal
provision, the termination of a transfer or license under section 203 would require the serving of an advance
notice within specified time limits and under specified conditions. However, although affirmative action is
needed to effect a termination, the right to take this action cannot be waived in advance or contracted away.
Under section 203(a) the right of termination would apply only to transfers and licenses executed after the
effective date of the new statute [Jan. 1, 1978], and would have no retroactive effect.
The right of termination would be confined to inter vivos transfers or licenses executed by the author, and
[Release Point 118-106]
would not apply to transfers by the author's successors in interest or to the author's own bequests. The scope of
the right would extend not only to any "transfer of copyright ownership," as defined in section 101, but also to
nonexclusive licenses. The right of termination would not apply to "works made for hire," which is one of the
principal reasons the definition of that term assumed importance in the development of the bill.
Who Can Terminate a Grant. Two issues emerged from the disputes over section 203 as to the persons
empowered to terminate a grant: (1) the specific classes of beneficiaries in the case of joint works; and (2)
whether anything less than unanimous consent of all those entitled to terminate should be required to make a
termination effective. The bill to some extent reflects a compromise on these points, including a recognition of
the dangers of one or more beneficiaries being induced to "hold out" and of unknown children or
grandchildren being discovered later. The provision can be summarized as follows:
1. In the case of a work of joint authorship, where the grant was signed by two or more of the authors,
majority action by those who signed the grant, or by their interests, would be required to terminate it.
2. There are three different situations in which the shares of joint authors, or of a dead author's widow
or widower, children, and grandchildren, must be divided under the statute: (1) The right to effect a
termination; (2) the ownership of the terminated rights; and (3) the right to make further grants of reverted
rights. The respective shares of the authors, and of a dead author's widow or widower, children, and
grandchildren, would be divided in exactly the same way in each of these situations. The terms "widow,"
"widower," and "children" are defined in section 101 in an effort to avoid problems and uncertainties that
have arisen under the present renewal section.
3. The principle of per stirpes representation would also be applied in exactly the same way in all three
situations. Take for example, a case where a dead author left a widow, two living children, and three
grandchildren by a third child who is dead. The widow will own half of the reverted interests, the two
children will each own 162/3 percent, and the three grandchildren will each own a share of roughly 5½
percent. But who can exercise the right of termination? Obviously, since she owns 50 percent, the widow is
an essential party, but suppose neither of the two surviving children is willing to join her in the termination;
is it enough that she gets one of the children of the dead child to join, or can the dead child's interest be
exercised only by the action of a majority of his children? Consistent with the per stirpes principle, the
interest of a dead child can be exercised only as a unit by majority action of his surviving children. Thus,
even though the widow and one grandchild would own 55½ percent of the reverted copyright, they would
have to be joined by another child or grandchild in order to effect a termination or a further transfer of
reverted rights. This principle also applies where, for example, two joint authors executed a grant and one
of them is dead; in order to effect a termination, the living author must be joined by a per stirpes majority of
the dead author's beneficiaries. The notice of termination may be signed by the specified owners of
termination interests or by "their duly authorized agents," which would include the legally appointed
guardians or committees of persons incompetent to sign because of age or mental disability.
When a Grant Can be Terminated. Section 203 draws a distinction between the date when a termination
becomes effective and the earlier date when the advance notice of termination is served. With respect to the
ultimate effective date, section 203(a)(3) provides, as a general rule, that a grant may be terminated during the
5 years following the expiration of a period of 35 years from the execution of the grant. As an exception to
this basic 35-year rule, the bill also provides that "if the grant covers the right of publication of the work, the
period begins at the end of 35 years from the date of publication of the work under the grant or at the end of
40 years from the date of execution of the grant, whichever term ends earlier." This alternative method of
computation is intended to cover cases where years elapse between the signing of a publication contract and
the eventual publication of the work.
The effective date of termination, which must be stated in the advance notice, is required to fall within the 5
years following the end of the applicable 35- or 40-year period, but the advance notice itself must be served
earlier. Under section 203(a)(4)(A), the notice must be served "not less than two or more than ten years"
before the effective date stated in it.
As an example of how these time-limit requirements would operate in practice, we suggest two typical
contract situations:
Case 1: Contract for theatrical production signed on September 2, 1987. Termination of grant can be made
to take effect between September 2, 2022 (35 years from execution) and September 1, 2027 (end of 5 year
termination period). Assuming that the author decides to terminate on September 1, 2022 (the earliest possible
date) the advance notice must be filed between September 1, 2012, and September 1, 2020.
Case 2: Contract for book publication executed on April 10, 1980; book finally published on August 23,
1987. Since contract covers the right of publication, the 5-year termination period would begin on April 10,
2020 (40 years from execution) rather than April 10, 2015 (35 years from execution) or August 23, 2022 (35
[Release Point 118-106]
years from publication). Assuming that the author decides to make the termination effective on January 1,
2024, the advance notice would have to be served between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2022.
Effect of Termination. Section 203(b) makes clear that, unless effectively terminated within the applicable
5-year period, all rights covered by an existing grant will continue unchanged, and that rights under other
Federal, State, or foreign laws are unaffected. However, assuming that a copyright transfer or license is
terminated under section 203, who are bound by the termination and how are they affected?
Under the bill, termination means that ownership of the rights covered by the terminated grant reverts to
everyone who owns termination interests on the date the notice of termination was served, whether they joined
in signing the notice or not. In other words, if a person could have signed the notice, that person is bound by
the action of the majority who did; the termination of the grant will be effective as to that person, and a
proportionate share of the reverted rights automatically vests in that person. Ownership is divided
proportionately on the same per stirpes basis as that provided for the right to effect termination under section
203(a) and, since the reverted rights vest on the date notice is served, the heirs of a dead beneficiary would
inherit his or her share.
Under clause (3) of subsection (b), majority action is required to make a further grant of reverted rights. A
problem here, of course, is that years may have passed between the time the reverted rights vested and the
time the new owners want to make a further transfer; people may have died and children may have been born
in the interim. To deal with this problem, the bill looks back to the date of vesting; out of the group in whom
rights vested on that date, it requires the further transfer or license to be signed by "the same number and
proportion of the owners" (though not necessarily the same individuals) as were then required to terminate the
grant under subsection (a). If some of those in whom the rights originally vested have died, their "legal
representatives, legatees, or heirs at law" may represent them for this purpose and, as in the case of the
termination itself, any one of the minority who does not join in the further grant is nevertheless bound by it.
An important limitation on the rights of a copyright owner under a terminated grant is specified in section
203(b)(1). This clause provides that, notwithstanding a termination, a derivative work prepared earlier may
"continue to be utilized" under the conditions of the terminated grant; the clause adds, however, that this
privilege is not broad enough to permit the preparation of other derivative works. In other words, a film made
from a play could continue to be licensed for performance after the motion picture contract had been
terminated but any remake rights covered by the contract would be cut off. For this purpose, a motion picture
would be considered as a "derivative work" with respect to every "preexisting work" incorporated in it,
whether the preexisting work was created independently or was prepared expressly for the motion picture.
Section 203 would not prevent the parties to a transfer or license from voluntarily agreeing at any time to
terminate an existing grant and negotiating a new one, thereby causing another 35-year period to start running.
However, the bill seeks to avoid the situation that has arisen under the present renewal provision, in which
third parties have bought up contingent future interests as a form of speculation. Section 203(b)(4) would
make a further grant of rights that revert under a terminated grant valid "only if it is made after the effective
date of the termination." An exception, in the nature of a right of "first refusal," would permit the original
grantee or a successor of such grantee to negotiate a new agreement with the persons effecting the termination
at any time after the notice of termination has been served.
Nothing contained in this section or elsewhere in this legislation is intended to extend the duration of any
license, transfer or assignment made for a period of less than thirty-five years. If, for example, an agreement
provides an earlier termination date or lesser duration, or if it allows the author the right of cancelling or
terminating the agreement under certain circumstances, the duration is governed by the agreement. Likewise,
nothing in this section or legislation is intended to change the existing state of the law of contracts concerning
the circumstances in which an author may cancel or terminate a license, transfer, or assignment.
Section 203(b)(6) provides that, unless and until termination is effected under this section, the grant, "if it
does not provide otherwise," continues for the term of copyright. This section means that, if the agreement
does not contain provisions specifying its term or duration, and the author has not terminated the agreement
under this section, the agreement continues for the term of the copyright, subject to any right of termination
under circumstances which may be specified therein. If, however, an agreement does contain provisions
governing its duration—for example, a term of fifty years—and the author has not exercised his or her right of
termination under the statute, the agreement will continue according to its terms—in this example, for only
fifty years. The quoted language is not to be construed as requiring agreements to reserve the right of
termination.

HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Section 204 is a somewhat broadened and liberalized counterpart of sections 28 and 29 of the present
statute [sections 28 and 29 of former title 17]. Under subsection (a), a transfer of copyright ownership (other
than one brought about by operation of law) is valid only if there exists an instrument of conveyance, or
alternatively a "note or memorandum of the transfer," which is in writing and signed by the copyright owner
"or such owner's duly authorized agent." Subsection (b) makes clear that a notarial or consular
acknowledgment is not essential to the validity of any transfer, whether executed in the United States or
abroad. However, the subsection would liberalize the conditions under which certificates of acknowledgment
of documents executed abroad are to be accorded prima facie weight, and would give the same weight to
domestic acknowledgments under appropriate circumstances.
§205. Recordation of transfers and other documents
(a) CONDITIONS FOR RECORDATION.—Any transfer of copyright ownership or other
document pertaining to a copyright may be recorded in the Copyright Office if the document filed
for recordation bears the actual signature of the person who executed it, or if it is accompanied by a
sworn or official certification that it is a true copy of the original, signed document. A sworn or
official certification may be submitted to the Copyright Office electronically, pursuant to regulations
established by the Register of Copyrights.
(b) CERTIFICATE OF RECORDATION.—The Register of Copyrights shall, upon receipt of a
document as provided by subsection (a) and of the fee provided by section 708, record the document
and return it with a certificate of recordation.
(c) RECORDATION AS CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE.—Recordation of a document in the
Copyright Office gives all persons constructive notice of the facts stated in the recorded document,
but only if—
(1) the document, or material attached to it, specifically identifies the work to which it pertains
so that, after the document is indexed by the Register of Copyrights, it would be revealed by a
reasonable search under the title or registration number of the work; and
(2) registration has been made for the work.
(d) PRIORITY BETWEEN CONFLICTING TRANSFERS.—As between two conflicting
transfers, the one executed first prevails if it is recorded, in the manner required to give constructive
[Release Point 118-106]
notice under subsection (c), within one month after its execution in the United States or within two
months after its execution outside the United States, or at any time before recordation in such manner
of the later transfer. Otherwise the later transfer prevails if recorded first in such manner, and if taken
in good faith, for valuable consideration or on the basis of a binding promise to pay royalties, and
without notice of the earlier transfer.
(e) PRIORITY BETWEEN CONFLICTING TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP AND
NONEXCLUSIVE LICENSE.—A nonexclusive license, whether recorded or not, prevails over a
conflicting transfer of copyright ownership if the license is evidenced by a written instrument signed
by the owner of the rights licensed or such owner's duly authorized agent, and if—
(1) the license was taken before execution of the transfer; or
(2) the license was taken in good faith before recordation of the transfer and without notice of it.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
The recording and priority provisions of section 205 are intended to clear up a number of uncertainties
arising from sections 30 and 31 of the present law [sections 30 and 31 of former title 17] and to make them
more effective and practical in operation. Any "document pertaining to a copyright" may be recorded under
subsection (a) if it "bears that actual signature of the person who executed it," or if it is appropriately certified
as a true copy. However, subsection (c) makes clear that the recorded document will give constructive notice
of its contents only if two conditions are met: (1) the document or attached material specifically identifies the
work to which it pertains so that a reasonable search under the title or registration number would reveal it, and
(2) registration has been made for the work. Moreover, even though the Register of Copyrights may be
compelled to accept for recordation documents that on their face appear self-serving or colorable, the Register
should take care that their nature is not concealed from the public in the Copyright Office's indexing and
search reports.
The provisions of subsection (d), requiring recordation of transfers as a prerequisite to the institution of an
infringement suit, represent a desirable change in the law. The one- and three-month grace periods provided in
subsection (e) are a reasonable compromise between those who want a longer hiatus and those who argue that
any grace period makes it impossible for a bona fide transferee to rely on the record at any particular time.
Under subsection (f) of section 205, a nonexclusive license in writing and signed, whether recorded or not,
would be valid against a later transfer, and would also prevail as against a prior unrecorded transfer if taken in
good faith and without notice. Objections were raised by motion picture producers, particularly to the
provision allowing unrecorded nonexclusive licenses to prevail over subsequent transfers, on the ground that a
nonexclusive license can have drastic effects on the value of a copyright. On the other hand, the
impracticalities and burdens that would accompany any requirement of recordation of nonexclusive licenses
outweigh the limited advantages of a statutory recordation system for them.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Single Federal System. Section 301, one of the bedrock provisions of the bill, would accomplish a
fundamental and significant change in the present law. Instead of a dual system of "common law copyright"
for unpublished works and statutory copyright for published works, which has been the system in effect in the
United States since the first copyright statute in 1790, the bill adopts a single system of Federal statutory
copyright from creation. Under section 301 a work would obtain statutory protection as soon as it is "created"
or, as that term is defined in section 101 when it is "fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first time."
Common law copyright protection for works coming within the scope of the statute would be abrogated, and
the concept of publication would lose its all-embracing importance as a dividing line between common law
and statutory protection and between both of these forms of legal protection and the public domain.
By substituting a single Federal system for the present anachronistic, uncertain, impractical, and highly
complicated dual system, the bill would greatly improve the operation of the copyright law and would be
much more effective in carrying out the basic constitutional aims of uniformity and the promotion of writing
and scholarship. The main arguments in favor of a single Federal system can be summarized as follows:
1. One of the fundamental purposes behind the copyright clause of the Constitution, as shown in
Madison's comments in The Federalist, was to promote national uniformity and to avoid the practical
difficulties of determining and enforcing an author's rights under the differing laws and in the separate
[Release Point 118-106]
courts of the various States. Today when the methods for dissemination of an author's work are
incomparably broader and faster than they were in 1789, national uniformity in copyright protection is even
more essential than it was then to carry out the constitutional intent.
2. "Publication," perhaps the most important single concept under the present law, also represents its
most serious defect. Although at one time when works were disseminated almost exclusively through
printed copies, "publication" could serve as a practical dividing line between common law and statutory
protection, this is no longer true. With the development of the 20th-century communications revolution, the
concept of publication has become increasingly artificial and obscure. To cope with the legal consequences
of an established concept that has lost much of its meaning and justification, the courts have given
"publication" a number of diverse interpretations, some of them radically different. Not unexpectedly, the
results in individual cases have become unpredictable and often unfair. A single Federal system would help
to clear up this chaotic situation.
3. Enactment of section 301 would also implement the "limited times" provision of the Constitution
[Const. Art. I, §8, cl. 8], which has become distorted under the traditional concept of "publication."
Common law protection in "unpublished" works is now perpetual, no matter how widely they may be
disseminated by means other than "publication"; the bill would place a time limit on the duration of
exclusive rights in them. The provision would also aid scholarship and the dissemination of historical
materials by making unpublished, undisseminated manuscripts available for publication after a reasonable
period.
4. Adoption of a uniform national copyright system would greatly improve international dealings in
copyrighted material. No other country has anything like our present dual system. In an era when
copyrighted works can be disseminated instantaneously to every country on the globe, the need for effective
international copyright relations, and the concomitant need for national uniformity, assume ever greater
importance.
Under section 301, the statute would apply to all works created after its effective date [Jan 1, 1978],
whether or not they are ever published or disseminated. With respect to works created before the effective date
of the statute [Jan. 1, 1978] and still under common law protection, section 303 of the statute would provide
protection from that date on, and would guarantee a minimum period of statutory copyright.
Preemption of State Law. The intention of section 301 is to preempt and abolish any rights under the
common law or statutes of a State that are equivalent to copyright and that extend to works coming within the
scope of the Federal copyright law. The declaration of this principle in section 301 is intended to be stated in
the clearest and most unequivocal language possible, so as to foreclose any conceivable misinterpretation of
its unqualified intention that Congress shall act preemptively, and to avoid the development of any vague
borderline areas between State and Federal protection.
Under section 301(a) all "legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within
the general scope of copyright as specified by section 106" are governed exclusively by the Federal copyright
statute if the works involved are "works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression and
come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by sections 102 and 103." All corresponding State
laws, whether common law or statutory, are preempted and abrogated. Regardless of when the work was
created and whether it is published or unpublished, disseminated or undisseminated, in the public domain or
copyrighted under the Federal statute, the States cannot offer it protection equivalent to copyright. Section
1338 of title 28, United States Code, also makes clear that any action involving rights under the Federal
copyright law would come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal courts. The preemptive effect of
section 301 is limited to State laws; as stated expressly in subsection (d) of section 301, there is no intention to
deal with the question of whether Congress can or should offer the equivalent of copyright protection under
some constitutional provision other than the patent-copyright clause of article 1, section 8 [Const. Art. I, §8,
cl. 8].
As long as a work fits within one of the general subject matter categories of sections 102 and 103, the bill
prevents the States from protecting it even if it fails to achieve Federal statutory copyright because it is too
minimal or lacking in originality to qualify, or because it has fallen into the public domain. On the other hand
section 301(b) explicitly preserves common law copyright protection for one important class of works: works
that have not been "fixed in any tangible medium of expression." Examples would include choreography that
has never been filmed or notated, an extemporaneous speech, "original works of authorship" communicated
solely through conversations or live broadcasts, and a dramatic sketch or musical composition improvised or
developed from memory and without being recorded or written down. As mentioned above in connection with
section 102, unfixed works are not included in the specified "subject matter of copyright." They are therefore
not affected by the preemption of section 301, and would continue to be subject to protection under State
statute or common law until fixed in tangible form.
[Release Point 118-106]
The preemption of rights under State law is complete with respect to any work coming within the scope of
the bill, even though the scope of exclusive rights given the work under the bill is narrower than the scope of
common law rights in the work might have been.
Representatives of printers, while not opposed to the principle of section 301, expressed concern about its
potential impact on protection of preliminary advertising copy and layouts prepared by printers. They argued
that this material is frequently "pirated" by competitors, and that it would be a substantial burden if, in order to
obtain full protection, the printer would have to make registrations and bear the expense and bother of suing in
Federal rather than State courts. On the other hand, these practical problems are essentially procedural rather
than substantive, and the proposal for a special exemption to preserve common law rights equivalent to
copyright in unpublished advertising material cannot be justified. Moreover, subsection (b), discussed below,
will preserve other legal grounds on which the printers can protect themselves against "pirates" under State
laws.
In a general way subsection (b) of section 301 represents the obverse of subsection (a). It sets out, in broad
terms and without necessarily being exhaustive, some of the principal areas of protection that preemption
would not prevent the States from protecting. Its purpose is to make clear, consistent with the 1964 Supreme
Court decisions in Sears, Roebuck & Co., v. Stiffel Co., 376 U.S. 225 [84 S.Ct. 784, 11 L.Ed.2d 661, rehearing
denied 84 S.Ct. 1131, 376 U.S. 973, 12 L.Ed.2d 87], and Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U.S.
234 [84 S.Ct. 779, 11 L.Ed.2d 669, rehearing denied 84 S.Ct. 1162, 377 U.S. 913, 12 L.Ed.2d 183], that
preemption does not extend to causes of action, or subject matter outside the scope of the revised Federal
copyright statute.
The numbered clauses of subsection (b) list three general areas left unaffected by the preemption: (1)
subject matter that does not come within the subject matter of copyright; (2) causes of action arising under
State law before the effective date of the statute [Jan. 1, 1978]; and (3) violations of rights that are not
equivalent to any of the exclusive rights under copyright.
The examples in clause (3), while not exhaustive, are intended to illustrate rights and remedies that are
different in nature from the rights comprised in a copyright and that may continue to be protected under State
common law or statute. The evolving common law rights of "privacy," "publicity," and trade secrets, and the
general laws of defamation and fraud, would remain unaffected as long as the causes of action contain
elements, such as an invasion of personal rights or a breach of trust or confidentiality, that are different in kind
from copyright infringement. Nothing in the bill derogates from the rights of parties to contract with each
other and to sue for breaches of contract; however, to the extent that the unfair competition concept known as
"interference with contract relations" is merely the equivalent of copyright protection, it would be preempted.
The last example listed in clause (3)—"deceptive trade practices such as passing off and false
representation"—represents an effort to distinguish between those causes of action known as "unfair
competition" that the copyright statute is not intended to preempt and those that it is. Section 301 is not
intended to preempt common law protection in cases involving activities such as false labeling, fraudulent
representation, and passing off even where the subject matter involved comes within the scope of the
copyright statute.
"Misappropriation" is not necessarily synonymous with copyright infringement, and thus a cause of action
labeled as "misappropriation" is not preempted if it is fact based neither on a right within the general scope of
copyright as specified by section 106 nor on a right equivalent thereto. For example, state law should have the
flexibility to afford a remedy (under traditional principles of equity) against a consistent pattern of
unauthorized appropriation by a competitor of the facts (i.e., not the literary expression) constituting "hot"
news, whether in the traditional mold of International News Service v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215 (1918)
[39 S.Ct. 68, 63 L.Ed. 211], or in the newer form of data updates from scientific, business, or financial data
bases. Likewise, a person having no trust or other relationship with the proprietor of a computerized data base
should not be immunized from sanctions against electronically or cryptographically breaching the proprietor's
security arrangements and accessing the proprietor's data. The unauthorized data access which should be
remediable might also be achieved by the intentional interception of data transmissions by wire, microwave or
laser transmissions, or by the common unintentional means of "crossed" telephone lines occasioned by errors
in switching.
The proprietor of data displayed on the cathode ray tube of a computer terminal should be afforded
protection against unauthorized printouts by third parties (with or without improper access), even if the data
are not copyrightable. For example, the data may not be copyrighted because they are not fixed in a tangible
medium of expression (i.e., the data are not displayed for a period or not more than transitory duration).
Nothing contained in section 301 precludes the owner of a material embodiment of a copy or a phonorecord
from enforcing a claim of conversion against one who takes possession of the copy or phonorecord without
consent.
[Release Point 118-106]
A unique and difficult problem is presented with respect to the status of sound recordings fixed before
February 12, 1972, the effective date of the amendment bringing recordings fixed after that date under Federal
copyright protection. In its testimony during the 1975 hearings, the Department of Justice pointed out that,
under section 301 as then written:
This language could be read as abrogating the anti-piracy laws now existing in 29 states relating to
pre-February 15, 1972, sound recordings on the grounds that these statutes proscribe activities violating
rights equivalent to * * * the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright. * * * Certainly such a
result cannot have been intended for it would likely effect the immediate resurgence of piracy of
pre-February 15, 1972, sound recordings.
The Department recommended that section 301(b) be amended to exclude sound recordings fixed prior to
February 15, 1972 from the effect of the preemption.
The Senate adopted this suggestion when it passed S. 22. The result of the Senate amendment would be to
leave pre-1972 sound recordings as entitled to perpetual protection under State law, while post-1972
recordings would eventually fall into the public domain as provided in the bill.
The Committee recognizes that, under recent court decisions, pre-1972 recordings are protected by State
statute or common law, and that should not all be thrown into the public domain instantly upon the coming
into effect of the new law. However, it cannot agree that they should in effect be accorded perpetual
protection, as under the Senate amendment, and it has therefore revised clause (4) to establish a future date for
the pre-emption to take effect. The date chosen is February 15, 2047 which is 75 years from the effective date
of the statute extending Federal protection to recordings.
Subsection (c) makes clear that nothing contained in Title 17 annuls or limits any rights or remedies under
any other Federal statute.

§302. Duration of copyright: Works created on or after January 1, 1978
(a) IN GENERAL.—Copyright in a work created on or after January 1, 1978, subsists from its
creation and, except as provided by the following subsections, endures for a term consisting of the
life of the author and 70 years after the author's death.
(b) JOINT WORKS.—In the case of a joint work prepared by two or more authors who did not
work for hire, the copyright endures for a term consisting of the life of the last surviving author and
70 years after such last surviving author's death.
(c) ANONYMOUS WORKS, PSEUDONYMOUS WORKS, AND WORKS MADE FOR HIRE
.—In the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made for hire, the copyright
endures for a term of 95 years from the year of its first publication, or a term of 120 years from the
year of its creation, whichever expires first. If, before the end of such term, the identity of one or
more of the authors of an anonymous or pseudonymous work is revealed in the records of a
registration made for that work under subsections (a) or (d) of section 408, or in the records provided
by this subsection, the copyright in the work endures for the term specified by subsection (a) or (b),
based on the life of the author or authors whose identity has been revealed. Any person having an
interest in the copyright in an anonymous or pseudonymous work may at any time record, in records
to be maintained by the Copyright Office for that purpose, a statement identifying one or more
authors of the work; the statement shall also identify the person filing it, the nature of that person's
interest, the source of the information recorded, and the particular work affected, and shall comply in
form and content with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
(d) RECORDS RELATING TO DEATH OF AUTHORS.—Any person having an interest in a
copyright may at any time record in the Copyright Office a statement of the date of death of the
author of the copyrighted work, or a statement that the author is still living on a particular date. The
statement shall identify the person filing it, the nature of that person's interest, and the source of the
information recorded, and shall comply in form and content with requirements that the Register of
Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation. The Register shall maintain current records of information
relating to the death of authors of copyrighted works, based on such recorded statements and, to the
extent the Register considers practicable, on data contained in any of the records of the Copyright
Office or in other reference sources.
(e) PRESUMPTION AS TO AUTHOR'S DEATH.—After a period of 95 years from the year of
first publication of a work, or a period of 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever expires
first, any person who obtains from the Copyright Office a certified report that the records provided
by subsection (d) disclose nothing to indicate that the author of the work is living, or died less than
70 years before, is entitled to the benefits of a presumption that the author has been dead for at least
70 years. Reliance in good faith upon this presumption shall be a complete defense to any action for
infringement under this title.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
In General. The debate over how long a copyright should last is as old as the oldest copyright statute and
will doubtless continue as long as there is a copyright law. With certain exceptions, there appears to be strong
support for the principle, as embodied in the bill, of a copyright term consisting of the life of the author and 50
years after his death. In particular, the authors and their representatives stressed that the adoption of a
life-plus-50 term was by far their most important legislative goal in copyright law revision. The Register of
Copyrights now regards a life-plus-50 term as the foundation of the entire bill.
Under the present law statutory copyright protection begins on the date of publication (or on the date of
registration in unpublished form) and continues for 28 years from that date; it may be renewed for a second 28
[Release Point 118-106]
years, making a total potential term of 56 years in all cases. [Under Public Laws 87–668, 89–142, 90–141,
90–416, 91–147, 91–555, 92–170, 92–566, and 93–573, copyrights that were subsisting in their renewal term
on September 19, 1962, and that were scheduled to expire before Dec. 31, 1976, have been extended to that
later date, in anticipation that general revision legislation extending their terms still further will be enacted by
then.] The principal elements of this system—a definite number of years, computed from either publication or
registration, with a renewal feature—have been a part of the U.S. copyright law since the first statute in 1790.
The arguments for changing this system to one based on the life of the author can be summarized as follows:
1. The present 56-year term is not long enough to insure an author and his dependents the fair
economic benefits from his works. Life expectancy has increased substantially, and more and more authors
are seeing their works fall into the public domain during their lifetimes, forcing later works to compete with
their own early works in which copyright has expired.
2. The tremendous growth in communications media has substantially lengthened the commercial life
of a great many works. A short term is particularly discriminatory against serious works of music, literature,
and art, whose value may not be recognized until after many years.
3. Although limitations on the term of copyright are obviously necessary, too short a term harms the
author without giving any substantial benefit to the public. The public frequently pays the same for works in
the public domain as it does for copyrighted works, and the only result is a commercial windfall to certain
users at the author's expense. In some cases the lack of copyright protection actually restrains dissemination
of the work, since publishers and other users cannot risk investing in the work unless assured of exclusive
rights.
4. A system based on the life of the author would go a long way toward clearing up the confusion and
uncertainty involved in the vague concept of "publication," and would provide a much simpler, clearer
method for computing the term. The death of the author is a definite, determinable event, and it would be
the only date that a potential user would have to worry about. All of a particular author's works, including
successive revisions of them, would fall into the public domain at the same time, thus avoiding the present
problems of determining a multitude of publication dates and of distinguishing "old" and "new" matter in
later editions. The bill answers the problems of determining when relatively obscure authors died, by
establishing a registry of death dates and a system of presumptions.
5. One of the worst features of the present copyright law is the provision for renewal of copyright. A
substantial burden and expense, this unclear and highly technical requirement results in incalculable
amounts of unproductive work. In a number of cases it is the cause of inadvertent and unjust loss of
copyright. Under a life-plus-50 system the renewal device would be inappropriate and unnecessary.
6. Under the preemption provisions of section 301 and the single Federal system they would establish,
authors will be giving up perpetual, unlimited exclusive common law rights in their unpublished works,
including works that have been widely disseminated by means other than publication. A statutory term of
life-plus-50 years is no more than a fair recompense for the loss of these perpetual rights.
7. A very large majority of the world's countries have adopted a copyright term of the life of the author
and 50 years after the author's death. Since American authors are frequently protected longer in foreign
countries than in the United States, the disparity in the duration of copyright has provoked considerable
resentment and some proposals for retaliatory legislation. Copyrighted works move across national borders
faster and more easily than virtually any other economic commodity, and with the techniques now in
common use this movement has in many cases become instantaneous and effortless. The need to conform
the duration of U.S. copyright to that prevalent throughout the rest of the world is increasingly pressing in
order to provide certainty and simplicity in international business dealings. Even more important, a change
in the basis of our copyright term would place the United States in the forefront of the international
copyright community. Without this change, the possibility of future United States adherence to the Berne
Copyright Union would evaporate, but with it would come a great and immediate improvement in our
copyright relations. All of these benefits would accrue directly to American and foreign authors alike.
The need for a longer total term of copyright has been conclusively demonstrated. It is true that a major
reason for the striking statistical increase in life expectancy since 1909 is the reduction in infant mortality, but
this does not mean that the increase can be discounted. Although not nearly as great as the total increase in life
expectancy, there has been a marked increase in longevity, and with medical discoveries and health programs
for the elderly this trend shows every indication of continuing. If life expectancy in 1909, which was in the
neighborhood of 56 years, offered a rough guide to the length of copyright protection, then life expectancy in
the 1970's which is well over 70 years, should offer a similar guide; the Register's 1961 Report included
statistics indicating that something between 70 and 76 years was then the average equivalent of life-plus-50
years. A copyright should extend beyond the author's lifetime, and judged by this standard the present term of
56 years is too short.
[Release Point 118-106]
The arguments as to the benefits of uniformity with foreign laws, and the advantages of international
comity that would result from adoption of a life-plus-50 term, are also highly significant. The system has
worked well in other countries, and on the whole it would appear to make computation of terms considerably
simpler and easier. The registry of death dates and the system of presumptions established in section 302
would solve most of the problems in determining when an individual author died.
No country in the world has provisions on the duration of copyright like ours. Virtually every other
copyright law in the world bases the term of protection for works by natural persons on the life of the author,
and a substantial majority of these accord protection for 50 years after the author's death. This term is required
for adherence to the Berne Convention. It is worth noting that the 1965 revision of the copyright law of the
Federal Republic of Germany adopted a term of life plus 70 years.
A point that has concerned some educational groups arose from the possibility that, since a large majority
(now about 85 percent) of all copyrighted works are not renewed, a life-plus-50 year term would tie up a
substantial body of material that is probably of no commercial interest but that would be more readily
available for scholarly use if free of copyright restrictions. A statistical study of renewal registrations made by
the Copyright Office in 1966 supports the generalization that most material which is considered to be of
continuing or potential commercial value is renewed. Of the remainder, a certain proportion is of practically
no value to anyone, but there are a large number of unrenewed works that have scholarly value to historians,
archivists, and specialists in a variety of fields. This consideration lay behind the proposals for retaining the
renewal device or for limiting the term for unpublished or unregistered works.
It is true that today's ephemera represent tomorrow's social history, and that works of scholarly value, which
are now falling into the public domain after 28 years, would be protected much longer under the bill. Balanced
against this are the burdens and expenses of renewals, the near impossibility of distinguishing between types
of works in fixing a statutory term, and the extremely strong case in favor of a life-plus-50 system. Moreover,
it is important to realize that the bill would not restrain scholars from using any work as source material or
from making "fair use" of it; the restrictions would extend only to the unauthorized reproduction or
distribution of copies of the work, its public performance, or some other use that would actually infringe the
copyright owner's exclusive rights. The advantages of a basic term of copyright enduring for the life of the
author and for 50 years after the author's death outweigh any possible disadvantages.
Basic Copyright Term. Under subsection (a) of section 302, a work "created" on or after the effective date
of the revised statute [Jan. 1, 1978] would be protected by statutory copyright "from its creation" and, with
exceptions to be noted below, "endures for a term consisting of the life of the author and 50 years after the
author's death."
Under this provision, as a general rule, the life-plus-50 term would apply equally to unpublished works, to
works published during the author's lifetime, and to works published posthumously.
The definition of "created" in section 101, which will be discussed in more detail in connection with section
302(c) below, makes clear that "creation" for this purpose means the first time the work is fixed in a copy or
phonorecord; up to that point the work is not "created," and is subject to common law protection, even though
it may exist in someone's mind and may have been communicated to others in unfixed form.
Joint Works. Since by definition a "joint work" has two or more authors, a statute basing the term of
copyright on the life of the author must provide a special method of computing the term of "joint works."
Under the system in effect in many foreign countries, the term of copyright is measured from the death of the
last survivor of a group of joint authors, no matter how many there are. The bill adopts this system as the
simplest and fairest of the alternatives for dealing with the problem.
Anonymous Works, Pseudonymous Works, and Works Made for Hire. Computing the term from the
author's death also requires special provisions to deal with cases where the authorship is not revealed or where
the "author" is not an individual. Section 302(c) therefore provides a special term for anonymous works,
pseudonymous works, and works made for hire: 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation,
whichever is shorter. The definitions in section 101 make the status of anonymous and pseudonymous works
depend on what is revealed on the copies or phonorecords of a work; a work is "anonymous" if "no natural
person is identified as author," and is "pseudonymous" if "the author is identified under a fictitious name."
Section 302(c) provides that the 75- and 100-year terms for an anonymous or pseudonymous work can be
converted to the ordinary life-plus-50 term if "the identity of one or more authors * * * is revealed" in special
records maintained for this purpose in the Copyright Office. The term in such cases would be "based on the
life of the author or authors whose identity has been revealed." Instead of forcing a user to search through
countless Copyright Office records to determine if an author's identity has been revealed, the bill sets up a
special registry for the purpose, with requirements concerning the filing of identifying statements that parallel
those of the following subsection (d) with respect to statements of the date of an author's death.
The alternative terms established in section 302(c)—75 years from publication or 100 years from creation,
[Release Point 118-106]
whichever expires first—are necessary to set a time limit on protection of unpublished material. For example,
copyright in a work created in 1978 and published in 1988 would expire in 2063 (75 years from publication).
A question arises as to when the copyright should expire if the work is never published. Both the Constitution
and the underlying purposes of the bill require the establishment of an alternative term for unpublished work
and the only practicable basis for this alternative is "creation." Under the bill a work created in 1980 but not
published until after 2005 (or never published) would fall into the public domain in 2080 (100 years after
creation).
The definition in section 101 provides that "creation" takes place when a work "is fixed in a copy or
phonorecord for the first time." Although the concept of "creation" is inherently lacking in precision, its
adoption in the bill would, for example, enable a scholar to use an unpublished manuscript written
anonymously, pseudonymously, or for hire, if he determines on the basis of internal or external evidence that
the manuscript is at least 100 years old. In the case of works written over a period of time or in successive
revised versions, the definition provides that the portion of the work "that has been fixed at any particular time
constitutes the work as of that time," and that, "where the work has been prepared in different versions, each
version constitutes a separate work." Thus, a scholar or other user, in attempting to determine whether a
particular work is in the public domain, needs to look no further than the particular version he wishes to use.
Although "publication" would no longer play the central role assigned to it under the present law, the
concept would still have substantial significance under provisions throughout the bill, including those on
Federal preemption and duration. Under the definition in section 101, a work is "published" if one or more
copies or phonorecords embodying it are distributed to the public—that is, generally to persons under no
explicit or implicit restrictions with respect to disclosure of its contents—without regard to the manner in
which the copies or phonorecords changed hands. The definition clears up the question of whether the sale of
phonorecords constitutes publication, and it also makes plain that any form or dissemination in which a
material object does not change hands—performances or displays on television, for example—is not a
publication no matter how many people are exposed to the work. On the other hand, the definition also makes
clear that, when copies or phonorecords are offered to a group of wholesalers, broadcasters, motion picture
theaters, etc., publication takes place if the purpose is "further distribution, public performance, or public
display."
Although the periods of 75 or 100 years for anonymous and pseudonymous works and works made for hire
seem to be longer than the equivalent term provided by foreign laws and the Berne Conventions, this
difference is more apparent than real. In general, the terms in these special cases approximate, on the average,
the term of the life of the author plus 50 years established for other works. The 100-year maximum term for
unpublished works, although much more limited than the perpetual term now available under common law in
the United States and under statute in some foreign countries, is sufficient to guard against unjustified
invasions of privacy and to fulfill our obligations under the Universal Copyright Convention.
Records and Presumption as to Author's Death. Subsections (d) and (e) of section 302 together furnish
an answer to the practical problems of how to discover the death dates of obscure or unknown authors.
Subsection (d) provides a procedure for recording statements that an author died, or that he was still living, on
a particular date, and also requires the Register of Copyrights to maintain obituary records on a current basis.
Under subsection (e) anyone who, after a specified period, obtains certification from the Copyright Office that
its records show nothing to indicate that the author is living or died less than 50 years before, is entitled to rely
upon a presumption that the author has been dead for more than 50 years. The period specified in subsection
(e)—75 years from publication or 100 years from creation—is purposely uniform with the special term
provided in subsection (c).

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Theoretically, at least, the legal impact of section 303 would be far reaching. Under it, every "original work
of authorship" fixed in tangible form that is in existence would be given statutory copyright protection as long
as the work is not in the public domain in this country. The vast majority of these works consist of private
material that no one is interested in protecting or infringing, but section 303 would still have practical effects
for a prodigious body of material already in existence.
Looked at another way, however, section 303 would have a genuinely restrictive effect. Its basic purpose is
to substitute statutory for common law copyright for everything now protected at common law, and to
substitute reasonable time limits for the perpetual protection now available. In general, the substituted time
limits are those applicable to works created after the effective date of the law [Jan. 1, 1978]; for example, an
unpublished work written in 1945 whose author dies in 1980 would be protected under the statute from the
effective date [Jan. 1, 1978] through 2030 (50 years after the author's death).
A special problem under this provision is what to do with works whose ordinary statutory terms will have
expired or will be nearing expiration on the effective date [Jan. 1, 1978]. The committee believes that a
provision taking away subsisting common law rights and substituting statutory rights for a reasonable period
is fully in harmony with the constitutional requirements of due process, but it is necessary to fix a "reasonable
period" for this purpose. Section 303 provides that under no circumstances would copyright protection expire
before December 31, 2002, and also attempts to encourage publication by providing 25 years more protection
(through 2027) if the work were published before the end of 2002.

extend to the preparation during such renewed and extended term of other derivative works based
upon the copyrighted work covered by such grant.
(B) If an application to register a claim to the renewed and extended term of copyright in a work is
made within 1 year before its expiration, and the claim is registered, the certificate of such
registration shall constitute prima facie evidence as to the validity of the copyright during its
[Release Point 118-106]
renewed and extended term and of the facts stated in the certificate. The evidentiary weight to be
accorded the certificates of a registration of a renewed and extended term of copyright made after the
end of that 1-year period shall be within the discretion of the court.
(b) COPYRIGHTS IN THEIR RENEWAL TERM AT THE TIME OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE
OF THE SONNY BONO COPYRIGHT TERM EXTENSION ACT.—Any copyright still in its
renewal term at the time that the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act becomes effective shall
have a copyright term of 95 years from the date copyright was originally secured.
(c) TERMINATION OF TRANSFERS AND LICENSES COVERING EXTENDED RENEWAL
TERM.—In the case of any copyright subsisting in either its first or renewal term on January 1,
1978, other than a copyright in a work made for hire, the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a
transfer or license of the renewal copyright or any right under it, executed before January 1, 1978, by
any of the persons designated by subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, otherwise than by will, is
subject to termination under the following conditions:
(1) In the case of a grant executed by a person or persons other than the author, termination of
the grant may be effected by the surviving person or persons who executed it. In the case of a
grant executed by one or more of the authors of the work, termination of the grant may be
effected, to the extent of a particular author's share in the ownership of the renewal copyright, by
the author who executed it or, if such author is dead, by the person or persons who, under clause
(2) of this subsection, own and are entitled to exercise a total of more than one-half of that author's
termination interest.
(2) Where an author is dead, his or her termination interest is owned, and may be exercised, as
follows:
(A) The widow or widower owns the author's entire termination interest unless there are any
surviving children or grandchildren of the author, in which case the widow or widower owns
one-half of the author's interest.
(B) The author's surviving children, and the surviving children of any dead child of the
author, own the author's entire termination interest unless there is a widow or widower, in which
case the ownership of one-half of the author's interest is divided among them.
(C) The rights of the author's children and grandchildren are in all cases divided among them
and exercised on a per stirpes basis according to the number of such author's children
represented; the share of the children of a dead child in a termination interest can be exercised
only by the action of a majority of them.
(D) In the event that the author's widow or widower, children, and grandchildren are not
living, the author's executor, administrator, personal representative, or trustee shall own the
author's entire termination interest.
(3) Termination of the grant may be effected at any time during a period of five years beginning
at the end of fifty-six years from the date copyright was originally secured, or beginning on
January 1, 1978, whichever is later.
(4) The termination shall be effected by serving an advance notice in writing upon the grantee
or the grantee's successor in title. In the case of a grant executed by a person or persons other than
the author, the notice shall be signed by all of those entitled to terminate the grant under clause (1)
of this subsection, or by their duly authorized agents. In the case of a grant executed by one or
more of the authors of the work, the notice as to any one author's share shall be signed by that
author or his or her duly authorized agent or, if that author is dead, by the number and proportion
of the owners of his or her termination interest required under clauses (1) and (2) of this
subsection, or by their duly authorized agents.
(A) The notice shall state the effective date of the termination, which shall fall within the
five-year period specified by clause (3) of this subsection, or, in the case of a termination under
subsection (d), within the five-year period specified by subsection (d)(2), and the notice shall be
served not less than two or more than ten years before that date. A copy of the notice shall be
recorded in the Copyright Office before the effective date of termination, as a condition to its
taking effect.
[Release Point 118-106]
(B) The notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner of service, with requirements that
the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
(5) Termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary,
including an agreement to make a will or to make any future grant.
(6) In the case of a grant executed by a person or persons other than the author, all rights under
this title that were covered by the terminated grant revert, upon the effective date of termination, to
all of those entitled to terminate the grant under clause (1) of this subsection. In the case of a grant
executed by one or more of the authors of the work, all of a particular author's rights under this
title that were covered by the terminated grant revert, upon the effective date of termination, to
that author or, if that author is dead, to the persons owning his or her termination interest under
clause (2) of this subsection, including those owners who did not join in signing the notice of
termination under clause (4) of this subsection. In all cases the reversion of rights is subject to the
following limitations:
(A) A derivative work prepared under authority of the grant before its termination may
continue to be utilized under the terms of the grant after its termination, but this privilege does
not extend to the preparation after the termination of other derivative works based upon the
copyrighted work covered by the terminated grant.
(B) The future rights that will revert upon termination of the grant become vested on the date
the notice of termination has been served as provided by clause (4) of this subsection.
(C) Where the author's rights revert to two or more persons under clause (2) of this
subsection, they shall vest in those persons in the proportionate shares provided by that clause.
In such a case, and subject to the provisions of subclause (D) of this clause, a further grant, or
agreement to make a further grant, of a particular author's share with respect to any right
covered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is signed by the same number and proportion of
the owners, in whom the right has vested under this clause, as are required to terminate the grant
under clause (2) of this subsection. Such further grant or agreement is effective with respect to
all of the persons in whom the right it covers has vested under this subclause, including those
who did not join in signing it. If any person dies after rights under a terminated grant have
vested in him or her, that person's legal representatives, legatees, or heirs at law represent him
or her for purposes of this subclause.
(D) A further grant, or agreement to make a further grant, of any right covered by a
terminated grant is valid only if it is made after the effective date of the termination. As an
exception, however, an agreement for such a further grant may be made between the author or
any of the persons provided by the first sentence of clause (6) of this subsection, or between the
persons provided by subclause (C) of this clause, and the original grantee or such grantee's
successor in title, after the notice of termination has been served as provided by clause (4) of
this subsection.
(E) Termination of a grant under this subsection affects only those rights covered by the grant
that arise under this title, and in no way affects rights arising under any other Federal, State, or
foreign laws.
(F) Unless and until termination is effected under this subsection, the grant, if it does not
provide otherwise, continues in effect for the remainder of the extended renewal term.
(d) TERMINATION RIGHTS PROVIDED IN SUBSECTION (c) WHICH HAVE EXPIRED ON
OR BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE SONNY BONO COPYRIGHT TERM
EXTENSION ACT.—In the case of any copyright other than a work made for hire, subsisting in its
renewal term on the effective date of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act for which the
termination right provided in subsection (c) has expired by such date, where the author or owner of
the termination right has not previously exercised such termination right, the exclusive or
nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of the renewal copyright or any right under it, executed
before January 1, 1978, by any of the persons designated in subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, other
than by will, is subject to termination under the following conditions:
[Release Point 118-106]
(1) The conditions specified in subsections (c)(1), (2), (4), (5), and (6) of this section apply to
terminations of the last 20 years of copyright term as provided by the amendments made by the
Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act.
(2) Termination of the grant may be effected at any time during a period of 5 years beginning at
the end of 75 years from the date copyright was originally secured.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
The arguments in favor of lengthening the duration of copyright apply to subsisting as well as future
copyrights. The bill's basic approach is to increase the present 56-year term to 75 years in the case of
copyrights subsisting in both their first and their renewal terms.
Copyrights in Their First Term. Subsection (a) of section 304 reenacts and preserves the renewal
provision, now in Section 24 of the statute [section 24 of former title 17], for all of the works presently in their
first 28-year term. A great many of the present expectancies in these cases are the subject of existing contracts,
and it would be unfair and immensely confusing to cut off or alter these interests. Renewal registration will be
required during the 28th year of the copyright but the length of the renewal term will be increased from 28 to
47 years.
Although the bill preserves the language of the present renewal provision without any change in substance,
the Committee intends that the reference to a "posthumous work" in this section has the meaning given to it in
Bartok v. Boosey & Hawkes, Inc., 523 F.2d 941 (2d Cir. 1975)—one as to which no copyright assignment or
other contract for exploitation of the work has occurred during an author's lifetime, rather than one which is
simply first published after the author's death.
Copyrights in Their Renewal Term. Renewed copyrights that are subsisting in their second term at any
time during the period between December 31, 1976, and December 31, 1977, inclusive, would be extended
under section 304(b) to run for a total of 75 years. This provision would add another 19 years to the duration
of any renewed copyright whose second term started during the 28 years immediately preceding the effective
date of the act (January 1, 1978). In addition, it would extend by varying lesser amounts the duration of
renewal copyrights already extended under Public Laws 87–668, 89–142, 90–141, 90–416, 91–147, 91–555,
92–170, 92–566, and 93–573, all of which would otherwise expire on December 31, 1976. The subsection
would also extend the duration of renewal copyrights whose second 28-year term is scheduled to expire during
1977. In none of these cases, however, would the total terms of copyright for the work be longer than 75
years.
Subsection (b) also covers the special situation of a subsisting first-term copyright that becomes eligible for
renewal registration during the year before the act comes into effect. If a renewal registration is not made
before the effective date [Jan. 1, 1978], the case is governed by the provisions of section 304(a) [subsec. (a) of
this section]. If a renewal registration is made during the year before the new law takes effect, however, the
copyright would be treated as if it were already subsisting in its second term and would be extended to the full
period of 75 years without the need for further renewal.
Termination of Grants Covering Extended Term. An issue underlying the 19-year extension of renewal
terms under both subsections (a) and (b) of section 304 [subsecs. (a) and (b) of this section] is whether, in a
case where their rights have already been transferred, the author or the dependents of the author should be
given a chance to benefit from the extended term. The arguments for granting rights of termination are even
more persuasive under section 304 than they are under section 203; the extended term represents a completely
new property right, and there are strong reasons for giving the author, who is the fundamental beneficiary of
copyright under the Constitution, an opportunity to share in it.
Subsection (c) of section 304 is a close but not exact counterpart of section 203. In the case of either a
first-term or renewal copyright already subsisting when the new statute becomes effective [Jan. 1, 1978], any
grant of rights covering the renewal copyright in the work, executed before the effective date [Jan. 1, 1978],
may be terminated under conditions and limitations similar to those provided in section 203. Except for
transfers and licenses covering renewal copyrights already extended under Public Laws 87–668, 89–142,
90–141, 90–416, 91–147, 91–555, 92–170, 92–566, and 93–573, which would become subject to termination
immediately upon the coming into effect of the revised law, the 5-year period during which termination could
be made effective would start 56 years after copyright was originally secured.
[Release Point 118-106]
The bill distinguishes between the persons who can terminate a grant under section 203 and those entitled to
terminate a grant covering an extended term under section 304. Instead of being limited to transfers and
licenses executed by the author, the right of termination under section 304(c) also extends to grants executed
by those beneficiaries of the author who can claim renewal under the present law: his or her widow or
widower, children, executors, or next of kin.
There is good reason for this difference. Under section 203, an author's widow or widower and children are
given rights of termination if the author is dead, but these rights apply only to grants by the author, and any
effort by a widow, widower, or child to transfer contingent future interests under a termination would be
ineffective. In contrast, under the present renewal provisions, any statutory beneficiary of the author can make
a valid transfer or license of future renewal rights, which is completely binding if the author is dead and the
person who executed the grant turns out to be the proper renewal claimant. Because of this, a great many
contingent transfers of future renewal rights have been obtained from widows, widowers, children, and next of
kin, and a substantial number of these will be binding. After the present 28-year renewal period has ended, a
statutory beneficiary who has signed a disadvantageous grant of this sort should have the opportunity to
reclaim the extended term.
As explained above in connection with section 203, the bill adopts the principle that, where a transfer or
license by the author is involved, termination may be effected by a per stirpes majority of those entitled to
terminate, and this principle also applies to the ownership of rights under a termination and to the making of
further grants of reverted rights. In general, this principle has also been adopted with respect to the termination
of rights under an extended renewal copyright in section 304, but with several differences made necessary by
the differences between the legal status of transfers and licenses made after the effective date of the new law
[Jan. 1, 1978] (governed by section 203) and that of grants of renewal rights made earlier and governed by
section 304(c). The following are the most important distinctions between the termination rights under the two
sections:
1. Joint Authorship.—Under section 304, a grant of renewal rights executed by joint authors during the
first term of copyright would be effective only as to those who were living at the time of renewal; where
any of them are dead, their statutory beneficiaries are entitled to claim the renewal independently as a new
estate. It would therefore be inappropriate to impose a requirement of majority action with respect to
transfers executed by two or more joint authors.
2. Grants Not Executed by Author.—Section 304(c) adopts the majority principle underlying the
amendments of section 203 [section 203 of this title] with respect to the termination rights of a dead
author's widow or widower and children. There is much less reason, as a matter of policy, to apply this
principle in the case of transfers and licenses of renewal rights executed under the present law by the
author's widow, widower, children, executors, or next of kin, and the practical arguments against doing so
are conclusive. It is not clear how the shares of a class of renewal beneficiaries are to be divided under the
existing law, and greater difficulties would be presented if any attempt were made to apply the majority
principle to further beneficiaries in cases where one or more of the renewal beneficiaries are dead.
Therefore, where the grant was executed by a person or persons other than the author, termination can be
effected only by the unanimous action of the survivors of those who executed it.
3. Further Grants.—The reason against adopting a principle of majority action with respect to the right
to terminate grants by joint authors and grants not executed by the author apply equally with respect to the
right to make further grants under section 304(c). The requirement for majority action in clause (6)(C) is
therefore confined to cases where the rights under a grant by the author have reverted to his or her widow or
widower, or children, or both. Where the extended term reverts to joint authors or to a class of renewal
beneficiaries who have joined in executing a grant, their rights would be governed by the general rules of
tenancy in common; each coowner would have an independent right to sell his share, or to use or license the
work subject to an accounting.
Nothing contained in this section or elsewhere in this legislation is intended to extend the duration of any
license, transfer, or assignment made for a period of less than fifty-six years. If, for example, an agreement
provides an earlier termination date or lesser duration, or if it allows the author the right of cancelling or
terminating the agreement under certain circumstances, the duration is governed by the agreement. Likewise,
nothing in this section or legislation is intended to change the existing state of the law of contracts concerning
the circumstances in which an author may terminate a license, transfer or assignment.
Section 304(c)(6)(E) provides that, unless and until termination is effected under this section, the grant, "if
it does not provide otherwise," continues for the term of copyright. This section means that, if the agreement
does not contain provisions specifying its term or duration, and the author has not terminated the agreement
under this section, the agreement continues for the term of the copyright, subject to any right of termination
under circumstances which may be specified therein. If, however, an agreement does contain provisions
[Release Point 118-106]
governing its duration—for example, a term of sixty years—and the author has not exercised his or her right
of termination under the statute, the agreement will continue according to its terms—in this example, for only
sixty years. The quoted language is not to be construed as requiring agreements to reserve the right of
termination.

§305. Duration of copyright: Terminal date

which they would otherwise expire.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Under section 305, which has its counterpart in the laws of most foreign countries, the term of copyright
protection for a work extends through December 31 of the year in which the term would otherwise have
expired. This will make the duration of copyright much easier to compute, since it will be enough to determine
the year, rather than the exact date, of the event from which the term is based.
Section 305 applies only to "terms of copyright provided by sections 302 through 304," which are the
sections dealing with duration of copyright. It therefore has no effect on the other time periods specified in the
bill; and, since they do not involve "terms of copyright," the periods provided in section 304(c) with respect to
termination of grants are not affected by section 305.
The terminal date section would change the duration of subsisting copyrights under section 304 by
extending the total terms of protection under subsections (a) and (b) to the end of the 75th year from the date
copyright was secured. A copyright subsisting in its first term on the effective date of the act [Jan. 1, 1978]
would run through December 31 of the 28th year and would then expire unless renewed. Since all copyright
terms under the bill expire on December 31, and since section 304(a) requires that renewal be made "within
one year prior to the expiration of the original term of copyright," the period for renewal registration in all
cases will run from December 31 through December 31.
A special situation arises with respect to subsisting copyrights whose first 28-year term expires during the
first year after the act comes into effect. As already explained in connection with section 304(b), if a renewal
registration for a copyright of this sort is made before the effective date [Jan. 1, 1978], the total term is
extended to 75 years without the need for a further renewal registration. But, if renewal has not yet been made
when the act becomes effective [Jan. 1, 1978], the period for renewal registration may in some cases be
extended. If, as the bill provides, the act becomes effective on January 1, 1978, a copyright that was originally
[Release Point 118-106]
secured on September 1, 1950, could have been renewed by virtue of the present statute between September 1,
1977, and December 31, 1977; if not, it can still be renewed under section 304(a) of the new act between
January 1, 1978, and December 31, 1978.

§401. Notice of copyright: Visually perceptible copies
(a) GENERAL PROVISIONS.—Whenever a work protected under this title is published in the
United States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright owner, a notice of copyright as provided by
this section may be placed on publicly distributed copies from which the work can be visually
perceived, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.
(b) FORM OF NOTICE.—If a notice appears on the copies, it shall consist of the following three
elements:
(1) the symbol © (the letter C in a circle), or the word "Copyright", or the abbreviation "Copr.";
and
(2) the year of first publication of the work; in the case of compilations, or derivative works
incorporating previously published material, the year date of first publication of the compilation or
derivative work is sufficient. The year date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or
sculptural work, with accompanying text matter, if any, is reproduced in or on greeting cards,
postcards, stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful articles; and
(3) the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation by which the name can
be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the owner.
(c) POSITION OF NOTICE.—The notice shall be affixed to the copies in such manner and
location as to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright. The Register of Copyrights shall
prescribe by regulation, as examples, specific methods of affixation and positions of the notice on
various types of works that will satisfy this requirement, but these specifications shall not be
considered exhaustive.
(d) EVIDENTIARY WEIGHT OF NOTICE.—If a notice of copyright in the form and position
specified by this section appears on the published copy or copies to which a defendant in a copyright
[Release Point 118-106]
infringement suit had access, then no weight shall be given to such a defendant's interposition of a
defense based on innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except as
provided in the last sentence of section 504(c)(2).
(Pub. L. 94–553, title I, §101, Oct. 19, 1976, 90 Stat. 2576; Pub. L. 100–568, §7(a), Oct. 31, 1988,
102 Stat. 2857.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
A requirement that the public be given formal notice of every work in which copyright is claimed was a
part of the first U.S. copyright statute enacted in 1790, and since 1802 our copyright laws have always
provided that the published copies of copyrighted works must bear a specified notice as a condition of
protection. Under the present law the copyright notice serves four principal functions:
(1) It has the effect of placing in the public domain a substantial body of published material that no one
is interested in copyrighting;
(2) It informs the public as to whether a particular work is copyrighted;
(3) It identifies the copyright owner; and
(4) It shows the date of publication.
Ranged against these values of a notice requirement are its burdens and unfairness to copyright owners.
One of the strongest arguments for revision of the present statute has been the need to avoid the arbitrary and
unjust forfeitures now resulting from unintentional or relatively unimportant omissions or errors in the
copyright notice. It has been contended that the disadvantages of the notice requirement outweigh its values
and that it should therefore be eliminated or substantially liberalized.
The fundamental principle underlying the notice provisions of the bill is that the copyright notice has real
values which should be preserved, and that this should be done by inducing use of notice without causing
outright forfeiture for errors or omissions. Subject to certain safeguards for innocent infringers, protection
would not be lost by the complete omission of copyright notice from large numbers of copies or from a whole
edition, if registration for the work is made before or within 5 years after publication. Errors in the name or
date in the notice could be corrected without forfeiture of copyright.
Sections 401 and 402 set out the basic notice requirements of the bill, the former dealing with "copies from
which the work can be visually perceived," and the latter covering "phonorecords" of a "sound recording."
The notice requirements established by these parallel provisions apply only when copies or phonorecords of
the work are "publicly distributed." No copyright notice would be required in connection with the public
display of a copy by any means, including projectors, television, or cathode ray tubes connected with
information storage and retrieval systems, or in connection with the public performance of a work by means of
copies or phonorecords, whether in the presence of an audience or through television, radio, computer
transmission, or any other process.
It should be noted that, under the definition of "publication" in section 101, there would no longer be any
basis for holding, as a few court decisions have done in the past, that the public display of a work of art under
some conditions (e.g., without restriction against its reproduction) would constitute publication of the work.
And, as indicated above, the public display of a work of art would not require that a copyright notice be placed
on the copy displayed.
Subsections (a) of both section 401 and section 402 require that a notice be used whenever the work "is
published in the United States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright owner." The phrase "or elsewhere,"
which does not appear in the present law, makes the notice requirements applicable to copies or phonorecords
distributed to the public anywhere in the world, regardless of where and when the work was first published.
The values of notice are fully applicable to foreign editions of works copyrighted in the United States,
especially with the increased flow of intellectual materials across national boundaries, and the gains in the use
of notice on editions published abroad under the Universal Copyright Convention should not be wiped out.
The consequences of omissions or mistakes with respect to the notice are far less serious under the bill than
under the present law, and section 405(a) makes doubly clear that a copyright owner may guard himself
against errors or omissions by others if he makes use of the prescribed notice an express condition of his
publishing licenses.
Subsection (b) of section 401, which sets out the form of notice to appear on visually-perceptible copies,
retains the basic elements of the notice under the present law: the word "Copyright", the abbreviation "Copr.",
or the symbol "©"; the year of first publication; and the name of the copyright owner. The year of publication,
which is still significant in computing the term and determining the status of a work, is required for all
categories of copyrightable works. Clause (2) of subsection (b) makes clear that, in the case of a derivative
[Release Point 118-106]
work or compilation, it is not necessary to list the dates of publication of all preexisting material incorporated
in the work; however, as noted below in connection with section 409, the application for registration covering
a compilation or derivative work must identify "any preexisting work or works that it is based on or
incorporates." Clause (3) establishes that a recognizable abbreviation or a generally known alternative
designation may be used instead of the full name of the copyright owner.
By providing simply that the notice "shall be affixed to the copies in such manner and location as to give
reasonable notice of the claim of copyright," subsection (c) follows the flexible approach of the Universal
Copyright Convention. The further provision empowering the Register of Copyrights to set forth in
regulations a list of examples of "specific methods of affixation and positions of the notice on various types of
works that will satisfy this requirement" will offer substantial guidance and avoid a good deal of uncertainty.
A notice placed or affixed in accordance with the regulations would clearly meet the requirements but, since
the Register's specifications are not to "be considered exhaustive," a notice placed or affixed in some other
way might also comply with the law if it were found to "give reasonable notice" of the copyright claim.

(3) the name of the owner of copyright in the sound recording, or an abbreviation by which the
name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the owner; if the
producer of the sound recording is named on the phonorecord labels or containers, and if no other
name appears in conjunction with the notice, the producer's name shall be considered a part of the
notice.
[Release Point 118-106]
(c) POSITION OF NOTICE.—The notice shall be placed on the surface of the phonorecord, or on
the phonorecord label or container, in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the
claim of copyright.
(d) EVIDENTIARY WEIGHT OF NOTICE.—If a notice of copyright in the form and position
specified by this section appears on the published phonorecord or phonorecords to which a defendant
in a copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight shall be given to such a defendant's
interposition of a defense based on innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory
damages, except as provided in the last sentence of section 504(c)(2).

102 Stat. 2857.)
HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
A special notice requirement, applicable only to the subject matter of sound recordings, is established by
section 402. Since the bill protects sound recordings as separate works, independent of protection for any
literary or musical works embodied in them, there would be a likelihood of confusion if the same notice
requirements applied to sound recordings and to the works they incorporate. Like the present law, therefore,
section 402 thus sets forth requirements for a notice to appear on the "phonorecords" of "sound recordings"
that are different from the notice requirements established by section 401 for the "copies" of all other types of
copyrightable works. Since "phonorecords" are not "copies," there is no need to place a section 401 notice on
"phonorecords" to protect the literary or musical works embodied in the records.
In general, the form of the notice specified by section 402(b) consists of the symbol "(P)"; the year of first
publication of the sound recording; and the name of the copyright owner or an admissible variant. Where the
record producer's name appears on the record label, album, sleeve, jacket, or other container, it will be
considered a part of the notice if no other name appears in conjunction with it. Under subsection (c), the notice
for a copyrighted sound recording may be affixed to the surface, label, or container of the phonorecord "in
such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright."
There are at least three reasons for prescribing use of the symbol "(P)" rather than "©" in the notice to
appear on phonorecords of sound recordings. Aside from the need to avoid confusion between claims to
copyright in the sound recording and in the musical or literary work embodied in it, there is also a necessity
for distinguishing between copyright claims in the sound recording and in the printed text or art work
appearing on the record label, album cover, liner notes, et cetera. The symbol "©" has also been adopted as the
international symbol for the protection of sound recordings by the "Phonograms Convention" (the Convention
for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms, done
at Geneva October 29, 1971), to which the United States is a party.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Section 403 is aimed at a publishing practice that, while technically justified under the present law, has
been the object of considerable criticism. In cases where a Government work is published or republished
commercially, it has frequently been the practice to add some "new matter" in the form of an introduction,
editing, illustrations, etc., and to include a general copyright notice in the name of the commercial publisher.
This in no way suggests to the public that the bulk of the work is uncopyrightable and therefore free for use.
To make the notice meaningful rather than misleading, section 403 requires that, when the copies or
phonorecords consist "preponderantly of one or more works of the United States Government," the copyright
notice (if any) identify those parts of the work in which copyright is claimed. A failure to meet this
requirement would be treated as an omission of the notice, subject to the provisions of section 405.

(a) A separate contribution to a collective work may bear its own notice of copyright, as provided

sufficient to invoke the provisions of section 401(d) or 402(d), as applicable with respect to the
separate contributions it contains (not including advertisements inserted on behalf of persons other
than the owner of copyright in the collective work), regardless of the ownership of copyright in the
contributions and whether or not they have been previously published.
(b) With respect to copies and phonorecords publicly distributed by authority of the copyright
owner before the effective date of the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, where the
person named in a single notice applicable to a collective work as a whole is not the owner of
copyright in a separate contribution that does not bear its own notice, the case is governed by the
provisions of section 406(a).

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
In conjunction with the provisions of section 201(c), section 404 deals with a troublesome problem under
the present law: the notice requirements applicable to contributions published in periodicals and other
collective works. The basic approach of the section is threefold:
(1) To permit but not require a separate contribution to bear its own notice;
(2) To make a single notice, covering the collective work as a whole, sufficient to satisfy the notice
requirement for the separate contributions it contains, even if they have been previously published or their
ownership is different; and
(3) To protect the interests of an innocent infringer of copyright in a contribution that does not bear its
own notice, who has dealt in good faith with the person named in the notice covering the collective work as
a whole.
As a general rule, under this section, the rights in an individual contribution to a collective work would not
be affected by the lack of a separate copyright notice, as long as the collective work as a whole bears a notice.
One exception to this rule would apply to "advertisements inserted on behalf of persons other than the owner
of copyright in the collective work." Collective works, notably newspapers and magazines, are major
advertising media, and it is common for the same advertisement to be published in a number of different
periodicals. The general copyright notice in a particular issue would not ordinarily protect the advertisements
inserted in it, and relatively little advertising matter today is published with a separate copyright notice. The
exception in section 404(a), under which separate notices would be required for most advertisements
published in collective works, would impose no undue burdens on copyright owners and is justified by the
special circumstances.
Under section 404(b) a separate contribution that does not bear its own notice, and that is published in a
collective work with a general notice containing the name of someone other than the copyright owner of the
contribution, is treated as if it has been published with the wrong name in the notice. The case is governed by
section 406(a), which means that an innocent infringer who in good faith took a license from the person
named in the general notice would be shielded from liability to some extent.

100–568, set out as a note under section 101 of this title.
§405. Notice of copyright: Omission of notice on certain copies and phonorecords
(a) EFFECT OF OMISSION ON COPYRIGHT.—With respect to copies and phonorecords
publicly distributed by authority of the copyright owner before the effective date of the Berne
[Release Point 118-106]
Convention Implementation Act of 1988, the omission of the copyright notice described in sections
401 through 403 from copies or phonorecords publicly distributed by authority of the copyright
owner does not invalidate the copyright in a work if—
(1) the notice has been omitted from no more than a relatively small number of copies or
phonorecords distributed to the public; or
(2) registration for the work has been made before or is made within five years after the
publication without notice, and a reasonable effort is made to add notice to all copies or
phonorecords that are distributed to the public in the United States after the omission has been
discovered; or
(3) the notice has been omitted in violation of an express requirement in writing that, as a
condition of the copyright owner's authorization of the public distribution of copies or
phonorecords, they bear the prescribed notice.
(b) EFFECT OF OMISSION ON INNOCENT INFRINGERS.—Any person who innocently
infringes a copyright, in reliance upon an authorized copy or phonorecord from which the copyright
notice has been omitted and which was publicly distributed by authority of the copyright owner
before the effective date of the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, incurs no liability for
actual or statutory damages under section 504 for any infringing acts committed before receiving
actual notice that registration for the work has been made under section 408, if such person proves
that he or she was misled by the omission of notice. In a suit for infringement in such a case the court
may allow or disallow recovery of any of the infringer's profits attributable to the infringement, and
may enjoin the continuation of the infringing undertaking or may require, as a condition for
permitting the continuation of the infringing undertaking, that the infringer pay the copyright owner
a reasonable license fee in an amount and on terms fixed by the court.
(c) REMOVAL OF NOTICE.—Protection under this title is not affected by the removal,
destruction, or obliteration of the notice, without the authorization of the copyright owner, from any
publicly distributed copies or phonorecords.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Effect of Omission on Copyright Protection. The provisions of section 405(a) make clear that the notice
requirements of sections 401, 402, and 403 are not absolute and that, unlike the law now in effect, the outright
omission of a copyright notice does not automatically forfeit protection and throw the work into the public
domain. This not only represents a major change in the theoretical framework of American copyright law, but
it also seems certain to have immediate practical consequences in a great many individual cases. Under the
proposed law a work published without any copyright notice will still be subject to statutory protection for at
least 5 years, whether the omission was partial or total, unintentional or deliberate.
Under the general scheme of the bill, statutory copyright protection is secured automatically when a work is
created, and is not lost when the work is published, even if the copyright notice is omitted entirely. Subsection
(a) of section 405 provides that omission of notice, whether intentional or unintentional, does not invalidate
the copyright if either of two conditions is met:
(1) if "no more than a relatively small number" of copies or phonorecords have been publicly
distributed without notice; or
(2) if registration for the work has already been made, or is made within 5 years after the publication
without notice, and a reasonable effort is made to add notice to copies or phonorecords publicly distributed
in the United States after the omission is discovered.
Thus, if notice is omitted from more than a "relatively small number" of copies or phonorecords, copyright
is not lost immediately, but the work will go into the public domain if no effort is made to correct the error or
if the work is not registered within 5 years.
Section 405(a) takes a middle-ground approach in an effort to encourage use of a copyright notice without
causing unfair and unjustifiable forfeitures on technical grounds. Clause (1) provides that, as long as the
omission is from "no more than a relatively small number of copies or phonorecords," there is no effect upon
the copyright owner's rights except in the case of an innocent infringement covered by section 405(b); there is
[Release Point 118-106]
no need for registration or for efforts to correct the error if this clause is applicable. The phrase "relatively
small number" is intended to be less restrictive than the phrase "a particular copy or copies" now in section 21
of the present law [section 21 of former title 21].
Under clause (2) of subsection (a), the first condition for curing an omission from a larger number of copies
is that registration be made before the end of 5 years from the defective publication. This registration may
have been made before the omission took place or before the work had been published in any form and, since
the reasons for the omission have no bearing on the validity of copyright, there would be no need for the
application to refer to them. Some time limit for registration is essential and the 5-year period is reasonable
and consistent with the period provided in section 410(c).
The second condition established by clause (2) is that the copyright owner make a "reasonable effort," after
discovering his error, to add the notice to copies or phonorecords distributed thereafter. This condition is
specifically limited to copies or phonorecords publicly distributed in the United States, since it would be
burdensome and impractical to require an American copyright owner to police the activities of foreign
licensees in this situation.
The basic notice requirements set forth in sections 401(a) and 402(a) are limited to cases where a work is
published "by authority of the copyright owner" and, in prescribing the effect of omission of notice, section
405(a) refers only to omission "from copies or phonorecords publicly distributed by authority of the copyright
owner." The intention behind this language is that, where the copyright owner authorized publication of the
work, the notice requirements would not be met if copies or phonorecords are publicly distributed without a
notice, even if he expected a notice to be used. However, if the copyright owner authorized publication only
on the express condition that all copies or phonorecords bear a prescribed notice, the provisions of section 401
or 402 and of section 405 would not apply since the publication itself would not be authorized. This principle
is stated directly in section 405(a)(3).
Effect of Omission on Innocent Infringers. In addition to the possibility that copyright protection will be
forfeited under section 405(a)(2) if the notice is omitted, a second major inducement to use of the notice is
found in subsection (b) of section 405. That provision, which limits the rights of a copyright owner against
innocent infringers under certain circumstances, would be applicable whether the notice has been omitted
from a large number or from a "relatively small number" of copies. The general postulates underlying the
provision are that a person acting in good faith and with no reason to think otherwise should ordinarily be able
to assume that a work is in the public domain if there is no notice on an authorized copy or phonorecord and
that, if he relies on this assumption, he should be shielded from unreasonable liability.
Under section 405(b) an innocent infringer who acts "in reliance upon an authorized copy or phonorecord
from which the copyright notice has been omitted", and who proves that he was misled by the omission, is
shielded from liability for actual or statutory damages with respect to "any infringing acts committed before
receiving actual notice" of registration. Thus, where the infringement is completed before actual notice has
been served—as would be the usual case with respect to relatively minor infringements by teachers, librarians,
journalists, and the like—liability, if any, would be limited to the profits the infringer realized from the act of
infringement. On the other hand, where the infringing enterprise is one running over a period of time, the
copyright owner would be able to seek an injunction against continuation of the infringement, and to obtain
full monetary recovery for all infringing acts committed after he had served notice of registration. Persons
who undertake major enterprises of this sort should check the Copyright Office registration records before
starting, even where copies have been published without notice.
The purpose of the second sentence of subsection (b) is to give the courts broad discretion to balance the
equities within the framework of section 405 [this section]. Where an infringer made profits from infringing
acts committed innocently before receiving notice from the copyright owner, the court may allow or withhold
their recovery in light of the circumstances. The court may enjoin an infringement or may permit its
continuation on condition that the copyright owner be paid a reasonable license fee.
Removal of Notice by Others. Subsection (c) of section 405 involves the situation arising when, following
an authorized publication with notice, someone further down the chain of commerce removes, destroys, or
obliterates the notice. The courts dealing with this problem under the present law, especially in connection
with copyright notices on the selvage of textile fabrics, have generally upheld the validity of a notice that was
securely attached to the copies when they left the control of the copyright owner, even though removal of the
notice at some later stage was likely. This conclusion is incorporated in subsection (c).

§406. Notice of copyright: Error in name or date on certain copies and
phonorecords
(a) ERROR IN NAME.—With respect to copies and phonorecords publicly distributed by
authority of the copyright owner before the effective date of the Berne Convention Implementation
Act of 1988, where the person named in the copyright notice on copies or phonorecords publicly
distributed by authority of the copyright owner is not the owner of copyright, the validity and
ownership of the copyright are not affected. In such a case, however, any person who innocently
begins an undertaking that infringes the copyright has a complete defense to any action for such
infringement if such person proves that he or she was misled by the notice and began the undertaking
in good faith under a purported transfer or license from the person named therein, unless before the
undertaking was begun—
(1) registration for the work had been made in the name of the owner of copyright; or
(2) a document executed by the person named in the notice and showing the ownership of the
copyright had been recorded.
The person named in the notice is liable to account to the copyright owner for all receipts from
transfers or licenses purportedly made under the copyright by the person named in the notice.
(b) ERROR IN DATE.—When the year date in the notice on copies or phonorecords distributed
before the effective date of the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 by authority of the
copyright owner is earlier than the year in which publication first occurred, any period computed
from the year of first publication under section 302 is to be computed from the year in the notice.
Where the year date is more than one year later than the year in which publication first occurred, the
work is considered to have been published without any notice and is governed by the provisions of
section 405.
(c) OMISSION OF NAME OR DATE.—Where copies or phonorecords publicly distributed
before the effective date of the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 by authority of the
copyright owner contain no name or no date that could reasonably be considered a part of the notice,
the work is considered to have been published without any notice and is governed by the provisions
of section 405 as in effect on the day before the effective date of the Berne Convention
Implementation Act of 1988.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
In addition to cases where notice has been omitted entirely, it is common under the present law for a
copyright notice to be fatally defective because the name or date has been omitted or wrongly stated. Section
406 is intended to avoid technical forfeitures in these cases, while at the same time inducing use of the correct
name and date and protecting users who rely on erroneous information.
Error in Name. Section 406(a) begins with a statement that the use of the wrong name in the notice will
not affect the validity or ownership of the copyright, and then deals with situations where someone acting
innocently and in good faith infringes a copyright by relying on a purported transfer or license from the person
erroneously named in the notice. In such a case the innocent infringer is given a complete defense unless a
search of the Copyright Office records would have shown that the owner was someone other than the person
named in the notice. Use of the wrong name in the notice is no defense if, at the time infringement was begun,
registration had been made in the name of the true owner, or if "a document executed by the person named in
the notice and showing the ownership of the copyright had been recorded."
The situation dealt with in section 406(a) presupposes a contractual relation between the copyright owner
and the person named in the notice. The copies or phonorecords bearing the defective notice have been
"distributed by authority of the copyright owner" and, unless the publication can be considered unauthorized
because of breach of an express condition in the contract or other reasons, the owner must be presumed to
have acquiesced in the use of the wrong name. If the person named in the notice grants a license for use of the
work in good faith or under a misapprehension, that person should not be liable as a copyright infringer, but
the last sentence of section 406(a) would make the person named in the notice liable to account to the
copyright owner for "all receipts, from transfers or licenses purportedly made under the copyright" by that
person.
Error in Date. The familiar problems of antedated and postdated notices are dealt with in subsection (b) of
section 406. In the case of an antedated notice, where the year in the notice is earlier than the year of first
publication, the bill adopts the established judicial principle that any statutory term measured from the year of
publication will be computed from the year given in the notice. This provision would apply not only to the
copyright terms of anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire under section 302(c),
but also to the presumptive periods set forth in section 302(e).
As for postdated notices, subsection (b) provides that, where the year in the notice is more than one year
later than the year of first publication the case is treated as if the notice had been omitted and is governed by
section 405. Notices postdated by one year are quite common on works published near the end of a year, and it
would be unnecessarily strict to equate cases of that sort with works published without notice of any sort.
Omission of Name or Date. Section 406(c) provides that, if the copies or phonorecords "contain no name
or no date that could reasonably be considered a part of the notice," the result is the same as if the notice had
been omitted entirely, and section 405 controls. Unlike the present law, the bill contains no provision
requiring the elements of the copyright notice to "accompany" each other, and under section 406(c) a name or
date that could reasonably be read with the other elements may satisfy the requirements even if somewhat
separated from them. Direct contiguity or juxtaposition of the elements is no longer necessary; but if the
elements are too widely separated for their relation to be apparent, or if uncertainty is created by the presence
of other names or dates, the case would have to be treated as if the name or date, and hence the notice itself
had been omitted altogether.

§407. Deposit of copies or phonorecords for Library of Congress
(a) Except as provided by subsection (c), and subject to the provisions of subsection (e), the owner
of copyright or of the exclusive right of publication in a work published in the United States shall
deposit, within three months after the date of such publication—
(1) two complete copies of the best edition; or
(2) if the work is a sound recording, two complete phonorecords of the best edition, together
with any printed or other visually perceptible material published with such phonorecords.
Neither the deposit requirements of this subsection nor the acquisition provisions of subsection (e)
are conditions of copyright protection.
(b) The required copies or phonorecords shall be deposited in the Copyright Office for the use or
disposition of the Library of Congress. The Register of Copyrights shall, when requested by the
depositor and upon payment of the fee prescribed by section 708, issue a receipt for the deposit.
(c) The Register of Copyrights may by regulation exempt any categories of material from the
deposit requirements of this section, or require deposit of only one copy or phonorecord with respect
to any categories. Such regulations shall provide either for complete exemption from the deposit
requirements of this section, or for alternative forms of deposit aimed at providing a satisfactory
archival record of a work without imposing practical or financial hardships on the depositor, where
the individual author is the owner of copyright in a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work and (i) less
than five copies of the work have been published, or (ii) the work has been published in a limited
edition consisting of numbered copies, the monetary value of which would make the mandatory
deposit of two copies of the best edition of the work burdensome, unfair, or unreasonable.
(d) At any time after publication of a work as provided by subsection (a), the Register of
Copyrights may make written demand for the required deposit on any of the persons obligated to
make the deposit under subsection (a). Unless deposit is made within three months after the demand
is received, the person or persons on whom the demand was made are liable—
(1) to a fine of not more than $250 for each work; and
(2) to pay into a specially designated fund in the Library of Congress the total retail price of the
copies or phonorecords demanded, or, if no retail price has been fixed, the reasonable cost to the
Library of Congress of acquiring them; and
(3) to pay a fine of $2,500, in addition to any fine or liability imposed under clauses (1) and (2),
if such person willfully or repeatedly fails or refuses to comply with such a demand.
(e) With respect to transmission programs that have been fixed and transmitted to the public in the
United States but have not been published, the Register of Copyrights shall, after consulting with the
[Release Point 118-106]
Librarian of Congress and other interested organizations and officials, establish regulations
governing the acquisition, through deposit or otherwise, of copies or phonorecords of such programs
for the collections of the Library of Congress.
(1) The Librarian of Congress shall be permitted, under the standards and conditions set forth in
such regulations, to make a fixation of a transmission program directly from a transmission to the
public, and to reproduce one copy or phonorecord from such fixation for archival purposes.
(2) Such regulations shall also provide standards and procedures by which the Register of
Copyrights may make written demand, upon the owner of the right of transmission in the United
States, for the deposit of a copy or phonorecord of a specific transmission program. Such deposit
may, at the option of the owner of the right of transmission in the United States, be accomplished
by gift, by loan for purposes of reproduction, or by sale at a price not to exceed the cost of
reproducing and supplying the copy or phonorecord. The regulations established under this clause
shall provide reasonable periods of not less than three months for compliance with a demand, and
shall allow for extensions of such periods and adjustments in the scope of the demand or the
methods for fulfilling it, as reasonably warranted by the circumstances. Willful failure or refusal to
comply with the conditions prescribed by such regulations shall subject the owner of the right of
transmission in the United States to liability for an amount, not to exceed the cost of reproducing
and supplying the copy or phonorecord in question, to be paid into a specially designated fund in
the Library of Congress.
(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the making or retention, for purposes
of deposit, of any copy or phonorecord of an unpublished transmission program, the transmission
of which occurs before the receipt of a specific written demand as provided by clause (2).
(4) No activity undertaken in compliance with regulations prescribed under clauses (1) or (2) of
this subsection shall result in liability if intended solely to assist in the acquisition of copies or
phonorecords under this subsection.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
The provisions of sections 407 through 411 of the bill mark another departure from the present law. Under
the 1909 statute, deposit of copies for the collections of the Library of Congress and deposit of copies for
purposes of copyright registration have been treated as the same thing. The bill's basic approach is to regard
deposit and registration as separate though closely related: deposit of copies or phonorecords for the Library
of Congress is mandatory, but exceptions can be made for material the Library neither needs nor wants;
copyright registration is not generally mandatory, but is a condition of certain remedies for copyright
infringement. Deposit for the Library of Congress can be, and in the bulk of cases undoubtedly will be,
combined with copyright registration.
The basic requirement of the deposit provision, section 407, is that within 3 months after a work has been
published with notice of copyright in the United States, the "owner of copyright or of the exclusive right of
publication" must deposit two copies or phonorecords of the work in the Copyright Office. The Register of
Copyrights is authorized to exempt any category of material from the deposit requirements. Where the
category is not exempted and deposit is not made, the Register may demand it; failure to comply would be
penalized by a fine.
Under the present law deposits for the Library of Congress must be combined with copyright registration,
and failure to comply with a formal demand for deposit and registration results in complete loss of copyright.
Under section 407 of the bill, the deposit requirements can be satisfied without ever making registration, and
subsection (a) makes clear that deposit "is not a condition of copyright protection." A realistic fine, coupled
with the increased inducements for voluntary registration and deposit under other sections of the bill, seems
likely to produce a more effective deposit system than the present one. The bill's approach will also avoid the
danger that, under a divisible copyright, one copyright owner's rights could be destroyed by another owner's
failure to deposit.
Although the basic deposit requirements are limited to works "published with notice of copyright in the
United States," they would become applicable as soon as a work first published abroad is published in this
country through the distribution of copies or phonorecords that are either imported or are part of an American
[Release Point 118-106]
edition. With respect to all types or works other than sound recordings, the basic obligation is to deposit "two
complete copies of the best edition"; the term "best edition," as defined in section 101, makes clear that the
Library of Congress is entitled to receive copies of phonorecords from the edition it believes best suits its
needs regardless of the quantity or quality of other U.S. editions that may also have been published before the
time of deposit. Once the deposit requirements for a particular work have been satisfied under section 407,
however, the Library cannot claim deposit of future editions unless they represent newly copyrightable works
under section 103.
The deposit requirement for sound recordings includes "two complete phonorecords of the best edition" and
any other visually-perceptible material published with the phonorecords. The reference here is to the text or
pictorial matter appearing on record sleeves and album covers or embodied in separate leaflets or booklets
included in a sleeve, album, or other container. The required deposit in the case of a sound recording would
extend to the entire "package" and not just to the disk, tape, or other phonorecord included as part of it.
Deposits under section 407, although made in the Copyright Office, are "for the use or disposition of the
Library of Congress." Thus, the fundamental criteria governing regulations issued under section 407(c), which
allows exemptions from the deposit requirements for certain categories of works, would be the needs and
wants of the Library. The purpose of this provision is to make the deposit requirements as flexible as possible,
so that there will be no obligation to make deposits where it serves no purpose, so that only one copy or
phonorecord may be deposited where two are not needed, and so that reasonable adjustments can be made to
meet practical needs in special cases. The regulations, in establishing special categories for these purposes,
would necessarily balance the value of the copies or phonorecords to the collections of the Library of
Congress against the burdens and costs to the copyright owner of providing them.
The Committee adopted an amendment to subsection (c) of section 407, aimed at meeting the concerns
expressed by representatives of various artists' groups concerning the deposit of expensive art works and
graphics published in limited editions. Under the present law, optional deposit of photographs is permitted for
various classes of works, but not for fine prints, and this has resulted in many artists choosing to forfeit
copyright protection rather than bear the expense of depositing "two copies of the best edition." To avoid this
unfair result, the last sentence of subsection (c) would require the Register to issue regulations under which
such works would either be exempted entirely from the mandatory deposit or would be subject to an
appropriate alternative form of deposit.
If, within three months after the Register of Copyrights has made a formal demand for deposit in
accordance with section 407(d), the person on whom the demand was made has not complied, that person
becomes liable to a fine up to $250 for each work, plus the "total retail price of the copies or phonorecords
demanded." If no retail price has been fixed, clause (2) of subsection (d) establishes the additional amount as
"the reasonable cost to the Library of Congress of acquiring them." Thus, where the copies or phonorecords
are not available for sale through normal trade channels—as would be true of many motion picture films,
video tapes, and computer tapes, for example—the item of cost to be included in the fine would be equal to
the basic expense of duplicating the copies or phonorecords plus a reasonable amount representing what it
would have cost the Library to obtain them under its normal acquisitions procedures, if they had been
available.
There have been cases under the present law in which the mandatory deposit provisions have been
deliberately and repeatedly ignored, presumably on the assumption that the Library is unlikely to enforce
them. In addition to the penalties provided in the current bill, the last clause of subsection (d) would add a fine
of $2,500 for willful or repeated failure or refusal to deposit upon demand.
The Committee also amended section 407 [this section] by adding a new subsection (e), with conforming
amendments of sections 407(a) and 408(b). These amendments are intended to provide a basis for the Library
of Congress to acquire, as a part of the copyright deposit system, copies or recordings of non-syndicated radio
and television programs, without imposing any hardships on broadcasters. Under subsection (e) the Library is
authorized to tape programs off the air in all cases and may "demand" that the broadcaster supply the Library
with a copy or phonorecord of a particular program. However, this "demand" authority is extremely limited:
(1) The broadcaster is not required to retain any recording of a program after it has been transmitted unless a
demand has already been received; (2) the demand would cover only a particular program; "blanket" demands
would not be permitted; (3) the broadcaster would have the option of supplying the demand by gift, by loan
for purposes of reproduction, or by sale at cost; and (4) the penalty for willful failure or refusal to comply with
a demand is limited to the cost of reproducing and supplying the copy or phonorecord in question.

EFFECTIVE DATE OF 1988 AMENDMENT
Amendment by Pub. L. 100–568 effective Mar. 1, 1989, with any cause of action arising under this title
before such date being governed by provisions in effect when cause of action arose, see section 13 of Pub. L.
100–568, set out as a note under section 101 of this title.
DEPOSITS AND REGISTRATIONS MADE AFTER DECEMBER 31, 1977, IN RESPONSE TO
DEMAND UNDER PREDECESSOR DEMAND AND PENALTY PROVISIONS
Pub. L. 94–553, title I, §110, Oct. 19, 1976, 90 Stat. 2600, provided that: "The demand and penalty
provisions of section 14 of title 17 as it existed on December 31, 1977, apply to any work in which copyright
has been secured by publication with notice of copyright on or before that date, but any deposit and
registration made after that date in response to a demand under that section shall be made in accordance with
the provisions of title 17 as amended by the first section of this Act."
§408. Copyright registration in general
(a) REGISTRATION PERMISSIVE.—At any time during the subsistence of the first term of
copyright in any published or unpublished work in which the copyright was secured before January
1, 1978, and during the subsistence of any copyright secured on or after that date, the owner of
copyright or of any exclusive right in the work may obtain registration of the copyright claim by
delivering to the Copyright Office the deposit specified by this section, together with the application
and fee specified by sections 409 and 708. Such registration is not a condition of copyright
protection.
(b) DEPOSIT FOR COPYRIGHT REGISTRATION.—Except as provided by subsection (c), the
material deposited for registration shall include—
(1) in the case of an unpublished work, one complete copy or phonorecord;
(2) in the case of a published work, two complete copies or phonorecords of the best edition;
(3) in the case of a work first published outside the United States, one complete copy or
phonorecord as so published;
(4) in the case of a contribution to a collective work, one complete copy or phonorecord of the
best edition of the collective work.
Copies or phonorecords deposited for the Library of Congress under section 407 may be used to
satisfy the deposit provisions of this section, if they are accompanied by the prescribed application
and fee, and by any additional identifying material that the Register may, by regulation, require. The
Register shall also prescribe regulations establishing requirements under which copies or
phonorecords acquired for the Library of Congress under subsection (e) of section 407, otherwise
than by deposit, may be used to satisfy the deposit provisions of this section.
(c) ADMINISTRATIVE CLASSIFICATION AND OPTIONAL DEPOSIT.—
(1) The Register of Copyrights is authorized to specify by regulation the administrative classes
into which works are to be placed for purposes of deposit and registration, and the nature of the
copies or phonorecords to be deposited in the various classes specified. The regulations may
require or permit, for particular classes, the deposit of identifying material instead of copies or
phonorecords, the deposit of only one copy or phonorecord where two would normally be
required, or a single registration for a group of related works. This administrative classification of
works has no significance with respect to the subject matter of copyright or the exclusive rights
provided by this title.
(2) Without prejudice to the general authority provided under clause (1), the Register of
Copyrights shall establish regulations specifically permitting a single registration for a group of
[Release Point 118-106]
works by the same individual author, all first published as contributions to periodicals, including
newspapers, within a twelve-month period, on the basis of a single deposit, application, and
registration fee, under the following conditions:
(A) if the deposit consists of one copy of the entire issue of the periodical, or of the entire
section in the case of a newspaper, in which each contribution was first published; and
(B) if the application identifies each work separately, including the periodical containing it
and its date of first publication.
(3) As an alternative to separate renewal registrations under subsection (a) of section 304, a
single renewal registration may be made for a group of works by the same individual author, all
first published as contributions to periodicals, including newspapers, upon the filing of a single
application and fee, under all of the following conditions:
(A) the renewal claimant or claimants, and the basis of claim or claims under section 304(a),
is the same for each of the works; and
(B) the works were all copyrighted upon their first publication, either through separate
copyright notice and registration or by virtue of a general copyright notice in the periodical
issue as a whole; and
(C) the renewal application and fee are received not more than twenty-eight or less than
twenty-seven years after the thirty-first day of December of the calendar year in which all of the
works were first published; and
(D) the renewal application identifies each work separately, including the periodical
containing it and its date of first publication.
(d) CORRECTIONS AND AMPLIFICATIONS.—The Register may also establish, by regulation,
formal procedures for the filing of an application for supplementary registration, to correct an error
in a copyright registration or to amplify the information given in a registration. Such application
shall be accompanied by the fee provided by section 708, and shall clearly identify the registration to
be corrected or amplified. The information contained in a supplementary registration augments but
does not supersede that contained in the earlier registration.
(e) PUBLISHED EDITION OF PREVIOUSLY REGISTERED WORK.—Registration for the
first published edition of a work previously registered in unpublished form may be made even
though the work as published is substantially the same as the unpublished version.
(f) PREREGISTRATION OF WORKS BEING PREPARED FOR COMMERCIAL
DISTRIBUTION.—
(1) RULEMAKING.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this subsection,
the Register of Copyrights shall issue regulations to establish procedures for preregistration of a
work that is being prepared for commercial distribution and has not been published.
(2) CLASS OF WORKS.—The regulations established under paragraph (1) shall permit
preregistration for any work that is in a class of works that the Register determines has had a
history of infringement prior to authorized commercial distribution.
(3) APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION.—Not later than 3 months after the first publication
of a work preregistered under this subsection, the applicant shall submit to the Copyright Office—
(A) an application for registration of the work;
(B) a deposit; and
(C) the applicable fee.
(4) EFFECT OF UNTIMELY APPLICATION.—An action under this chapter for infringement
of a work preregistered under this subsection, in a case in which the infringement commenced no
later than 2 months after the first publication of the work, shall be dismissed if the items described
in paragraph (3) are not submitted to the Copyright Office in proper form within the earlier of—
(A) 3 months after the first publication of the work; or
(B) 1 month after the copyright owner has learned of the infringement.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Permissive Registration. Under section 408(a), registration of a claim to copyright in any work whether
published or unpublished, can be made voluntarily by "the owner of copyright or of any exclusive right in the
work" at any time during the copyright term. The claim may be registered in the Copyright Office by
depositing the copies, phonorecords, or other material specified by subsection (b) and (c), together with an
application and fee. Except where, under section 405(a), registration is made to preserve a copyright that
would otherwise be invalidated because of omission of the notice, registration is not a condition of copyright
protection.
Deposit for Purpose of Copyright Registration. In general, and subject to various exceptions, the material
to be deposited for copyright registration consists of one complete copy or phonorecord of an unpublished
work, and two complete copies or phonorecords of the best edition in the case of a published work. Section
408(b) provides special deposit requirements in the case of a work first published abroad ("one complete copy
or phonorecord as so published") and in the case of a contribution to a collective work ("one complete copy or
phonorecord of the best edition of the collective work"). As a general rule the deposit of more than a tear sheet
or similar fraction of a collective work is needed to identify the contribution properly and to show the form in
which it was published. Where appropriate as in the case of collective works such as multivolume
encyclopedias, multipart newspaper editions, and works that are rare or out of print, the regulations issued by
the Register under section 408(c) can be expected to make exceptions or special provisions.
With respect to works published in the United States, a single deposit could be used to satisfy the deposit
requirements of section 407 and the registration requirements of section 408, if the application and fee for
registration are submitted at the same time and are accompanied by "any additional identifying material"
required by regulations. To serve this dual purpose the deposit and registration would have to be made
simultaneously; if a deposit under section 407 had already been made, an additional deposit would be required
under section 408. In addition, since deposit for the Library of Congress and registration of a claim to
copyright serve essentially different functions, section 408(b) authorizes the Register of Copyrights to issue
regulations under which deposit of additional material, needed for identification of the work in which
copyright is claimed, could be required in certain cases.
Administrative Classification. It is important that the statutory provisions setting forth the subject matter
of copyright be kept entirely separate from any classification of copyrightable works for practical
administrative purposes. Section 408(c)(1) thus leaves it to the Register of Copyrights to specify "the
administrative classes into which works are to be placed for purposes of deposit and registration," and makes
clear that this administrative classification "has no significance with respect to the subject matter of copyright
or the exclusive rights provided by this title."
Optional Deposit. Consistent with the principle of administrative flexibility underlying all of the deposit
and registration provisions, subsection (c) of section 408 also gives the Register latitude in adjusting the type
of material deposited to the needs of the registration system. The Register is authorized to issue regulations
specifying "the nature of the copies of phonorecords to be deposited in the various classes" and, for particular
classes, to require or permit deposit of identifying material rather than copies or phonorecords, deposit of one
copy or phonorecord rather than two, or, in the case of a group of related works, a single rather than a number
of separate registrations. Under this provision the Register could, where appropriate, permit deposit of
phonorecords rather than notated copies of musical compositions, allow or require deposit of print-outs of
computer programs under certain circumstances, or permit deposit of one volume of an encyclopedia for
purposes of registration of a single contribution.
Where the copies or phonorecords are bulky, unwieldy, easily broken, or otherwise impractical to file and
retain as records identifying the work registered, the Register would be able to require or permit the substitute
deposit of material that would better serve the purpose of identification. Cases of this sort might include, for
example, billboard posters, toys and dolls, ceramics and glassware, costume jewelry, and a wide range of
three-dimensional objects embodying copyrighted material. The Register's authority would also extend to rare
or extremely valuable copies which would be burdensome or impossible to deposit. Deposit of one copy or
phonorecord rather than two would probably be justifiable in the case of most motion pictures, and in any case
where the Library of Congress has no need for the deposit and its only purpose is identification.
The provision empowering the Register to allow a number of related works to be registered together as a
group represents a needed and important liberalization of the law now in effect. At present the requirement for
[Release Point 118-106]
separate registrations where related works or parts of a work are published separately has created
administrative problems and has resulted in unnecessary burdens and expenses on authors and other copyright
owners. In a number of cases the technical necessity for separate applications and fees has caused copyright
owners to forego copyright altogether. Examples of cases where these undesirable and unnecessary results
could be avoided by allowing a single registration include the various editions or issues of a daily newspaper,
a work published in serial installments, a group of related jewelry designs, a group of photographs by one
photographer, a series of greeting cards related to each other in some way, or a group of poems by a single
author.
Single Registration. Section 408(c)(2) directs the Register of Copyrights to establish regulations permitting
under certain conditions a single registration for a group of works by the same individual author, all first
published as contributions to periodicals, including newspapers, within a twelve-month period, on the basis of
a single deposit, application, and registration fee. It is required that each of the works as first published have a
separate copyright notice, and that the name of the owner of copyright in the work, (or an abbreviation by
which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the owner) is the same in
each notice. It is further required that the deposit consist of one copy of the entire issue of the periodical, or of
the entire section in the case of a newspaper, in which each contribution is first published. Finally, the
application shall identify each work separately, including the periodical containing it and its date of first
publication.
Section 408(c)(3) provides under certain conditions an alternative to the separate renewal registrations of
subsection (a). If the specified conditions are met, a single renewal registration may be made for a group of
works by the same individual author, all first published as contributions to periodicals, including newspapers,
upon the filing of a single application and fee. It is required that the renewal claimant or claimants, and the
basis of claim or claims under section 304(a), is the same for each of the works; that the works were all
copyrighted upon their first publication, either through separate copyright notice and registration or by virtue
of a general copyright notice in the periodical issue as a whole; that the renewal application and fee are
received not more than twenty-eight or less than twenty-seven years after December 31 of the calendar year in
which all of the works were first published; and that the renewal application identifies each work separately,
including the periodical containing it and its date of first publication.
Corrections and Amplifications. Another unsatisfactory aspect of the present law is the lack of any
provision for correcting or amplifying the information given in a completed registration. Subsection (d) of
section 408 would remedy this by authorizing the Register to establish "formal procedures for the filing of an
application for supplementary registration," in order to correct an error or amplify the information in a
copyright registration. The "error" to be corrected under subsection (d) is an error by the applicant that the
Copyright Office could not have been expected to note during its examination of the claim; where the error in
a registration is the result of the Copyright Office's own mistake or oversight, the Office can make the
correction on its own initiative and without recourse to the "supplementary registration" procedure.
Under subsection (d), a supplementary registration is subject to payment of a separate fee and would be
maintained as an independent record, separate and apart from the record of the earlier registration it is
intended to supplement. However, it would be required to identify clearly "the registration to be corrected or
amplified" so that the two registrations could be tied together by appropriate means in the Copyright Office
records. The original registration would not be expunged or cancelled; as stated in the subsection: "The
information contained in a supplementary registration augments but does not supersede that contained in the
earlier registration."
Published Edition of Previously Registered Work. The present statute requires that, where a work is
registered in unpublished form, it must be registered again when it is published, whether or not the published
edition contains any new copyrightable material. Under the bill there would be no need to make a second
registration for the published edition unless it contains sufficient added material to be considered a "derivative
work" or "compilation" under section 103.
On the other hand, there will be a number of cases where the copyright owner, although not required to do
so, would like to have registration made for the published edition of the work, especially since the owner will
still be obliged to deposit copies or phonorecords of it in the Copyright Office under section 407. From the
point of view of the public there are advantages in allowing the owner to do so, since registration for the
published edition will put on record the facts about the work in the form in which it is actually distributed to
the public. Accordingly, section 408(e), which is intended to accomplish this result, makes an exception to the
general rule against allowing more than one registration for the same work.

HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
The various clauses of section 409, which specify the information to be included in an application for
copyright registration, are intended to give the Register of Copyrights authority to elicit all of the information
needed to examine the application and to make a meaningful record of registration. The list of enumerated
items was not exhaustive; under the last clause of the section the application may also include "any other
information regarded by the Register of Copyrights as bearing upon the preparation or identification of the
work or the existence, ownership, or duration of the copyright."
Among the enumerated items there are several that are not now included in the Copyright Office's
application forms, but will become significant under the life-plus-50 term and other provisions of the bill.
Clause (5), reflecting the increased importance of the interrelationship between registration of copyright
claims and recordation of transfers of ownership, requires a statement of how a claimant who is not the author
acquired ownership of the copyright. Clause (9) requires that, "in the case of a compilation or derivative work"
the application include "an identification of any preexisting work or works that it is based on or incorporates,
and a brief, general statement of the additional material covered by the copyright claim being registered." It is
intended that, under this requirement, the application covering a collection such as a song-book or hymnal
would clearly reveal any works in the collection that are in the public domain, and the copyright status of all
other previously-published compositions. This information will be readily available in the Copyright Office.
The catch-all clause at the end of the section will enable the Register to obtain more specialized
information, such as that bearing on whether the work contains material that is a "work of the United States
Government." In the case of works subject to the manufacturing requirement, the application must also
include information about the manufacture of the copies.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
The first two subsections of section 410 set forth the two basic duties of the Register of Copyrights with
respect to copyright registration: (1) to register the claim and issue a certificate if the Register determines that
"the material deposited constitutes copyrightable subject matter and that the other legal and formal
requirements of this title have been met," and (2) to refuse registration and notify the applicant if the Register
determines that "the material deposited does not constitute copyrightable subject matter or that the claim is
invalid for any other reason."
Subsection (c) deals with the probative effect of a certificate of registration issued by the Register under
subsection (a). Under its provisions, a certificate is required to be given prima facie weight in any judicial
proceedings if the registration it covers was made "before or within five years after first publication of the
work"; thereafter the court is given discretion to decide what evidentiary weight the certificate should be
accorded. This five-year period is based on a recognition that the longer the lapse of time between publication
and registration the less likely to be reliable are the facts stated in the certificate.
Under section 410(c), a certificate is to "constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and
of the facts stated in the certificate." The principle that a certificate represents prima facie evidence of
copyright validity has been established in a long line of court decisions, and it is a sound one. It is true that,
unlike a patent claim, a claim to copyright is not examined for basic validity before a certificate is issued. On
the other hand, endowing a copyright claimant who has obtained a certificate with a rebuttable presumption of
the validity of the copyright does not deprive the defendant in an infringement suit of any rights, it merely
orders the burdens of proof. The plaintiff should not ordinarily be forced in the first instance to prove all of the
multitude of facts that underline the validity of the copyright unless the defendant, by effectively challenging
them, shifts the burden of doing so to the plaintiff.
Section 410(d), which is in accord with the present practice of the Copyright Office, makes the effective
date of registration the day when an application, deposit, and fee "which are later determined by the Register
of Copyrights or by a court of competent jurisdiction to be acceptable for registration" have all been received.
Where the three necessary elements are received at different times the date of receipt of the last of them is
controlling, regardless of when the Copyright Office acts on the claim. The provision not only takes account
of the inevitable timelag between receipt of the application and other material and the issuance of the
certificate, but it also recognizes the possibility that a court might later find the Register wrong in refusing

REGISTRATION OF CLAIMS TO COPYRIGHTS AND RECORDATION OF ASSIGNMENTS OF
COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS UNDER PREDECESSOR PROVISIONS
Pub. L. 94–553, title I, §109, Oct. 19, 1976, 90 Stat. 2600, provided that: "The registration of claims to
[Release Point 118-106]
copyright for which the required deposit, application, and fee were received in the Copyright Office before
January 1, 1978, and the recordation of assignments of copyright or other instruments received in the
Copyright Office before January 1, 1978, shall be made in accordance with title 17 as it existed on December
31, 1977."
§411. Registration and civil infringement actions
(a) Except for an action brought for a violation of the rights of the author under section 106A(a),
and subject to the provisions of subsection (b),1 no civil action for infringement of the copyright in
any United States work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim
has been made in accordance with this title. In any case, however, where the deposit, application, and
fee required for registration have been delivered to the Copyright Office in proper form and
registration has been refused, the applicant is entitled to institute a civil action for infringement if
notice thereof, with a copy of the complaint, is served on the Register of Copyrights. The Register
may, at his or her option, become a party to the action with respect to the issue of registrability of the
copyright claim by entering an appearance within sixty days after such service, but the Register's
failure to become a party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine that issue.
(b)(1) A certificate of registration satisfies the requirements of this section and section 412,
regardless of whether the certificate contains any inaccurate information, unless—
(A) the inaccurate information was included on the application for copyright registration with
knowledge that it was inaccurate; and
(B) the inaccuracy of the information, if known, would have caused the Register of Copyrights
to refuse registration.
(2) In any case in which inaccurate information described under paragraph (1) is alleged, the court
shall request the Register of Copyrights to advise the court whether the inaccurate information, if
known, would have caused the Register of Copyrights to refuse registration.
(3) Nothing in this subsection shall affect any rights, obligations, or requirements of a person
related to information contained in a registration certificate, except for the institution of and remedies
in infringement actions under this section and section 412.
(c) In the case of a work consisting of sounds, images, or both, the first fixation of which is made
simultaneously with its transmission, the copyright owner may, either before or after such fixation
takes place, institute an action for infringement under section 501, fully subject to the remedies
provided by sections 502 through 505 and section 510, if, in accordance with requirements that the
Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation, the copyright owner—
(1) serves notice upon the infringer, not less than 48 hours before such fixation, identifying the
work and the specific time and source of its first transmission, and declaring an intention to secure
copyright in the work; and
(2) makes registration for the work, if required by subsection (a), within three months after its
first transmission.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
The first sentence of section 411(a) restates the present statutory requirement that registration must be made
before a suit for copyright infringement is instituted. Under the bill, as under the law now in effect, a
copyright owner who has not registered his claim can have a valid cause of action against someone who has
infringed his copyright, but he cannot enforce his rights in the courts until he has made registration.
The second and third sentences of section 411(a) would alter the present law as interpreted in Vacheron &
[Release Point 118-106]
Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc. v. Benrus Watch Co., 260 F.2d 637 (2d Cir. 1958). That case requires an
applicant, who has sought registration and has been refused, to bring an action against the Register of
Copyrights to compel the issuance of a certificate, before suit can be brought against an infringer. Under
section 411, a rejected claimant who has properly applied for registration may maintain an infringement suit if
notice of it is served on the Register of Copyrights. The Register is authorized, though not required, to enter
the suit within 60 days; the Register would be a party on the issue of registrability only, and a failure by the
Register to join the action would "not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine that issue."
Section 411(b) is intended to deal with the special situation presented by works that are being transmitted
"live" at the same time they are being fixed in tangible form for the first time. Under certain circumstances,
where the infringer has been given advance notice, an injunction could be obtained to prevent the
unauthorized use of the material included in the "live" transmission.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
The need for section 412 arises from two basic changes the bill will make in the present law.
(1) Copyright registration for published works, which is useful and important to users and the public at
large, would no longer be compulsory, and should therefore be induced in some practical way.
(2) The great body of unpublished works now protected at common law would automatically be
brought under copyright and given statutory protection. The remedies for infringement presently available
at common law should continue to apply to these works under the statute, but they should not be given
special statutory remedies unless the owner has, by registration, made a public record of his copyright
claim.
Under the general scheme of the bill, a copyright owner whose work has been infringed before registration
would be entitled to the remedies ordinarily available in infringement cases: an injunction on terms the court
considers fair, and his actual damages plus any applicable profits not used as a measure of damages. However,
section 412 would deny any award of the special or "extraordinary" remedies of statutory damages or
attorney's fees where infringement of copyright in an unpublished work began before registration or where, in
the case of a published work, infringement commenced after publication and before registration (unless
registration has been made within a grace period of three months after publication). These provisions would
be applicable to works of foreign and domestic origin alike.
In providing that statutory damages and attorney's fees are not recoverable for infringement of unpublished,
unregistered works, clause (1) of section 412 in no way narrows the remedies available under the present law.
With respect to published works, clause (2) would generally deny an award of those two special remedies
where infringement takes place before registration. As an exception, however, the clause provides a grace
period of three months after publication during which registration can be made without loss of remedies; full
remedies could be recovered for any infringement begun during the three months after publication if
registration is made before that period has ended. This exception is needed to take care of newsworthy or
suddenly popular works which may be infringed almost as soon as they are published, before the copyright
owner has had a reasonable opportunity to register his claim.

§501. Infringement of copyright
(a) Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by
sections 106 through 122 or of the author as provided in section 106A(a), or who imports copies or
phonorecords into the United States in violation of section 602, is an infringer of the copyright or
right of the author, as the case may be. For purposes of this chapter (other than section 506), any
reference to copyright shall be deemed to include the rights conferred by section 106A(a). As used in
this subsection, the term "anyone" includes any State, any instrumentality of a State, and any officer
[Release Point 118-106]
or employee of a State or instrumentality of a State acting in his or her official capacity. Any State,
and any such instrumentality, officer, or employee, shall be subject to the provisions of this title in
the same manner and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity.
(b) The legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a copyright is entitled, subject to the
requirements of section 411, to institute an action for any infringement of that particular right
committed while he or she is the owner of it. The court may require such owner to serve written
notice of the action with a copy of the complaint upon any person shown, by the records of the
Copyright Office or otherwise, to have or claim an interest in the copyright, and shall require that
such notice be served upon any person whose interest is likely to be affected by a decision in the
case. The court may require the joinder, and shall permit the intervention, of any person having or
claiming an interest in the copyright.
(c) For any secondary transmission by a cable system that embodies a performance or a display of
a work which is actionable as an act of infringement under subsection (c) of section 111, a television
broadcast station holding a copyright or other license to transmit or perform the same version of that
work shall, for purposes of subsection (b) of this section, be treated as a legal or beneficial owner if
such secondary transmission occurs within the local service area of that television station.
(d) For any secondary transmission by a cable system that is actionable as an act of infringement
pursuant to section 111(c)(3), the following shall also have standing to sue: (i) the primary
transmitter whose transmission has been altered by the cable system; and (ii) any broadcast station
within whose local service area the secondary transmission occurs.
(e) With respect to any secondary transmission that is made by a satellite carrier of a performance
or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission and is actionable as an act of infringement
under section 119(a)(3), a network station holding a copyright or other license to transmit or perform
the same version of that work shall, for purposes of subsection (b) of this section, be treated as a
legal or beneficial owner if such secondary transmission occurs within the local service area of that
station.
(f)(1) With respect to any secondary transmission that is made by a satellite carrier of a
performance or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission and is actionable as an act of
infringement under section 122, a television broadcast station holding a copyright or other license to
transmit or perform the same version of that work shall, for purposes of subsection (b) of this
section, be treated as a legal or beneficial owner if such secondary transmission occurs within the
local market of that station.
(2) A television broadcast station may file a civil action against any satellite carrier that has
refused to carry television broadcast signals, as required under section 122(a)(2), to enforce that
television broadcast station's rights under section 338(a) of the Communications Act of 1934.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
The bill, unlike the present law, contains a general statement of what constitutes infringement of copyright.
Section 501(a) identifies a copyright infringer as someone who "violates any of the exclusive rights of the
copyright owner as provided by sections 106 through 118" of the bill, or who imports copies or phonorecords
in violation of section 602. Under the latter section an unauthorized importation of copies or phonorecords
acquired abroad is an infringement of the exclusive right of distribution under certain circumstances.
The principle of the divisibility of copyright ownership, established by section 201(d), carries with it the
need in infringement actions to safeguard the rights of all copyright owners and to avoid a multiplicity of
[Release Point 118-106]
suits. Subsection (b) of section 501 enables the owner of a particular right to bring an infringement action in
that owner's name alone, while at the same time insuring to the extent possible that the other owners whose
rights may be affected are notified and given a chance to join the action.
The first sentence of subsection (b) empowers the "legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right" to bring
suit for "any infringement of that particular right committed while he or she is the owner of it." A "beneficial
owner" for this purpose would include, for example, an author who had parted with legal title to the copyright
in exchange for percentage royalties based on sales or license fees.
The second and third sentences of section 501(b), which supplement the provisions of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure [Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure], give the courts discretion to require the plaintiff
to serve notice of the plaintiff's suit on "any person shown, by the records of the Copyright Office or
otherwise, to have or claim an interest in the copyright"; where a person's interest "is likely to be affected by a
decision in the case" a court order requiring service of notice is mandatory. As under the Federal rules, the
court has discretion to require joinder of "any person having or claiming an interest in the copyright"; but, if
any such person wishes to become a party, the court must permit that person's intervention.
In addition to cases involving divisibility of ownership in the same version of a work, section 501(b) is
intended to allow a court to permit or compel joinder of the owners of rights in works upon which a derivative
work is based.
Section 501 contains two provisions conferring standing to sue under the statue upon broadcast stations in
specific situations involving secondary transmissions by cable systems. Under subsection (c), a local
television broadcaster licensed to transmit a work can sue a cable system importing the same version of the
work into the broadcaster's local service area in violation of section 111(c). Subsection (d) deals with cases
arising under section 111(c)(3), the provision dealing with substitution or alteration by a cable system of
commercials or other programming; in such cases standing to sue is also conferred on: (1) the primary
transmitter whose transmission has been altered by the cable system, and (2) any broadcast stations within
whose local service area the secondary transmission occurs. These provisions are linked to section 509, a new
provision on remedies for alteration of programming by cable systems, discussed below.
Vicarious Liability for Infringing Performances. The committee has considered and rejected an
amendment to this section intended to exempt the proprietors of an establishment, such as a ballroom or night
club, from liability for copyright infringement committed by an independent contractor, such as an orchestra
leader. A well-established principle of copyright law is that a person who violates any of the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner is an infringer, including persons who can be considered related or vicarious infringers.
To be held a related or vicarious infringer in the case of performing rights, a defendant must either actively
operate or supervise the operation of the place wherein the performances occur, or control the content of the
infringing program, and expect commercial gain from the operation and either direct or indirect benefit from
the infringing performance. The committee has decided that no justification exists for changing existing law,
and causing a significant erosion of the public performance right.

HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Section 502(a) [subsec. (a) of this section] reasserts the discretionary power of courts to grant injunctions
and restraining orders, whether "preliminary," "temporary," "interlocutory," "permanent," or "final," to
prevent or stop infringements of copyright. This power is made subject to the provisions of section 1498 of
title 28 dealing with infringement actions against the United States. The latter reference in section 502(a)
makes it clear that the bill would not permit the granting of an injunction against an infringement for which
the Federal Government is liable under section 1498.
Under subsection (b), which is the counterpart of provisions in sections 112 and 113 of the present statute
[sections 112 and 113 of former title 17], a copyright owner who has obtained an injunction in one State will
be able to enforce it against a defendant located anywhere else in the United States.

§503. Remedies for infringement: Impounding and disposition of infringing
articles
(a)(1) At any time while an action under this title is pending, the court may order the impounding,
on such terms as it may deem reasonable—
(A) of all copies or phonorecords claimed to have been made or used in violation of the
exclusive right of the copyright owner;
(B) of all plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or other articles by means of
which such copies or phonorecords may be reproduced; and
(C) of records documenting the manufacture, sale, or receipt of things involved in any such
violation, provided that any records seized under this subparagraph shall be taken into the custody
of the court.
(2) For impoundments of records ordered under paragraph (1)(C), the court shall enter an
appropriate protective order with respect to discovery and use of any records or information that has
been impounded. The protective order shall provide for appropriate procedures to ensure that
confidential, private, proprietary, or privileged information contained in such records is not
improperly disclosed or used.
(3) The relevant provisions of paragraphs (2) through (11) of section 34(d) of the Trademark Act
(15 U.S.C. 1116(d)(2) through (11)) shall extend to any impoundment of records ordered under
paragraph (1)(C) that is based upon an ex parte application, notwithstanding the provisions of rule 65
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Any references in paragraphs (2) through (11) of section
34(d) of the Trademark Act to section 32 of such Act shall be read as references to section 501 of
this title, and references to use of a counterfeit mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or
distribution of goods or services shall be read as references to infringement of a copyright.
(b) As part of a final judgment or decree, the court may order the destruction or other reasonable
disposition of all copies or phonorecords found to have been made or used in violation of the
copyright owner's exclusive rights, and of all plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives,
or other articles by means of which such copies or phonorecords may be reproduced.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
The two subsections of section 503 deal respectively with the courts' power to impound allegedly infringing
articles during the time an action is pending, and to order the destruction or other disposition of articles found
to be infringing. In both cases the articles affected include "all copies or phonorecords" which are claimed or
found "to have been made or used in violation of the copyright owner's exclusive rights," and also "all plates,
molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or other articles by means of which such copies of
phonorecords may be reproduced." The alternative phrase "made or used" in both subsections enables a court
to deal as it sees fit with articles which, though reproduced and acquired lawfully, have been used for
infringing purposes such as rentals, performances, and displays.
Articles may be impounded under subsection (a) "at any time while an action under this title is pending,"
thus permitting seizures of articles alleged to be infringing as soon as suit has been filed and without waiting
for an injunction. The same subsection empowers the court to order impounding "on such terms as it may
deem reasonable." The present Supreme Court rules with respect to seizure and impounding were issued even
though there is no specific provision authorizing them in the copyright statute, and there appears no need for
including a special provision on the point in the bill.
Under section 101(d) of the present statute [section 101(d) of former title 17], articles found to be infringing
may be ordered to be delivered up for destruction. Section 503(b) of the bill would make this provision more
flexible by giving the court discretion to order "destruction or other reasonable disposition" of the articles
found to be infringing. Thus, as part of its final judgment or decree, the court could order the infringing
articles sold, delivered to the plaintiff, or disposed of in some other way that would avoid needless waste and
best serve the ends of justice.

§504. Remedies for infringement: Damages and profits
(a) IN GENERAL.—Except as otherwise provided by this title, an infringer of copyright is liable
for either—
(1) the copyright owner's actual damages and any additional profits of the infringer, as provided
by subsection (b); or
(2) statutory damages, as provided by subsection (c).
(b) ACTUAL DAMAGES AND PROFITS.—The copyright owner is entitled to recover the actual
damages suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement, and any profits of the infringer that
are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.
In establishing the infringer's profits, the copyright owner is required to present proof only of the
infringer's gross revenue, and the infringer is required to prove his or her deductible expenses and the
elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work.
(c) STATUTORY DAMAGES.—
(1) Except as provided by clause (2) of this subsection, the copyright owner may elect, at any
time before final judgment is rendered, to recover, instead of actual damages and profits, an award
of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action, with respect to any one work, for
which any one infringer is liable individually, or for which any two or more infringers are liable
jointly and severally, in a sum of not less than $750 or more than $30,000 as the court considers
just. For the purposes of this subsection, all the parts of a compilation or derivative work
constitute one work.
(2) In a case where the copyright owner sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that
infringement was committed willfully, the court in its discretion may increase the award of
statutory damages to a sum of not more than $150,000. In a case where the infringer sustains the
burden of proving, and the court finds, that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to
believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright, the court in its discretion may
reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than $200. The court shall remit
statutory damages in any case where an infringer believed and had reasonable grounds for
believing that his or her use of the copyrighted work was a fair use under section 107, if the
infringer was: (i) an employee or agent of a nonprofit educational institution, library, or archives
acting within the scope of his or her employment who, or such institution, library, or archives
itself, which infringed by reproducing the work in copies or phonorecords; or (ii) a public
broadcasting entity which or a person who, as a regular part of the nonprofit activities of a public
[Release Point 118-106]
broadcasting entity (as defined in section 118(f)) infringed by performing a published nondramatic
literary work or by reproducing a transmission program embodying a performance of such a work.
(3)(A) In a case of infringement, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that the infringement was
committed willfully for purposes of determining relief if the violator, or a person acting in concert
with the violator, knowingly provided or knowingly caused to be provided materially false contact
information to a domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name registration
authority in registering, maintaining, or renewing a domain name used in connection with the
infringement.
(B) Nothing in this paragraph limits what may be considered willful infringement under this
subsection.
(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "domain name" has the meaning given that term in
section 45 of the Act entitled "An Act to provide for the registration and protection of trademarks
used in commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain international conventions, and for other
purposes" approved July 5, 1946 (commonly referred to as the "Trademark Act of 1946"; 15
U.S.C. 1127).
(d) ADDITIONAL DAMAGES IN CERTAIN CASES.—In any case in which the court finds that
a defendant proprietor of an establishment who claims as a defense that its activities were exempt
under section 110(5) did not have reasonable grounds to believe that its use of a copyrighted work
was exempt under such section, the plaintiff shall be entitled to, in addition to any award of damages
under this section, an additional award of two times the amount of the license fee that the proprietor
of the establishment concerned should have paid the plaintiff for such use during the preceding
period of up to 3 years.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
In General. A cornerstone of the remedies sections and of the bill as a whole is section 504, the provision
dealing with recovery of actual damages, profits, and statutory damages. The two basic aims of this section are
reciprocal and correlative: (1) to give the courts specific unambiguous directions concerning monetary awards,
thus avoiding the confusion and uncertainty that have marked the present law on the subject, and, at the same
time, (2) to provide the courts with reasonable latitude to adjust recovery to the circumstances of the case, thus
avoiding some of the artificial or overly technical awards resulting from the language of the existing statute.
Subsection (a) lays the groundwork for the more detailed provisions of the section by establishing the
liability of a copyright infringer for either "the copyright owner's actual damages and any additional profits of
the infringer," or statutory damages. Recovery of actual damages and profits under section 504(b) or of
statutory damages under section 504(c) is alternative and for the copyright owner to elect; as under the present
law, the plaintiff in an infringement suit is not obliged to submit proof of damages and profits and may choose
to rely on the provision for minimum statutory damages. However, there is nothing in section 504 to prevent a
court from taking account of evidence concerning actual damages and profits in making an award of statutory
damages within the range set out in subsection (c).
Actual Damages and Profits. In allowing the plaintiff to recover "the actual damages suffered by him or
her as a result of the infringement," plus any of the infringer's profits "that are attributable to the infringement
and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages," section 504(b) recognizes the different
purposes served by awards of damages and profits. Damages are awarded to compensate the copyright owner
for losses from the infringement, and profits are awarded to prevent the infringer from unfairly benefiting
from a wrongful act. Where the defendant's profits are nothing more than a measure of the damages suffered
by the copyright owner, it would be inappropriate to award damages and profits cumulatively, since in effect
they amount to the same thing. However, in cases where the copyright owner has suffered damages not
reflected in the infringer's profits, or where there have been profits attributable to the copyrighted work but not
used as a measure of damages, subsection (b) authorizes the award of both.
[Release Point 118-106]
The language of the subsection makes clear that only those profits "attributable to the infringement" are
recoverable; where some of the defendant's profits result from the infringement and other profits are caused by
different factors, it will be necessary for the court to make an apportionment. However, the burden of proof is
on the defendant in these cases; in establishing profits the plaintiff need prove only "the infringer's gross
revenue," and the defendant must prove not only "his or her deductible expenses" but also "the element of
profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work."
Statutory Damages. Subsection (c) of section 504 makes clear that the plaintiff's election to recover
statutory damages may take place at any time during the trial before the court has rendered its final judgment.
The remainder of clause (1) of the subsection represents a statement of the general rates applicable to awards
of statutory damages. Its principal provisions may be summarized as follows:
1. As a general rule, where the plaintiff elects to recover statutory damages, the court is obliged to
award between $250 and $10,000. It can exercise discretion in awarding an amount within that range but,
unless one of the exceptions provided by clause (2) is applicable, it cannot make an award of less than $250
or of more than $10,000 if the copyright owner has chosen recovery under section 504(c).
2. Although, as explained below, an award of minimum statutory damages may be multiplied if
separate works and separately liable infringers are involved in the suit, a single award in the $250 to
$10,000 range is to be made "for all infringements involved in the action." A single infringer of a single
work is liable for a single amount between $250 and $10,000, no matter how many acts of infringement are
involved in the action and regardless of whether the acts were separate, isolated, or occurred in a related
series.
3. Where the suit involves infringement of more than one separate and independent work, minimum
statutory damages for each work must be awarded. For example, if one defendant has infringed three
copyrighted works, the copyright owner is entitled to statutory damages of at least $750 and may be
awarded up to $30,000. Subsection (c)(1) makes clear, however, that, although they are regarded as
independent works for other purposes, "all the parts of a compilation or derivative work constitute one
work" for this purpose. Moreover, although the minimum and maximum amounts are to be multiplied
where multiple "works" are involved in the suit, the same is not true with respect to multiple copyrights,
multiple owners, multiple exclusive rights, or multiple registrations. This point is especially important
since, under a scheme of divisible copyright, it is possible to have the rights of a number of owners of
separate "copyrights" in a single "work" infringed by one act of a defendant.
4. Where the infringements of one work were committed by a single infringer acting individually, a
single award of statutory damages would be made. Similarly, where the work was infringed by two or more
joint tortfeasors, the bill would make them jointly and severally liable for an amount in the $250 to $10,000
range. However, where separate infringements for which two or more defendants are not jointly liable are
joined in the same action, separate awards of statutory damages would be appropriate.
Clause (2) of section 504(c) provides for exceptional cases in which the maximum award of statutory
damages could be raised from $10,000 to $50,000, and in which the minimum recovery could be reduced from
$250 to $100. The basic principle underlying this provision is that the courts should be given discretion to
increase statutory damages in cases of willful infringement and to lower the minimum where the infringer is
innocent. The language of the clause makes clear that in these situations the burden of proving willfulness
rests on the copyright owner and that of proving innocence rests on the infringer, and that the court must make
a finding of either willfulness or innocence in order to award the exceptional amounts.
The "innocent infringer" provision of section 504(c)(2) has been the subject of extensive discussion. The
exception, which would allow reduction of minimum statutory damages to $100 where the infringer "was not
aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright," is sufficient
to protect against unwarranted liability in cases of occasional or isolated innocent infringement, and it offers
adequate insulation to users, such as broadcasters and newspaper publishers, who are particularly vulnerable
to this type of infringement suit. On the other hand, by establishing a realistic floor for liability, the provision
preserves its intended deterrent effect; and it would not allow an infringer to escape simply because the
plaintiff failed to disprove the defendant's claim of innocence.
In addition to the general "innocent infringer" provision clause (2) deals with the special situation of
teachers, librarians, archivists, and public broadcasters, and the nonprofit institutions of which they are a part.
Section 504(c)(2) provides that, where such a person or institution infringed copyrighted material in the honest
belief that what they were doing constituted fair use, the court is precluded from awarding any statutory
damages. It is intended that, in cases involving this provision, the burden of proof with respect to the
defendant's good faith should rest on the plaintiff.

HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Four types of criminal offenses actionable under the bill are listed in section 506: willful infringement for
profit, fraudulent use of a copyright notice, fraudulent removal of notice, and false representation in
connection with a copyright application. The maximum fine on conviction has been increased to $10,000 and,
in conformity with the general pattern of the Criminal Code (18 U.S.C.), no minimum fines have been
provided. In addition to or instead of a fine, conviction for criminal infringement under section 506(a) can
carry with it a sentence of imprisonment of up to one year. Section 506(b) deals with seizure, forfeiture, and
destruction of material involved in cases of criminal infringement.
Section 506(a) contains a special provision applying to any person who infringes willfully and for purposes
of commercial advantage the copyright in a sound recording or a motion picture. For the first such offense a

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Section 509(b) specifies a new discretionary remedy for alteration of programming by cable systems in
violation of section 111(c)(3): the court in such cases may decree that, "for a period not to exceed thirty days,
the cable system shall be deprived of the benefit of a compulsory license for one or more distant signals
[Release Point 118-106]
carried by such cable system." The term "distant signals" in this provision is intended to have a meaning
consistent with the definition of "distant signal equivalent" in section 111.
Under section 509(a), four types of plaintiffs are entitled to bring an action in cases of alteration of
programming by cable systems in violation of section 111(c)(3). For regular copyright owners and local
broadcaster-licensees, the full battery of remedies for infringement would be available. The two new classes of
potential plaintiffs under section 501(d)—the distant-signal transmitter and other local stations—would be
limited to the following remedies: (i) discretionary injunctions; (ii) discretionary costs and attorney's fees; (iii)
any actual damages the plaintiff can prove were attributable to the act of altering program content; and (iv) the
new discretionary remedy of suspension of compulsory licensing.

State or instrumentality of a State acting in his or her official capacity, shall not be immune, under
the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States or under any other doctrine of
sovereign immunity, from suit in Federal court by any person, including any governmental or
nongovernmental entity, for a violation of any of the exclusive rights of a copyright owner provided
by sections 106 through 122, for importing copies of phonorecords in violation of section 602, or for
any other violation under this title.
(b) REMEDIES.—In a suit described in subsection (a) for a violation described in that subsection,
remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) are available for the violation to the same

official capacity. Such remedies include impounding and disposition of infringing articles under
section 503, actual damages and profits and statutory damages under section 504, costs and
attorney's fees under section 505, and the remedies provided in section 510.

relief, for infringement of copyright by reason of the provider's transmitting, routing, or providing
connections for, material through a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service
provider, or by reason of the intermediate and transient storage of that material in the course of such
transmitting, routing, or providing connections, if—

service provider;
(2) the transmission, routing, provision of connections, or storage is carried out through an
automatic technical process without selection of the material by the service provider;

anyone other than anticipated recipients, and no such copy is maintained on the system or network
in a manner ordinarily accessible to such anticipated recipients for a longer period than is
reasonably necessary for the transmission, routing, or provision of connections; and
(5) the material is transmitted through the system or network without modification of its
content.
(b) SYSTEM CACHING.—
(1) LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.—A service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief,
or, except as provided in subsection (j), for injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement of

(A) the material is made available online by a person other than the service provider;
(B) the material is transmitted from the person described in subparagraph (A) through the
system or network to a person other than the person described in subparagraph (A) at the

if the conditions set forth in paragraph (2) are met.
(2) CONDITIONS.—The conditions referred to in paragraph (1) are that—

to which this subsection applies;
(C) the service provider does not interfere with the ability of technology associated with the

network or with the intermediate storage of the material;
(ii) is consistent with generally accepted industry standard communications protocols; and

student shall be considered to be a person other than the institution, and for the purposes of
subsections (c) and (d) such faculty member's or graduate student's knowledge or awareness of his or

shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the alleged
infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner's authorized licensee, or by a service provider,
who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such
misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing,
or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.
(g) REPLACEMENT OF REMOVED OR DISABLED MATERIAL AND LIMITATION ON
OTHER LIABILITY.—
(1) NO LIABILITY FOR TAKING DOWN GENERALLY.—Subject to paragraph (2), a
service provider shall not be liable to any person for any claim based on the service provider's
good faith disabling of access to, or removal of, material or activity claimed to be infringing or

the material or activity is ultimately determined to be infringing.
(2) EXCEPTION.—Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to material residing at the
direction of a subscriber of the service provider on a system or network controlled or operated by
or for the service provider that is removed, or to which access is disabled by the service provider,

responds to the notification.
(6) RULES APPLICABLE TO SUBPOENA.—Unless otherwise provided by this section or by
applicable rules of the court, the procedure for issuance and delivery of the subpoena, and the

this section shall apply to a service provider only if the service provider—
(A) has adopted and reasonably implemented, and informs subscribers and account holders of
the service provider's system or network of, a policy that provides for the termination in
appropriate circumstances of subscribers and account holders of the service provider's system or
network who are repeat infringers; and
(B) accommodates and does not interfere with standard technical measures.
(2) DEFINITION.—As used in this subsection, the term "standard technical measures" means
technical measures that are used by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works
and—
(A) have been developed pursuant to a broad consensus of copyright owners and service
providers in an open, fair, voluntary, multi-industry standards process;
(B) are available to any person on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms; and
(C) do not impose substantial costs on service providers or substantial burdens on their
systems or networks.
(j) INJUNCTIONS.—The following rules shall apply in the case of any application for an
injunction under section 502 against a service provider that is not subject to monetary remedies
under this section:
(1) SCOPE OF RELIEF.—(A) With respect to conduct other than that which qualifies for the
limitation on remedies set forth in subsection (a), the court may grant injunctive relief with respect
to a service provider only in one or more of the following forms:
(i) An order restraining the service provider from providing access to infringing material or
activity residing at a particular online site on the provider's system or network.
(ii) An order restraining the service provider from providing access to a subscriber or account
holder of the service provider's system or network who is engaging in infringing activity and is
identified in the order, by terminating the accounts of the subscriber or account holder that are
specified in the order.
(iii) Such other injunctive relief as the court may consider necessary to prevent or restrain
infringement of copyrighted material specified in the order of the court at a particular online
location, if such relief is the least burdensome to the service provider among the forms of relief
comparably effective for that purpose.
(B) If the service provider qualifies for the limitation on remedies described in subsection (a),
the court may only grant injunctive relief in one or both of the following forms:
(i) An order restraining the service provider from providing access to a subscriber or account
holder of the service provider's system or network who is using the provider's service to engage
in infringing activity and is identified in the order, by terminating the accounts of the subscriber
or account holder that are specified in the order.
(ii) An order restraining the service provider from providing access, by taking reasonable
steps specified in the order to block access, to a specific, identified, online location outside the
United States.
(2) CONSIDERATIONS.—The court, in considering the relevant criteria for injunctive relief
under applicable law, shall consider—
(A) whether such an injunction, either alone or in combination with other such injunctions
issued against the same service provider under this subsection, would significantly burden either
[Release Point 118-106]
the provider or the operation of the provider's system or network;
(B) the magnitude of the harm likely to be suffered by the copyright owner in the digital
network environment if steps are not taken to prevent or restrain the infringement;
(C) whether implementation of such an injunction would be technically feasible and
effective, and would not interfere with access to noninfringing material at other online
locations; and
(D) whether other less burdensome and comparably effective means of preventing or
restraining access to the infringing material are available.
(3) NOTICE AND EX PARTE ORDERS.—Injunctive relief under this subsection shall be
available only after notice to the service provider and an opportunity for the service provider to
appear are provided, except for orders ensuring the preservation of evidence or other orders having
no material adverse effect on the operation of the service provider's communications network.
(k) DEFINITIONS.—
(1) SERVICE PROVIDER.—(A) As used in subsection (a), the term "service provider" means
an entity offering the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online
communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user's choosing,
without modification to the content of the material as sent or received.
(B) As used in this section, other than subsection (a), the term "service provider" means a
provider of online services or network access, or the operator of facilities therefor, and includes an
entity described in subparagraph (A).
(2) MONETARY RELIEF.—As used in this section, the term "monetary relief" means
damages, costs, attorneys' fees, and any other form of monetary payment.
(l) OTHER DEFENSES NOT AFFECTED.—The failure of a service provider's conduct to qualify
for limitation of liability under this section shall not bear adversely upon the consideration of a
defense by the service provider that the service provider's conduct is not infringing under this title or
any other defense.
(m) PROTECTION OF PRIVACY.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to condition the
applicability of subsections (a) through (d) on—
(1) a service provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing
activity, except to the extent consistent with a standard technical measure complying with the
provisions of subsection (i); or
(2) a service provider gaining access to, removing, or disabling access to material in cases in
which such conduct is prohibited by law.
(n) CONSTRUCTION.—Subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) describe separate and distinct functions
for purposes of applying this section. Whether a service provider qualifies for the limitation on
liability in any one of those subsections shall be based solely on the criteria in that subsection, and
shall not affect a determination of whether that service provider qualifies for the limitations on
liability under any other such subsection.

§513. Determination of reasonable license fees for individual proprietors
In the case of any performing rights society subject to a consent decree which provides for the
determination of reasonable license rates or fees to be charged by the performing rights society,
notwithstanding the provisions of that consent decree, an individual proprietor who owns or operates
fewer than 7 non-publicly traded establishments in which nondramatic musical works are performed
publicly and who claims that any license agreement offered by that performing rights society is
unreasonable in its license rate or fee as to that individual proprietor, shall be entitled to
determination of a reasonable license rate or fee as follows:
(1) The individual proprietor may commence such proceeding for determination of a reasonable
license rate or fee by filing an application in the applicable district court under paragraph (2) that a
rate disagreement exists and by serving a copy of the application on the performing rights society.
Such proceeding shall commence in the applicable district court within 90 days after the service of
such copy, except that such 90-day requirement shall be subject to the administrative requirements
of the court.
(2) The proceeding under paragraph (1) shall be held, at the individual proprietor's election, in
the judicial district of the district court with jurisdiction over the applicable consent decree or in
that place of holding court of a district court that is the seat of the Federal circuit (other than the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) in which the proprietor's establishment is located.
(3) Such proceeding shall be held before the judge of the court with jurisdiction over the
consent decree governing the performing rights society. At the discretion of the court, the
proceeding shall be held before a special master or magistrate judge appointed by such judge.
Should that consent decree provide for the appointment of an advisor or advisors to the court for
any purpose, any such advisor shall be the special master so named by the court.
(4) In any such proceeding, the industry rate shall be presumed to have been reasonable at the
time it was agreed to or determined by the court. Such presumption shall in no way affect a
determination of whether the rate is being correctly applied to the individual proprietor.
(5) Pending the completion of such proceeding, the individual proprietor shall have the right to
perform publicly the copyrighted musical compositions in the repertoire of the performing rights
society by paying an interim license rate or fee into an interest bearing escrow account with the
clerk of the court, subject to retroactive adjustment when a final rate or fee has been determined,
in an amount equal to the industry rate, or, in the absence of an industry rate, the amount of the
most recent license rate or fee agreed to by the parties.
(6) Any decision rendered in such proceeding by a special master or magistrate judge named
under paragraph (3) shall be reviewed by the judge of the court with jurisdiction over the consent
decree governing the performing rights society. Such proceeding, including such review, shall be
concluded within 6 months after its commencement.
[Release Point 118-106]
(7) Any such final determination shall be binding only as to the individual proprietor
commencing the proceeding, and shall not be applicable to any other proprietor or any other
performing rights society, and the performing rights society shall be relieved of any obligation of
nondiscrimination among similarly situated music users that may be imposed by the consent
decree governing its operations.
(8) An individual proprietor may not bring more than one proceeding provided for in this
section for the determination of a reasonable license rate or fee under any license agreement with
respect to any one performing rights society.
(9) For purposes of this section, the term "industry rate" means the license fee a performing
rights society has agreed to with, or which has been determined by the court for, a significant
segment of the music user industry to which the individual proprietor belongs.

§602. Infringing importation or exportation of copies or phonorecords
(a) INFRINGING IMPORTATION OR EXPORTATION.—
(1) IMPORTATION.—Importation into the United States, without the authority of the owner of
copyright under this title, of copies or phonorecords of a work that have been acquired outside the
United States is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords under
section 106, actionable under section 501.
(2) IMPORTATION OR EXPORTATION OF INFRINGING ITEMS.—Importation into the
United States or exportation from the United States, without the authority of the owner of
copyright under this title, of copies or phonorecords, the making of which either constituted an
infringement of copyright, or which would have constituted an infringement of copyright if this
title had been applicable, is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies or
phonorecords under section 106, actionable under sections 501 and 506.
(3) EXCEPTIONS.—This subsection does not apply to—
(A) importation or exportation of copies or phonorecords under the authority or for the use of
the Government of the United States or of any State or political subdivision of a State, but not
including copies or phonorecords for use in schools, or copies of any audiovisual work imported
for purposes other than archival use;
(B) importation or exportation, for the private use of the importer or exporter and not for
distribution, by any person with respect to no more than one copy or phonorecord of any one
work at any one time, or by any person arriving from outside the United States or departing
from the United States with respect to copies or phonorecords forming part of such person's
personal baggage; or
(C) importation by or for an organization operated for scholarly, educational, or religious
purposes and not for private gain, with respect to no more than one copy of an audiovisual work
solely for its archival purposes, and no more than five copies or phonorecords of any other work
for its library lending or archival purposes, unless the importation of such copies or
phonorecords is part of an activity consisting of systematic reproduction or distribution,
engaged in by such organization in violation of the provisions of section 108(g)(2).
(b) IMPORT PROHIBITION.—In a case where the making of the copies or phonorecords would
have constituted an infringement of copyright if this title had been applicable, their importation is
prohibited. In a case where the copies or phonorecords were lawfully made, United States Customs
and Border Protection has no authority to prevent their importation. In either case, the Secretary of
the Treasury is authorized to prescribe, by regulation, a procedure under which any person claiming
an interest in the copyright in a particular work may, upon payment of a specified fee, be entitled to
notification by United States Customs and Border Protection of the importation of articles that
appear to be copies or phonorecords of the work.

HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Scope of the Section. Section 602, which has nothing to do with the manufacturing requirements of section
601, deals with two separate situations: importation of "piratical" articles (that is, copies or phonorecords
made without any authorization of the copyright owner), and unauthorized importation of copies or
phonorecords that were lawfully made. The general approach of section 602 is to make unauthorized
importation an act of infringement in both cases, but to permit the United States Customs Service to prohibit
importation only of "piratical" articles.
Section 602(a) first states the general rule that unauthorized importation is an infringement merely if the
copies or phonorecords "have been acquired outside the United States", but then enumerates three specific
exceptions: (1) importation under the authority or for the use of a governmental body, but not including
material for use in schools or copies of an audiovisual work imported for any purpose other than archival use;
(2) importation for the private use of the importer of no more than one copy or phonorecord of a work at a
[Release Point 118-106]
time, or of articles in the personal baggage of travelers from abroad; or (3) importation by nonprofit
organizations "operated for scholarly, educational, or religious purposes" of "no more than one copy of an
audiovisual work solely for archival purposes, and no more than five copies or phonorecords of any other
work for its library lending or archival purposes." The bill specifies that the third exception does not apply if
the importation "is part of an activity consisting of systematic reproduction or distribution, engaged in by such
organization in violation of the provisions of section 108(g)(2)."
If none of the three exemptions applies, any unauthorized importer of copies or phonorecords acquired
abroad could be sued for damages and enjoined from making any use of them, even before any public
distribution in this country has taken place.
Importation of "Piratical" Copies. Section 602(b) retains the present statute's prohibition against
importation of "piratical" copies or phonorecords—those whose making "would have constituted an
infringement of copyright if this title has been applicable." Thus, the Customs Service could exclude copies or
phonorecords that were unlawful in the country where they were made; it could also exclude copies or
phonorecords which, although made lawfully under the domestic law of that country, would have been
unlawful if the U.S. copyright law could have been applied. A typical example would be a work by an
American author which is in the public domain in a foreign country because that country does not have
copyright relations with the United States; the making and publication of an authorized edition would be
lawful in that country, but the Customs Service could prevent the importation of any copies of that edition.
Importation for Infringing Distribution. The second situation covered by section 602 is that where the
copies or phonorecords were lawfully made but their distribution in the United States would infringe the U.S.
copyright owner's exclusive rights. As already said, the mere act of importation in this situation would
constitute an act of infringement and could be enjoined. However, in cases of this sort it would be
impracticable for the United States Customs Service to attempt to enforce the importation prohibition, and
section 602(b) provides that, unless a violation of the manufacturing requirements is also involved, the Service
has no authority to prevent importation, "where the copies or phonorecords were lawfully made." The
subsection would authorize the establishment of a procedure under which copyright owners could arrange for
the Customs Service to notify them wherever articles appearing to infringe their works are imported.

§603. Importation prohibitions: Enforcement and disposition of excluded articles
(a) The Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Postal Service shall separately or jointly
make regulations for the enforcement of the provisions of this title prohibiting importation.
(b) These regulations may require, as a condition for the exclusion of articles under section 602—
(1) that the person seeking exclusion obtain a court order enjoining importation of the articles;
or
(2) that the person seeking exclusion furnish proof, of a specified nature and in accordance with
prescribed procedures, that the copyright in which such person claims an interest is valid and that
[Release Point 118-106]
the importation would violate the prohibition in section 602; the person seeking exclusion may
also be required to post a surety bond for any injury that may result if the detention or exclusion of
the articles proves to be unjustified.
(c) Articles imported in violation of the importation prohibitions of this title are subject to seizure
and forfeiture in the same manner as property imported in violation of the customs revenue laws.
Forfeited articles shall be destroyed as directed by the Secretary of the Treasury or the court, as the
case may be.

The importation prohibitions of both sections 601 and 602 would be enforced under section 603, which is
similar to section 109 of the statute now in effect [section 109 of former title 17]. Subsection (a) would
authorize the Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Postal Service to make regulations for this
purpose, and subsection (c) provides for the disposition of excluded articles.
Subsection (b) of section 603 deals only with the prohibition against importation of "piratical" copies or
phonorecords, and is aimed at solving problems that have arisen under the present statute. Since the United
States Customs Service is often in no position to make determinations as to whether particular articles are
"piratical," section 603(b) would permit the Customs regulations to require the person seeking exclusion either
to obtain a court order enjoining importation, or to furnish proof of his claim and to post bond.

HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476
Chapter 7 entitled "Copyright Office," sets forth the administrative and housekeeping provisions of the bill.
Administrative Procedure Act. Under an amendment to section 701 adopted by the Committee, the
Copyright Office is made fully subject to the Administrative Procedure Act [5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. and 701 et
seq.] with one exception: under section 706(b), reproduction and distribution of copyright deposit copies
would be made under the Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552] only to the extent permitted by the
Copyright Office regulations.
Retention and Disposition of Deposited Articles. A recurring problem in the administration of the
copyright law has been the need to reconcile the storage limitations of the Copyright Office with the continued
[Release Point 118-106]
value of deposits in identifying copyrighted works. Aside from its indisputable utility to future historians and
scholars, a substantially complete collection of both published and unpublished deposits, other than those
selected by the Library of Congress, would avoid the many difficulties encountered when copies needed for
identification in connection with litigation or other purposes have been destroyed. The basic policy behind
section 704 is that copyright deposits should be retained as long as possible, but that the Register of
Copyrights and the Librarian of Congress should be empowered to dispose of them under appropriate
safeguards when they decide that it has become necessary to do so.
Under subsection (a) of section 704, any copy, phonorecord, or identifying material deposited for
registration, whether registered or not, becomes "the property of the United States Government." This means
that the copyright owner or person who made the deposit cannot demand its return as a matter of right, even in
rejection cases, although the provisions of section 407 and 408 are flexible enough to allow for special
arrangements in exceptional cases. On the other hand, Government ownership of deposited articles under
section 704(a) carries with it no privileges under the copyright itself; use of a deposited article in violation of
the copyright owner's exclusive rights would be infringement.
With respect to published works, section 704(b) makes all deposits available to the Library of Congress "for
its collections, or for exchanges or transfer to any other library"; where the work is unpublished, the Library is
authorized to select any deposit for its own collections or for transfer to the National Archives of the United
States or to a Federal records center.
Motion picture producers have expressed some concern lest the right to transfer copies of works, such as
motion pictures, that have been published under rental, lease, or loan arrangements, might lead to abuse.
However, the Library of Congress has not knowingly transferred works of this sort to other libraries in the
past, and there is no reason to expect it to do so in the future.
The Committee added a new subsection (c) to section 704, under which the Register is authorized to make
microfilm or other record copies of copyright deposits before transferring or otherwise disposing of them.
For deposits not selected by the Library, subsection (d) provides that they, or "identifying portions or
reproductions of them," are to be retained under Copyright Office control "for the longest period considered
practicable and desirable" by the Register and the Librarian. When and if they ultimately decide that retention
of certain deposited articles is no longer "practicable and desirable," the Register and Librarian have joint
discretion to order their "destruction or other disposition." Because of the unique value and irreplaceable
nature of unpublished deposits, the subsection prohibits their intentional destruction during their copyright
term, unless a facsimile reproduction has been made.
Subsection (e) of section 704 establishes a new procedure under which a copyright owner can request
retention of deposited material for the full term of copyright. The Register of Copyrights is authorized to issue
regulations prescribing the fees for this service and the "conditions under which such requests are to be made
and granted."
Catalog of Copyright Entries. Section 707(a) of the bill retains the present statute's basis requirement that
the Register compile and publish catalogs of all copyright registrations at periodic intervals, but provides for
"discretion to determine, on the basis of practicability and usefulness the form and frequency of publication of
each particular part". This provision will in no way diminish the utility or value of the present catalogs, and
the flexibility of approach, coupled with use of the new mechanical and electronic devices now becoming
available, will avoid waste and result in a better product.
Copyright Office Fees. The schedule of fees set out in section 708 reflects a general increase in the fees of
the Copyright Office from those established by the Congress in 1965. The basic fees are $10 for registration,
$6 for renewal registration, $10 for recordation of documents and $10 per hour for searching. The section also
contains new fee provisions needed because of new requirements or services established under the bill, and
subsection (a)(11) authorizes the Register to fix additional fees, on the "basis of the cost of providing the
service," "for any other special services requiring a substantial amount of time or expense." Subsection (b)
makes clear that, except for the possibility of waivers in "occasional or isolated cases involving relatively
small amounts," the Register is to charge fees for services rendered to other Government agencies.
Postal Interruptions. Section 709 authorizes the Register of Copyrights to issue regulation to permit the
acceptance by the Copyright Office of documents which are delivered after the close of the prescribed period
if the delay was caused by a general disruption or suspension of postal or other transportation or
communications services.
Reproductions for the Blind and Handicapped. Section 710 directs the Register of Copyrights to
establish by regulation forms and procedures by which the copyright owners of certain categories of works
may voluntarily grant to the Library of Congress a license to reproduce and distribute copies or phonorecords
of the work solely for the use of the blind and physically handicapped.

under section 304(a), including the issuance of a certificate of registration if registration is made;

(4) for the recordation, as provided by section 205, of a transfer of copyright ownership or other
document;
(5) for the filing, under section 115(b),1 of a notice of intention to obtain a compulsory license;
(6) for the recordation, under section 302(c), of a statement revealing the identity of an author
of an anonymous or pseudonymous work, or for the recordation, under section 302(d), of a
statement relating to the death of an author;

(11) on filing a statement of account based on secondary transmissions of primary transmissions
pursuant to section 111.
The Register is authorized to fix fees for other services, including the cost of preparing copies of

service. Fees established under paragraphs (10) and (11) shall be reasonable and may not exceed
one-half of the cost necessary to cover reasonable expenses incurred by the Copyright Office for the
collection and administration of the statements of account and any royalty fees deposited with such
statements.
(b) ADJUSTMENT OF FEES.—The Register of Copyrights may, by regulation, adjust the fees
for the services specified in paragraphs (1) through (9) of subsection (a) in the following manner:
(1) The Register shall conduct a study of the costs incurred by the Copyright Office for the
registration of claims, the recordation of documents, and the provision of services. The study shall
also consider the timing of any adjustment in fees and the authority to use such fees consistent
with the budget.
(2) The Register may, on the basis of the study under paragraph (1), and subject to paragraph
(5), adjust fees to not more than that necessary to cover the reasonable costs incurred by the
Copyright Office for the services described in paragraph (1), plus a reasonable inflation
adjustment to account for any estimated increase in costs.
(3) Any fee established under paragraph (2) shall be rounded off to the nearest dollar, or for a
fee less than $12, rounded off to the nearest 50 cents.
(4) Fees established under this subsection shall be fair and equitable and give due consideration
to the objectives of the copyright system.
(5) If the Register determines under paragraph (2) that fees should be adjusted, the Register
shall prepare a proposed fee schedule and submit the schedule with the accompanying economic
[Release Point 118-106]
analysis to the Congress. The fees proposed by the Register may be instituted after the end of 120
days after the schedule is submitted to the Congress unless, within that 120-day period, a law is
enacted stating in substance that the Congress does not approve the schedule.
(c) The fees prescribed by or under this section are applicable to the United States Government
and any of its agencies, employees, or officers, but the Register of Copyrights has discretion to waive
the requirement of this subsection in occasional or isolated cases involving relatively small amounts.
(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), all fees received under this section shall be deposited
by the Register of Copyrights in the Treasury of the United States and shall be credited to the
appropriations for necessary expenses of the Copyright Office. Such fees that are collected shall
remain available until expended. The Register may, in accordance with regulations that he or she
shall prescribe, refund any sum paid by mistake or in excess of the fee required by this section.
(2) In the case of fees deposited against future services, the Register of Copyrights shall request
the Secretary of the Treasury to invest in interest-bearing securities in the United States Treasury any
portion of the fees that, as determined by the Register, is not required to meet current deposit account
demands. Funds from such portion of fees shall be invested in securities that permit funds to be
available to the Copyright Office at all times if they are determined to be necessary to meet current
deposit account demands. Such investments shall be in public debt securities with maturities suitable
to the needs of the Copyright Office, as determined by the Register of Copyrights, and bearing
interest at rates determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration current market
yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities.
(3) The income on such investments shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States and
shall be credited to the appropriations for necessary expenses of the Copyright Office.
(e)(1) In this subsection, the term "covered competition" means—
(A) an art competition sponsored by the Congressional Institute that is open only to high school
students; or
(B) the competition established under section 3 of House Resolution 77, 113th Congress, agreed
to February 26, 2013.
(2) With respect to a work that wins a covered competition, the Register of Copyrights—
(A) shall waive the requirement under subsection (a)(1) with respect to an application for
registration of a copyright claim for that work if that application is submitted to the Copyright
Office not later than the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the work claimed
by the application wins the covered competition (referred to in this paragraph as the "covered
year"); and
(B) may waive a fee described in subparagraph (A) for an application submitted after the end of
the covered year if the fee would have been waived under that subparagraph had the application
been submitted before the last day of the covered year.

§709. Delay in delivery caused by disruption of postal or other services
In any case in which the Register of Copyrights determines, on the basis of such evidence as the
Register may by regulation require, that a deposit, application, fee, or any other material to be
delivered to the Copyright Office by a particular date, would have been received in the Copyright
Office in due time except for a general disruption or suspension of postal or other transportation or
communications services, the actual receipt of such material in the Copyright Office within one
month after the date on which the Register determines that the disruption or suspension of such
services has terminated, shall be considered timely.
(Pub. L. 94–553, title I, §101, Oct. 19, 1976, 90 Stat. 2594.)
§710. Emergency relief authority
(a) EMERGENCY ACTION.—If, on or before December 31, 2021, the Register of Copyrights
determines that a national emergency declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act
(50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) generally disrupts or suspends the ordinary functioning of the copyright
system under this title, or any component thereof, including on a regional basis, the Register may, on
a temporary basis, toll, waive, adjust, or modify any timing provision (including any deadline or
effective period, except as provided in subsection (c)) or procedural provision contained in this title
or chapters II or III of title 37, Code of Federal Regulations, for no longer than the Register
reasonably determines to be appropriate to mitigate the impact of the disruption caused by the
national emergency. In taking such action, the Register shall consider the scope and severity of the
particular national emergency, and its specific effect with respect to the particular provision, and
shall tailor any remedy accordingly.
(b) NOTICE AND EFFECT.—Any action taken by the Register in response to a national
emergency pursuant to subsection (a) shall not be subject to section 701(e) or subchapter II of
chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, and chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The provision of
general public notice detailing the action being taken by the Register in response to the national
[Release Point 118-106]
emergency under subsection (a) is sufficient to effectuate such action. The Register may make such
action effective both prospectively and retroactively in relation to a particular provision as the
Register determines to be appropriate based on the timing, scope, and nature of the public
emergency, but any action by the Register may only be retroactive with respect to a deadline that has
not already passed before the declaration described in subsection (a).
(c) STATEMENT REQUIRED.—Except as provided in subsection (d), not later than 20 days
after taking any action that results in a provision being modified for a cumulative total of longer than
120 days, the Register shall submit to Congress a statement detailing the action taken, the relevant
background, and rationale for the action.
(d) EXCEPTIONS.—The authority of the Register to act under subsection (a) does not extend 1
provisions under this title requiring the commencement of an action or proceeding in Federal court
within a specified period of time, except that if the Register adjusts the license availability date
defined in section 115(e)(15), such adjustment shall not affect the ability to commence actions for
any claim of infringement of exclusive rights provided by paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 106
against a digital music provider arising from the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of a
musical work by such digital music provider in the course of engaging in covered activities that
accrued after January 1, 2018, provided that such action is commenced within the time periods
prescribed under section 115(d)(10)(C)(i) or 115(d)(10)(C)(ii) as calculated from the adjusted license
availability date. If the Register adjusts the license availability date, the Register must provide the
statement to Congress under subsection (c) at the same time as the public notice of such adjustment
with a detailed explanation of why such adjustment is needed.
(e) COPYRIGHT TERM EXCEPTION.—The authority of the Register to act under subsection (a)
does not extend to provisions under chapter 3, except section 304(c), or section 1401(a)(2).
(f) OTHER LAWS.—Notwithstanding section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C.
1631), the authority of the Register under subsection (a) is not contingent on a specification made by
the President under such section or any other requirement under that Act (other than the emergency
declaration under section 201(a) of such Act (50 U.S.C. 1621(a))). The authority described in this
section supersedes the authority of title II of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.).

§801. Copyright Royalty Judges; appointment and functions
(a) APPOINTMENT.—The Librarian of Congress shall appoint 3 full-time Copyright Royalty
Judges, and shall appoint 1 of the 3 as the Chief Copyright Royalty Judge. The Librarian shall make
appointments to such positions after consultation with the Register of Copyrights.
(b) FUNCTIONS.—Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the functions of the Copyright
Royalty Judges shall be as follows:
(1) To make determinations and adjustments of reasonable terms and rates of royalty payments
as provided in sections 112(e), 114, 115, 116, 118, 119, and 1004.
(2) To make determinations concerning the adjustment of the copyright royalty rates under
section 111 solely in accordance with the following provisions:
(A) The rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be adjusted to reflect—
(i) national monetary inflation or deflation; or
(ii) changes in the average rates charged cable subscribers for the basic service of
providing secondary transmissions to maintain the real constant dollar level of the royalty fee
per subscriber which existed as of the date of October 19, 1976,
except that—
(I) if the average rates charged cable system subscribers for the basic service of providing
secondary transmissions are changed so that the average rates exceed national monetary
inflation, no change in the rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) shall be permitted; and
(II) no increase in the royalty fee shall be permitted based on any reduction in the average
number of distant signal equivalents per subscriber.
The Copyright Royalty Judges may consider all factors relating to the maintenance of such level
of payments, including, as an extenuating factor, whether the industry has been restrained by
subscriber rate regulating authorities from increasing the rates for the basic service of providing
secondary transmissions.
(B) In the event that the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission
are amended at any time after April 15, 1976, to permit the carriage by cable systems of
additional television broadcast signals beyond the local service area of the primary transmitters
[Release Point 118-106]
of such signals, the royalty rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be adjusted to ensure
that the rates for the additional distant signal equivalents resulting from such carriage are
reasonable in the light of the changes effected by the amendment to such rules and regulations.
In determining the reasonableness of rates proposed following an amendment of Federal
Communications Commission rules and regulations, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall
consider, among other factors, the economic impact on copyright owners and users; except that
no adjustment in royalty rates shall be made under this subparagraph with respect to any distant
signal equivalent or fraction thereof represented by—
(i) carriage of any signal permitted under the rules and regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission in effect on April 15, 1976, or the carriage of a signal of the
same type (that is, independent, network, or noncommercial educational) substituted for such
permitted signal; or
(ii) a television broadcast signal first carried after April 15, 1976, pursuant to an individual
waiver of the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, as such
rules and regulations were in effect on April 15, 1976.
(C) In the event of any change in the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications
Commission with respect to syndicated and sports program exclusivity after April 15, 1976, the
rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be adjusted to assure that such rates are
reasonable in light of the changes to such rules and regulations, but any such adjustment shall
apply only to the affected television broadcast signals carried on those systems affected by the
change.
(D) The gross receipts limitations established by section 111(d)(1)(C) and (D) 1 shall be
adjusted to reflect national monetary inflation or deflation or changes in the average rates
charged cable system subscribers for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions to
maintain the real constant dollar value of the exemption provided by such section, and the
royalty rate specified therein shall not be subject to adjustment.
(3)(A) To authorize the distribution, under sections 111, 119, and 1007, of those royalty fees
collected under sections 111, 119, and 1005, as the case may be, to the extent that the Copyright
Royalty Judges have found that the distribution of such fees is not subject to controversy.
(B) In cases where the Copyright Royalty Judges determine that controversy exists, the
Copyright Royalty Judges shall determine the distribution of such fees, including partial
distributions, in accordance with section 111, 119, or 1007, as the case may be.
(C) Notwithstanding section 804(b)(8), the Copyright Royalty Judges, at any time after the
filing of claims under section 111, 119, or 1007, may, upon motion of one or more of the
claimants and after publication in the Federal Register of a request for responses to the motion
from interested claimants, make a partial distribution of such fees, if, based upon all responses
received during the 30-day period beginning on the date of such publication, the Copyright
Royalty Judges conclude that no claimant entitled to receive such fees has stated a reasonable
objection to the partial distribution, and all such claimants—
(i) agree to the partial distribution;
(ii) sign an agreement obligating them to return any excess amounts to the extent necessary to
comply with the final determination on the distribution of the fees made under subparagraph
(B);
(iii) file the agreement with the Copyright Royalty Judges; and
(iv) agree that such funds are available for distribution.
(D) The Copyright Royalty Judges and any other officer or employee acting in good faith in
distributing funds under subparagraph (C) shall not be held liable for the payment of any excess
fees under subparagraph (C). The Copyright Royalty Judges shall, at the time the final
determination is made, calculate any such excess amounts.
(4) To accept or reject royalty claims filed under sections 111, 119, and 1007, on the basis of
[Release Point 118-106]
timeliness or the failure to establish the basis for a claim.
(5) To accept or reject rate adjustment petitions as provided in section 804 and petitions to
participate as provided in section 803(b) (1) and (2).
(6) To determine the status of a digital audio recording device or a digital audio interface device
under sections 1002 and 1003, as provided in section 1010.
(7)(A) To adopt as a basis for statutory terms and rates or as a basis for the distribution of
statutory royalty payments, an agreement concerning such matters reached among some or all of
the participants in a proceeding at any time during the proceeding, except that—
(i) the Copyright Royalty Judges shall provide to those that would be bound by the terms,
rates, or other determination set by any agreement in a proceeding to determine royalty rates an
opportunity to comment on the agreement and shall provide to participants in the proceeding
under section 803(b)(2) that would be bound by the terms, rates, or other determination set by
the agreement an opportunity to comment on the agreement and object to its adoption as a basis
for statutory terms and rates; and
(ii) the Copyright Royalty Judges may decline to adopt the agreement as a basis for statutory
terms and rates for participants that are not parties to the agreement, if any participant described
in clause (i) objects to the agreement and the Copyright Royalty Judges conclude, based on the
record before them if one exists, that the agreement does not provide a reasonable basis for
setting statutory terms or rates.
(B) License agreements voluntarily negotiated pursuant to section 112(e)(5), 114(f)(2),
115(c)(3)(E)(i), 116(c), or 118(b)(2) that do not result in statutory terms and rates shall not be
subject to clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A).
(C) Interested parties may negotiate and agree to, and the Copyright Royalty Judges may adopt,
an agreement that specifies as terms notice and recordkeeping requirements that apply in lieu of
those that would otherwise apply under regulations.
(8) To determine the administrative assessment to be paid by digital music providers under
section 115(d). The provisions of section 115(d) shall apply to the conduct of proceedings by the
Copyright Royalty Judges under section 115(d) and not the procedures described in this section, or
section 803, 804, or 805.
(9) To perform other duties, as assigned by the Register of Copyrights within the Library of
Congress, except as provided in section 802(g), at times when Copyright Royalty Judges are not
engaged in performing the other duties set forth in this section.
(c) RULINGS.—The Copyright Royalty Judges may make any necessary procedural or
evidentiary rulings in any proceeding under this chapter and may, before commencing a proceeding
under this chapter, make any such rulings that would apply to the proceedings conducted by the
Copyright Royalty Judges.
(d) ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT.—The Librarian of Congress shall provide the Copyright
Royalty Judges with the necessary administrative services related to proceedings under this chapter.
(e) LOCATION IN LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.—The offices of the Copyright Royalty Judges
and staff shall be in the Library of Congress.
(f) EFFECTIVE DATE OF ACTIONS.—On and after the date of the enactment of the Copyright
Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, in any case in which time limits are prescribed under
this title for performance of an action with or by the Copyright Royalty Judges, and in which the last
day of the prescribed period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, holiday, or other nonbusiness day within
the District of Columbia or the Federal Government, the action may be taken on the next succeeding
business day, and is effective as of the date when the period expired.

(A) IN GENERAL.—(i) Subject to subparagraph (B) and clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the
Copyright Royalty Judges shall have full independence in making determinations concerning
adjustments and determinations of copyright royalty rates and terms, the distribution of
copyright royalties, the acceptance or rejection of royalty claims, rate adjustment petitions, and
petitions to participate, and in issuing other rulings under this title, except that the Copyright
Royalty Judges may consult with the Register of Copyrights on any matter other than a question
of fact.
(ii) One or more Copyright Royalty Judges may, or by motion to the Copyright Royalty
Judges, any participant in a proceeding may, request from the Register of Copyrights an
interpretation of any material questions of substantive law that relate to the construction of
[Release Point 118-106]
provisions of this title and arise in the course of the proceeding. Any request for a written
interpretation shall be in writing and on the record, and reasonable provision shall be made to
permit participants in the proceeding to comment on the material questions of substantive law in
a manner that minimizes duplication and delay. Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the
Register of Copyrights shall deliver to the Copyright Royalty Judges a written response within
14 days after the receipt of all briefs and comments from the participants. The Copyright
Royalty Judges shall apply the legal interpretation embodied in the response of the Register of
Copyrights if it is timely delivered, and the response shall be included in the record that
accompanies the final determination. The authority under this clause shall not be construed to
authorize the Register of Copyrights to provide an interpretation of questions of procedure
before the Copyright Royalty Judges, the ultimate adjustments and determinations of copyright
royalty rates and terms, the ultimate distribution of copyright royalties, or the acceptance or
rejection of royalty claims, rate adjustment petitions, or petitions to participate in a proceeding.
(B) NOVEL QUESTIONS.—(i) In any case in which a novel material question of
substantive law concerning an interpretation of those provisions of this title that are the subject
of the proceeding is presented, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall request a decision of the
Register of Copyrights, in writing, to resolve such novel question. Reasonable provision shall
be made for comment on such request by the participants in the proceeding, in such a way as to
minimize duplication and delay. The Register of Copyrights shall transmit his or her decision to
the Copyright Royalty Judges within 30 days after the Register of Copyrights receives all of the
briefs or comments of the participants. Such decision shall be in writing and included by the
Copyright Royalty Judges in the record that accompanies their final determination. If such a
decision is timely delivered to the Copyright Royalty Judges, the Copyright Royalty Judges
shall apply the legal determinations embodied in the decision of the Register of Copyrights in
resolving material questions of substantive law.

in prior decisions, determinations, and rulings described in section 803(a).
(C) CONSULTATION.—Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), the Copyright
Royalty Judges shall consult with the Register of Copyrights with respect to any determination
or ruling that would require that any act be performed by the Copyright Office, and any such
determination or ruling shall not be binding upon the Register of Copyrights.
(D) REVIEW OF LEGAL CONCLUSIONS BY THE REGISTER OF COPYRIGHTS.—The
Register of Copyrights may review for legal error the resolution by the Copyright Royalty
Judges of a material question of substantive law under this title that underlies or is contained in
a final determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges. If the Register of Copyrights concludes,
after taking into consideration the views of the participants in the proceeding, that any
resolution reached by the Copyright Royalty Judges was in material error, the Register of
Copyrights shall issue a written decision correcting such legal error, which shall be made part of
the record of the proceeding. The Register of Copyrights shall issue such written decision not
later than 60 days after the date on which the final determination by the Copyright Royalty
Judges is issued. Additionally, the Register of Copyrights shall cause to be published in the
Federal Register such written decision, together with a specific identification of the legal
conclusion of the Copyright Royalty Judges that is determined to be erroneous. As to
conclusions of substantive law involving an interpretation of the statutory provisions of this
title, the decision of the Register of Copyrights shall be binding as precedent upon the
Copyright Royalty Judges in subsequent proceedings under this chapter. When a decision has
been rendered pursuant to this subparagraph, the Register of Copyrights may, on the basis of
and in accordance with such decision, intervene as of right in any appeal of a final
determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges pursuant to section 803(d) in the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. If, prior to intervening in such an appeal,
the Register of Copyrights gives notification to, and undertakes to consult with, the Attorney
General with respect to such intervention, and the Attorney General fails, within a reasonable
period after receiving such notification, to intervene in such appeal, the Register of Copyrights
[Release Point 118-106]
may intervene in such appeal in his or her own name by any attorney designated by the Register
of Copyrights for such purpose. Intervention by the Register of Copyrights in his or her own
name shall not preclude the Attorney General from intervening on behalf of the United States in
such an appeal as may be otherwise provided or required by law.
(E) EFFECT ON JUDICIAL REVIEW.—Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to alter
the standard applied by a court in reviewing legal determinations involving an interpretation or
construction of the provisions of this title or to affect the extent to which any construction or

Congress adopts regulations under subsection (h) relating to the sanction or removal of a
Copyright Royalty Judge and such regulations require documentation to establish the cause of
such sanction or removal, the Copyright Royalty Judge may receive an appraisal related
specifically to the cause of the sanction or removal.
(g) INCONSISTENT DUTIES BARRED.—No Copyright Royalty Judge may undertake duties
that conflict with his or her duties and responsibilities as a Copyright Royalty Judge.
(h) STANDARDS OF CONDUCT.—The Librarian of Congress shall adopt regulations regarding
the standards of conduct, including financial conflict of interest and restrictions against ex parte

Copyright Royalty Judge for violation of the standards of conduct adopted under subsection (h),
misconduct, neglect of duty, or any disqualifying physical or mental disability. Any such sanction or
removal may be made only after notice and opportunity for a hearing, but the Librarian of Congress
may suspend the Copyright Royalty Judge during the pendency of such hearing. The Librarian shall
appoint an interim Copyright Royalty Judge during the period of any such suspension.

Judges under such regulations.
(C) REQUIREMENTS.—Regulations issued under subparagraph (A) shall include the
following:
(i) The written direct statements and written rebuttal statements of all participants in a
proceeding under paragraph (2) shall be filed by a date specified by the Copyright Royalty
Judges, which, in the case of written direct statements, may be not earlier than 4 months, and
not later than 5 months, after the end of the voluntary negotiation period under paragraph (3).
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Copyright Royalty Judges may allow a
participant in a proceeding to file an amended written direct statement based on new
information received during the discovery process, within 15 days after the end of the
discovery period specified in clause (iv).
(ii)(I) Following the submission to the Copyright Royalty Judges of written direct
statements and written rebuttal statements by the participants in a proceeding under
paragraph (2), the Copyright Royalty Judges, after taking into consideration the views of the
participants in the proceeding, shall determine a schedule for conducting and completing
discovery.
(II) In this chapter, the term "written direct statements" means witness statements,
testimony, and exhibits to be presented in the proceedings, and such other information that is
necessary to establish terms and rates, or the distribution of royalty payments, as the case
may be, as set forth in regulations issued by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
(iii) Hearsay may be admitted in proceedings under this chapter to the extent deemed
appropriate by the Copyright Royalty Judges.
(iv) Discovery in connection with written direct statements shall be permitted for a period
of 60 days, except for discovery ordered by the Copyright Royalty Judges in connection with
the resolution of motions, orders, and disputes pending at the end of such period. The
Copyright Royalty Judges may order a discovery schedule in connection with written rebuttal
statements.
(v) Any participant under paragraph (2) in a proceeding under this chapter to determine
royalty rates may request of an opposing participant nonprivileged documents directly related
to the written direct statement or written rebuttal statement of that participant. Any objection
to such a request shall be resolved by a motion or request to compel production made to the
Copyright Royalty Judges in accordance with regulations adopted by the Copyright Royalty
Judges. Each motion or request to compel discovery shall be determined by the Copyright
Royalty Judges, or by a Copyright Royalty Judge when permitted under subsection (a)(2).
Upon such motion, the Copyright Royalty Judges may order discovery pursuant to
regulations established under this paragraph.
(vi)(I) Any participant under paragraph (2) in a proceeding under this chapter to determine
royalty rates may, by means of written motion or on the record, request of an opposing
participant or witness other relevant information and materials if, absent the discovery
sought, the Copyright Royalty Judges' resolution of the proceeding would be substantially
impaired. In determining whether discovery will be granted under this clause, the Copyright
Royalty Judges may consider—
(aa) whether the burden or expense of producing the requested information or materials
outweighs the likely benefit, taking into account the needs and resources of the
participants, the importance of the issues at stake, and the probative value of the requested
information or materials in resolving such issues;
(bb) whether the requested information or materials would be unreasonably cumulative
or duplicative, or are obtainable from another source that is more convenient, less
burdensome, or less expensive; and
(cc) whether the participant seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery
in the proceeding or by other means to obtain the information sought.
[Release Point 118-106]
(II) This clause shall not apply to any proceeding scheduled to commence after December
31, 2010.
(vii) In a proceeding under this chapter to determine royalty rates, the participants entitled
to receive royalties shall collectively be permitted to take no more than 10 depositions and
secure responses to no more than 25 interrogatories, and the participants obligated to pay
royalties shall collectively be permitted to take no more than 10 depositions and secure
responses to no more than 25 interrogatories. The Copyright Royalty Judges shall resolve any
disputes among similarly aligned participants to allocate the number of depositions or
interrogatories permitted under this clause.
(viii) The rules and practices in effect on the day before the effective date of the Copyright
Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, relating to discovery in proceedings under this
chapter to determine the distribution of royalty fees, shall continue to apply to such
proceedings on and after such effective date.
(ix) In proceedings to determine royalty rates, the Copyright Royalty Judges may issue a
subpoena commanding a participant or witness to appear and give testimony, or to produce
and permit inspection of documents or tangible things, if the Copyright Royalty Judges'
resolution of the proceeding would be substantially impaired by the absence of such
testimony or production of documents or tangible things. Such subpoena shall specify with
reasonable particularity the materials to be produced or the scope and nature of the required
testimony. Nothing in this clause shall preclude the Copyright Royalty Judges from
requesting the production by a nonparticipant of information or materials relevant to the
resolution by the Copyright Royalty Judges of a material issue of fact.
(x) The Copyright Royalty Judges shall order a settlement conference among the
participants in the proceeding to facilitate the presentation of offers of settlement among the
participants. The settlement conference shall be held during a 21-day period following the
60-day discovery period specified in clause (iv) and shall take place outside the presence of
the Copyright Royalty Judges.
(xi) No evidence, including exhibits, may be submitted in the written direct statement or
written rebuttal statement of a participant without a sponsoring witness, except where the
Copyright Royalty Judges have taken official notice, or in the case of incorporation by
reference of past records, or for good cause shown.
(c) DETERMINATION OF COPYRIGHT ROYALTY JUDGES.—
(1) TIMING.—The Copyright Royalty Judges shall issue their determination in a proceeding
not later than 11 months after the conclusion of the 21-day settlement conference period under
subsection (b)(6)(C)(x), but, in the case of a proceeding to determine successors to rates or terms
that expire on a specified date, in no event later than 15 days before the expiration of the then
current statutory rates and terms.
(2) REHEARINGS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The Copyright Royalty Judges may, in exceptional cases, upon motion
of a participant in a proceeding under subsection (b)(2), order a rehearing, after the
determination in the proceeding is issued under paragraph (1), on such matters as the Copyright
Royalty Judges determine to be appropriate.
(B) TIMING FOR FILING MOTION.—Any motion for a rehearing under subparagraph (A)
may only be filed within 15 days after the date on which the Copyright Royalty Judges deliver
to the participants in the proceeding their initial determination.
(C) PARTICIPATION BY OPPOSING PARTY NOT REQUIRED.—In any case in which a
rehearing is ordered, any opposing party shall not be required to participate in the rehearing,
except that nonparticipation may give rise to the limitations with respect to judicial review
provided for in subsection (d)(1).
(D) NO NEGATIVE INFERENCE.—No negative inference shall be drawn from lack of
participation in a rehearing.
[Release Point 118-106]
(E) CONTINUITY OF RATES AND TERMS.—(i) If the decision of the Copyright Royalty
Judges on any motion for a rehearing is not rendered before the expiration of the statutory rates
and terms that were previously in effect, in the case of a proceeding to determine successors to
rates and terms that expire on a specified date, then—
(I) the initial determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges that is the subject of the
rehearing motion shall be effective as of the day following the date on which the rates and
terms that were previously in effect expire; and
(II) in the case of a proceeding under section 114(f)(1)(C), royalty rates and terms shall, for
purposes of section 114(f)(3)(B), be deemed to have been set at those rates and terms
contained in the initial determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges that is the subject of
the rehearing motion, as of the date of that determination.
(ii) The pendency of a motion for a rehearing under this paragraph shall not relieve persons
obligated to make royalty payments who would be affected by the determination on that motion
from providing the statements of account and any reports of use, to the extent required, and
paying the royalties required under the relevant determination or regulations.
(iii) Notwithstanding clause (ii), whenever royalties described in clause (ii) are paid to a
person other than the Copyright Office, the entity designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges
to which such royalties are paid by the copyright user (and any successor thereto) shall, within
60 days after the motion for rehearing is resolved or, if the motion is granted, within 60 days
after the rehearing is concluded, return any excess amounts previously paid to the extent
necessary to comply with the final determination of royalty rates by the Copyright Royalty
Judges. Any underpayment of royalties resulting from a rehearing shall be paid within the same
period.
(3) CONTENTS OF DETERMINATION.—A determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges
shall be supported by the written record and shall set forth the findings of fact relied on by the
Copyright Royalty Judges. Among other terms adopted in a determination, the Copyright Royalty
Judges may specify notice and recordkeeping requirements of users of the copyrights at issue that
apply in lieu of those that would otherwise apply under regulations.
(4) CONTINUING JURISDICTION.—The Copyright Royalty Judges may issue an amendment
to a written determination to correct any technical or clerical errors in the determination or to
modify the terms, but not the rates, of royalty payments in response to unforeseen circumstances
that would frustrate the proper implementation of such determination. Such amendment shall be
set forth in a written addendum to the determination that shall be distributed to the participants of
the proceeding and shall be published in the Federal Register.
(5) PROTECTIVE ORDER.—The Copyright Royalty Judges may issue such orders as may be
appropriate to protect confidential information, including orders excluding confidential
information from the record of the determination that is published or made available to the public,
except that any terms or rates of royalty payments or distributions may not be excluded.
(6) PUBLICATION OF DETERMINATION.—By no later than the end of the 60-day period
provided in section 802(f)(1)(D), the Librarian of Congress shall cause the determination, and any
corrections thereto, to be published in the Federal Register. The Librarian of Congress shall also
publicize the determination and corrections in such other manner as the Librarian considers
appropriate, including, but not limited to, publication on the Internet. The Librarian of Congress
shall also make the determination, corrections, and the accompanying record available for public
inspection and copying.
(7) LATE PAYMENT.—A determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges may include terms
with respect to late payment, but in no way shall such terms prevent the copyright holder from
asserting other rights or remedies provided under this title.
(d) JUDICIAL REVIEW.—
(1) APPEAL.—Any determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges under subsection (c) may,
[Release Point 118-106]
within 30 days after the publication of the determination in the Federal Register, be appealed, to
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, by any aggrieved
participant in the proceeding under subsection (b)(2) who fully participated in the proceeding and
who would be bound by the determination. Any participant that did not participate in a rehearing
may not raise any issue that was the subject of that rehearing at any stage of judicial review of the
hearing determination. If no appeal is brought within that 30-day period, the determination of the
Copyright Royalty Judges shall be final, and the royalty fee or determination with respect to the
distribution of fees, as the case may be, shall take effect as set forth in paragraph (2).
(2) EFFECT OF RATES.—
(A) EXPIRATION ON SPECIFIED DATE.—When this title provides that the royalty rates
and terms that were previously in effect are to expire on a specified date, any adjustment or
determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges of successor rates and terms for an ensuing
statutory license period shall be effective as of the day following the date of expiration of the
rates and terms that were previously in effect, even if the determination of the Copyright
Royalty Judges is rendered on a later date. A licensee shall be obligated to continue making
payments under the rates and terms previously in effect until such time as rates and terms for
the successor period are established. Whenever royalties pursuant to this section are paid to a
person other than the Copyright Office, the entity designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges
to which such royalties are paid by the copyright user (and any successor thereto) shall, within
60 days after the final determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges establishing rates and
terms for a successor period or the exhaustion of all rehearings or appeals of such
determination, if any, return any excess amounts previously paid to the extent necessary to
comply with the final determination of royalty rates. Any underpayment of royalties by a
copyright user shall be paid to the entity designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges within the
same period.
(B) OTHER CASES.—In cases where rates and terms have not, prior to the inception of an
activity, been established for that particular activity under the relevant license, such rates and
terms shall be retroactive to the inception of activity under the relevant license covered by such
rates and terms. In other cases where rates and terms do not expire on a specified date,
successor rates and terms shall take effect on the first day of the second month that begins after
the publication of the determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges in the Federal Register,
except as otherwise provided in this title, or by the Copyright Royalty Judges, or as agreed by
the participants in a proceeding that would be bound by the rates and terms. Except as otherwise
provided in this title, the rates and terms, to the extent applicable, shall remain in effect until
such successor rates and terms become effective.
(C) OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS.—
(i) The pendency of an appeal under this subsection shall not relieve persons obligated to
make royalty payments under section 111, 112, 114, 115, 116, 118, 119, or 1003, who would
be affected by the determination on appeal, from—
(I) providing the applicable statements of account and reports of use; and
(II) paying the royalties required under the relevant determination or regulations.
(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), whenever royalties described in clause (i) are paid to a
person other than the Copyright Office, the entity designated by the Copyright Royalty
Judges to which such royalties are paid by the copyright user (and any successor thereto)
shall, within 60 days after the final resolution of the appeal, return any excess amounts
previously paid (and interest thereon, if ordered pursuant to paragraph (3)) to the extent
necessary to comply with the final determination of royalty rates on appeal. Any
underpayment of royalties resulting from an appeal (and interest thereon, if ordered pursuant
to paragraph (3)) shall be paid within the same period.
(3) JURISDICTION OF COURT.—Section 706 of title 5 shall apply with respect to review by
the court of appeals under this subsection. If the court modifies or vacates a determination of the
[Release Point 118-106]
Copyright Royalty Judges, the court may enter its own determination with respect to the amount
or distribution of royalty fees and costs, and order the repayment of any excess fees, the payment
of any underpaid fees, and the payment of interest pertaining respectively thereto, in accordance
with its final judgment. The court may also vacate the determination of the Copyright Royalty
Judges and remand the case to the Copyright Royalty Judges for further proceedings in accordance
with subsection (a).
(e) ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS.—
(1) DEDUCTION OF COSTS OF LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND COPYRIGHT OFFICE
FROM FILING FEES.—
(A) DEDUCTION FROM FILING FEES.—The Librarian of Congress may, to the extent not
otherwise provided under this title, deduct from the filing fees collected under subsection (b) for
a particular proceeding under this chapter the reasonable costs incurred by the Librarian of
Congress, the Copyright Office, and the Copyright Royalty Judges in conducting that
proceeding, other than the salaries of the Copyright Royalty Judges and the staff members
appointed under section 802(b).
(B) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be appropriated
such sums as may be necessary to pay the costs incurred under this chapter not covered by the
filing fees collected under subsection (b). All funds made available pursuant to this
subparagraph shall remain available until expended.
(2) POSITIONS REQUIRED FOR ADMINISTRATION OF COMPULSORY LICENSING
.—Section 307 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1994, shall not apply to employee
positions in the Library of Congress that are required to be filled in order to carry out section 111,
112, 114, 115, 116, 118, or 119 or chapter 10.

§901. Definitions
(a) As used in this chapter—
(1) a "semiconductor chip product" is the final or intermediate form of any product—
(A) having two or more layers of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material, deposited or
otherwise placed on, or etched away or otherwise removed from, a piece of semiconductor
material in accordance with a predetermined pattern; and
(B) intended to perform electronic circuitry functions;
(2) a "mask work" is a series of related images, however fixed or encoded—
(A) having or representing the predetermined, three-dimensional pattern of metallic,
insulating, or semiconductor material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor
chip product; and
(B) in which series the relation of the images to one another is that each image has the pattern
of the surface of one form of the semiconductor chip product;
(3) a mask work is "fixed" in a semiconductor chip product when its embodiment in the product
is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit the mask work to be perceived or reproduced from the
product for a period of more than transitory duration;
(4) to "distribute" means to sell, or to lease, bail, or otherwise transfer, or to offer to sell, lease,
bail, or otherwise transfer;
(5) to "commercially exploit" a mask work is to distribute to the public for commercial purposes
a semiconductor chip product embodying the mask work; except that such term includes an offer
to sell or transfer a semiconductor chip product only when the offer is in writing and occurs after
the mask work is fixed in the semiconductor chip product;
(6) the "owner" of a mask work is the person who created the mask work, the legal
representative of that person if that person is deceased or under a legal incapacity, or a party to
whom all the rights under this chapter of such person or representative are transferred in
accordance with section 903(b); except that, in the case of a work made within the scope of a
person's employment, the owner is the employer for whom the person created the mask work or a
party to whom all the rights under this chapter of the employer are transferred in accordance with
section 903(b);
(7) an "innocent purchaser" is a person who purchases a semiconductor chip product in good
[Release Point 118-106]
faith and without having notice of protection with respect to the semiconductor chip product;
(8) having "notice of protection" means having actual knowledge that, or reasonable grounds to
believe that, a mask work is protected under this chapter; and
(9) an "infringing semiconductor chip product" is a semiconductor chip product which is made,
imported, or distributed in violation of the exclusive rights of the owner of a mask work under this
chapter.
(b) For purposes of this chapter, the distribution or importation of a product incorporating a
semiconductor chip product as a part thereof is a distribution or importation of that semiconductor
chip product.

exploited anywhere in the world, whichever occurs first, the owner of the mask work is (i) a
national or domiciliary of the United States, (ii) a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of a
foreign nation that is a party to a treaty affording protection to mask works to which the United
States is also a party, or (iii) a stateless person, wherever that person may be domiciled;
(B) the mask work is first commercially exploited in the United States; or
(C) the mask work comes within the scope of a Presidential proclamation issued under
paragraph (2).
(2) Whenever the President finds that a foreign nation extends, to mask works of owners who are
nationals or domiciliaries of the United States protection (A) on substantially the same basis as that
on which the foreign nation extends protection to mask works of its own nationals and domiciliaries
and mask works first commercially exploited in that nation, or (B) on substantially the same basis as
provided in this chapter, the President may by proclamation extend protection under this chapter to
mask works (i) of owners who are, on the date on which the mask works are registered under section
908, or the date on which the mask works are first commercially exploited anywhere in the world,
whichever occurs first, nationals, domiciliaries, or sovereign authorities of that nation, or (ii) which
are first commercially exploited in that nation. The President may revise, suspend, or revoke any
such proclamation or impose any conditions or limitations on protection extended under any such
proclamation.
(b) Protection under this chapter shall not be available for a mask work that—
(1) is not original; or
(2) consists of designs that are staple, commonplace, or familiar in the semiconductor industry,
or variations of such designs, combined in a way that, considered as a whole, is not original.
(c) In no case does protection under this chapter for a mask work extend to any idea, procedure,
process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in
which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.

§903. Ownership, transfer, licensing, and recordation
(a) The exclusive rights in a mask work subject to protection under this chapter belong to the
owner of the mask work.
(b) The owner of the exclusive rights in a mask work may transfer all of those rights, or license all
or less than all of those rights, by any written instrument signed by such owner or a duly authorized
agent of the owner. Such rights may be transferred or licensed by operation of law, may be
bequeathed by will, and may pass as personal property by the applicable laws of intestate succession.
(c)(1) Any document pertaining to a mask work may be recorded in the Copyright Office if the
document filed for recordation bears the actual signature of the person who executed it, or if it is

document. The Register of Copyrights shall, upon receipt of the document and the fee specified
pursuant to section 908(d), record the document and return it with a certificate of recordation. The
recordation of any transfer or license under this paragraph gives all persons constructive notice of the
facts stated in the recorded document concerning the transfer or license.
(2) In any case in which conflicting transfers of the exclusive rights in a mask work are made, the
transfer first executed shall be void as against a subsequent transfer which is made for a valuable
consideration and without notice of the first transfer, unless the first transfer is recorded in
accordance with paragraph (1) within three months after the date on which it is executed, but in no
case later than the day before the date of such subsequent transfer.
(d) Mask works prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of
that person's official duties are not protected under this chapter, but the United States Government is
not precluded from receiving and holding exclusive rights in mask works transferred to the
Government under subsection (b).
(Added Pub. L. 98–620, title III, §302, Nov. 8, 1984, 98 Stat. 3349.)

(Added Pub. L. 98–620, title III, §302, Nov. 8, 1984, 98 Stat. 3350.)
§908. Registration of claims of protection
(a) The owner of a mask work may apply to the Register of Copyrights for registration of a claim
of protection in a mask work. Protection of a mask work under this chapter shall terminate if
application for registration of a claim of protection in the mask work is not made as provided in this
chapter within two years after the date on which the mask work is first commercially exploited
anywhere in the world.
(b) The Register of Copyrights shall be responsible for all administrative functions and duties
under this chapter. Except for section 708, the provisions of chapter 7 of this title relating to the
general responsibilities, organization, regulatory authority, actions, records, and publications of the
Copyright Office shall apply to this chapter, except that the Register of Copyrights may make such
changes as may be necessary in applying those provisions to this chapter.
(c) The application for registration of a mask work shall be made on a form prescribed by the
Register of Copyrights. Such form may require any information regarded by the Register as bearing
upon the preparation or identification of the mask work, the existence or duration of protection of the
mask work under this chapter, or ownership of the mask work. The application shall be accompanied
by the fee set pursuant to subsection (d) and the identifying material specified pursuant to such
subsection.
(d) The Register of Copyrights shall by regulation set reasonable fees for the filing of applications
to register claims of protection in mask works under this chapter, and for other services relating to
the administration of this chapter or the rights under this chapter, taking into consideration the cost of
providing those services, the benefits of a public record, and statutory fee schedules under this title.
The Register shall also specify the identifying material to be deposited in connection with the claim
for registration.
(e) If the Register of Copyrights, after examining an application for registration, determines, in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, that the application relates to a mask work which is
entitled to protection under this chapter, then the Register shall register the claim of protection and
issue to the applicant a certificate of registration of the claim of protection under the seal of the
Copyright Office. The effective date of registration of a claim of protection shall be the date on
which an application, deposit of identifying material, and fee, which are determined by the Register
of Copyrights or by a court of competent jurisdiction to be acceptable for registration of the claim,
have all been received in the Copyright Office.
(f) In any action for infringement under this chapter, the certificate of registration of a mask work
shall constitute prima facie evidence (1) of the facts stated in the certificate, and (2) that the applicant
issued the certificate has met the requirements of this chapter, and the regulations issued under this
chapter, with respect to the registration of claims.
(g) Any applicant for registration under this section who is dissatisfied with the refusal of the
Register of Copyrights to issue a certificate of registration under this section may seek judicial
review of that refusal by bringing an action for such review in an appropriate United States district
court not later than sixty days after the refusal. The provisions of chapter 7 of title 5 shall apply to
such judicial review. The failure of the Register of Copyrights to issue a certificate of registration
within four months after an application for registration is filed shall be deemed to be a refusal to
[Release Point 118-106]
issue a certificate of registration for purposes of this subsection and section 910(b)(2), except that,
upon a showing of good cause, the district court may shorten such four-month period.
(Added Pub. L. 98–620, title III, §302, Nov. 8, 1984, 98 Stat. 3351.)
§909. Mask work notice
(a) The owner of a mask work provided protection under this chapter may affix notice to the mask
work, and to masks and semiconductor chip products embodying the mask work, in such manner and
location as to give reasonable notice of such protection. The Register of Copyrights shall prescribe
by regulation, as examples, specific methods of affixation and positions of notice for purposes of this
section, but these specifications shall not be considered exhaustive. The affixation of such notice is
not a condition of protection under this chapter, but shall constitute prima facie evidence of notice of
protection.
(b) The notice referred to in subsection (a) shall consist of—
(1) the words "mask work", the symbol *M*, or the symbol (M) (the letter M in a circle); and
(2) the name of the owner or owners of the mask work or an abbreviation by which the name is
recognized or is generally known.
(Added Pub. L. 98–620, title III, §302, Nov. 8, 1984, 98 Stat. 3352; amended Pub. L. 105–80,
§12(a)(22), Nov. 13, 1997, 111 Stat. 1535.)

AMENDMENTS
1997—Subsec. (b)(1). Pub. L. 105–80 substituted " 'mask work', the symbol" for " 'mask force', the
sumbol".
§910. Enforcement of exclusive rights
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any person who violates any of the exclusive
rights of the owner of a mask work under this chapter, by conduct in or affecting commerce, shall be
liable as an infringer of such rights. As used in this subsection, the term "any person" includes any
State, any instrumentality of a State, and any officer or employee of a State or instrumentality of a
State acting in his or her official capacity. Any State, and any such instrumentality, officer, or
employee, shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter in the same manner and to the same
extent as any nongovernmental entity.
(b)(1) The owner of a mask work protected under this chapter, or the exclusive licensee of all
rights under this chapter with respect to the mask work, shall, after a certificate of registration of a
claim of protection in that mask work has been issued under section 908, be entitled to institute a
civil action for any infringement with respect to the mask work which is committed after the
commencement of protection of the mask work under section 904(a).
(2) In any case in which an application for registration of a claim of protection in a mask work and
the required deposit of identifying material and fee have been received in the Copyright Office in
proper form and registration of the mask work has been refused, the applicant is entitled to institute a
civil action for infringement under this chapter with respect to the mask work if notice of the action,
together with a copy of the complaint, is served on the Register of Copyrights, in accordance with
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Register may, at his or her option, become a party to the
action with respect to the issue of whether the claim of protection is eligible for registration by
entering an appearance within sixty days after such service, but the failure of the Register to become
a party to the action shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine that issue.
(c)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Postal Service shall separately or jointly
issue regulations for the enforcement of the rights set forth in section 905 with respect to
importation. These regulations may require, as a condition for the exclusion of articles from the
[Release Point 118-106]
United States, that the person seeking exclusion take any one or more of the following actions:
(A) Obtain a court order enjoining, or an order of the International Trade Commission under
section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 excluding, importation of the articles.
(B) Furnish proof that the mask work involved is protected under this chapter and that the
importation of the articles would infringe the rights in the mask work under this chapter.
(C) Post a surety bond for any injury that may result if the detention or exclusion of the articles
proves to be unjustified.
(2) Articles imported in violation of the rights set forth in section 905 are subject to seizure and
forfeiture in the same manner as property imported in violation of the customs laws. Any such
forfeited articles shall be destroyed as directed by the Secretary of the Treasury or the court, as the
case may be, except that the articles may be returned to the country of export whenever it is shown to
the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that the importer had no reasonable grounds for
believing that his or her acts constituted a violation of the law.

§911. Civil actions
(a) Any court having jurisdiction of a civil action arising under this chapter may grant temporary
restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, and permanent injunctions on such terms as the court
may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of the exclusive rights in a mask work
under this chapter.
(b) Upon finding an infringer liable, to a person entitled under section 910(b)(1) to institute a civil
action, for an infringement of any exclusive right under this chapter, the court shall award such
person actual damages suffered by the person as a result of the infringement. The court shall also
award such person the infringer's profits that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken
into account in computing the award of actual damages. In establishing the infringer's profits, such
person is required to present proof only of the infringer's gross revenue, and the infringer is required
to prove his or her deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than
the mask work.
(c) At any time before final judgment is rendered, a person entitled to institute a civil action for
infringement may elect, instead of actual damages and profits as provided by subsection (b), an
[Release Point 118-106]
award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action, with respect to any one mask
work for which any one infringer is liable individually, or for which any two or more infringers are
liable jointly and severally, in an amount not more than $250,000 as the court considers just.
(d) An action for infringement under this chapter shall be barred unless the action is commenced
within three years after the claim accrues.
(e)(1) At any time while an action for infringement of the exclusive rights in a mask work under
this chapter is pending, the court may order the impounding, on such terms as it may deem
reasonable, of all semiconductor chip products, and any drawings, tapes, masks, or other products by
means of which such products may be reproduced, that are claimed to have been made, imported, or
used in violation of those exclusive rights. Insofar as practicable, applications for orders under this
paragraph shall be heard and determined in the same manner as an application for a temporary
restraining order or preliminary injunction.
(2) As part of a final judgment or decree, the court may order the destruction or other disposition
of any infringing semiconductor chip products, and any masks, tapes, or other articles by means of
which such products may be reproduced.
(f) In any civil action arising under this chapter, the court in its discretion may allow the recovery
of full costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, to the prevailing party.
(g)(1) Any State, any instrumentality of a State, and any officer or employee of a State or
instrumentality of a State acting in his or her official capacity, shall not be immune, under the
Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States or under any other doctrine of
sovereign immunity, from suit in Federal court by any person, including any governmental or
nongovernmental entity, for a violation of any of the exclusive rights of the owner of a mask work
under this chapter, or for any other violation under this chapter.
(2) In a suit described in paragraph (1) for a violation described in that paragraph, remedies
(including remedies both at law and in equity) are available for the violation to the same extent as
such remedies are available for such a violation in a suit against any public or private entity other
than a State, instrumentality of a State, or officer or employee of a State acting in his or her official
capacity. Such remedies include actual damages and profits under subsection (b), statutory damages
under subsection (c), impounding and disposition of infringing articles under subsection (e), and
costs and attorney's fees under subsection (f).

reasonable royalty referred to in section 907(a)(2) to the mask work owner, on all such units
imported or distributed, or both, after the date of the enactment of this chapter.
(3) In the event that a person imports or distributes infringing semiconductor chip product units
described in paragraph (2) of this subsection without first paying or offering to pay the reasonable

§914. International transitional provisions
[Release Point 118-106]
(a) Notwithstanding the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 902(a)(1)
with respect to the availability of protection under this chapter to nationals, domiciliaries, and
sovereign authorities of a foreign nation, the Secretary of Commerce may, upon the petition of any
person, or upon the Secretary's own motion, issue an order extending protection under this chapter to
such foreign nationals, domiciliaries, and sovereign authorities if the Secretary finds—
(1) that the foreign nation is making good faith efforts and reasonable progress toward—
(A) entering into a treaty described in section 902(a)(1)(A); or
(B) enacting or implementing legislation that would be in compliance with subparagraph (A)
or (B) of section 902(a)(2); and
(2) that the nationals, domiciliaries, and sovereign authorities of the foreign nation, and persons
controlled by them, are not engaged in the misappropriation, or unauthorized distribution or
commercial exploitation, of mask works; and
(3) that issuing the order would promote the purposes of this chapter and international comity
with respect to the protection of mask works.
(b) While an order under subsection (a) is in effect with respect to a foreign nation, no application
for registration of a claim for protection in a mask work under this chapter may be denied solely
because the owner of the mask work is a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of that foreign
nation, or solely because the mask work was first commercially exploited in that foreign nation.
(c) Any order issued by the Secretary of Commerce under subsection (a) shall be effective for
such period as the Secretary designates in the order, except that no such order may be effective after
the date on which the authority of the Secretary of Commerce terminates under subsection (e). The
effective date of any such order shall also be designated in the order. In the case of an order issued
upon the petition of a person, such effective date may be no earlier than the date on which the
Secretary receives such petition.
(d)(1) Any order issued under this section shall terminate if—
(A) the Secretary of Commerce finds that any of the conditions set forth in paragraphs (1), (2),
and (3) of subsection (a) no longer exist; or
(B) mask works of nationals, domiciliaries, and sovereign authorities of that foreign nation or
mask works first commercially exploited in that foreign nation become eligible for protection
under subparagraph (A) or (C) of section 902(a)(1).
(2) Upon the termination or expiration of an order issued under this section, registrations of claims
of protection in mask works made pursuant to that order shall remain valid for the period specified in
section 904.
(e) The authority of the Secretary of Commerce under this section shall commence on the date of
the enactment of this chapter, and shall terminate on July 1, 1995.
(f)(1) The Secretary of Commerce shall promptly notify the Register of Copyrights and the
Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the issuance or
termination of any order under this section, together with a statement of the reasons for such action.
The Secretary shall also publish such notification and statement of reasons in the Federal Register.
(2) Two years after the date of the enactment of this chapter, the Secretary of Commerce, in
consultation with the Register of Copyrights, shall transmit to the Committees on the Judiciary of the
Senate and the House of Representatives a report on the actions taken under this section and on the
current status of international recognition of mask work protection. The report shall include such
recommendations for modifications of the protection accorded under this chapter to mask works
owned by nationals, domiciliaries, or sovereign authorities of foreign nations as the Secretary, in
consultation with the Register of Copyrights, considers would promote the purposes of this chapter
and international comity with respect to mask work protection. Not later than July 1, 1994, the
Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Register of Copyrights, shall transmit to the
Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report updating the
matters contained in the report transmitted under the preceding sentence.

(a) DIGITAL AUDIO RECORDING DEVICES.—
(1) AMOUNT OF PAYMENT.—The royalty payment due under section 1003 for each digital
audio recording device imported into and distributed in the United States, or manufactured and
distributed in the United States, shall be 2 percent of the transfer price. Only the first person to
manufacture and distribute or import and distribute such device shall be required to pay the royalty
with respect to such device.
(2) CALCULATION FOR DEVICES DISTRIBUTED WITH OTHER DEVICES.—With
respect to a digital audio recording device first distributed in combination with one or more
devices, either as a physically integrated unit or as separate components, the royalty payment shall
be calculated as follows:
(A) If the digital audio recording device and such other devices are part of a physically
integrated unit, the royalty payment shall be based on the transfer price of the unit, but shall be
reduced by any royalty payment made on any digital audio recording device included within the
unit that was not first distributed in combination with the unit.
(B) If the digital audio recording device is not part of a physically integrated unit and
substantially similar devices have been distributed separately at any time during the preceding 4
calendar quarters, the royalty payment shall be based on the average transfer price of such
devices during those 4 quarters.
(C) If the digital audio recording device is not part of a physically integrated unit and
substantially similar devices have not been distributed separately at any time during the
preceding 4 calendar quarters, the royalty payment shall be based on a constructed price
reflecting the proportional value of such device to the combination as a whole.
(3) LIMITS ON ROYALTIES.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or (2), the amount of the
royalty payment for each digital audio recording device shall not be less than $1 nor more than the
royalty maximum. The royalty maximum shall be $8 per device, except that in the case of a
physically integrated unit containing more than 1 digital audio recording device, the royalty
maximum for such unit shall be $12. During the 6th year after the effective date of this chapter,
and not more than once each year thereafter, any interested copyright party may petition the
Copyright Royalty Judges to increase the royalty maximum and, if more than 20 percent of the
royalty payments are at the relevant royalty maximum, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall
prospectively increase such royalty maximum with the goal of having no more than 10 percent of
such payments at the new royalty maximum; however the amount of any such increase as a
percentage of the royalty maximum shall in no event exceed the percentage increase in the
Consumer Price Index during the period under review.
(b) DIGITAL AUDIO RECORDING MEDIA.—The royalty payment due under section 1003 for
each digital audio recording medium imported into and distributed in the United States, or

work protected under this title. The prohibition contained in the preceding sentence shall take effect
at the end of the 2-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this chapter.
(B) The prohibition contained in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to persons who are users of a
copyrighted work which is in a particular class of works, if such persons are, or are likely to be in the
succeeding 3-year period, adversely affected by virtue of such prohibition in their ability to make
noninfringing uses of that particular class of works under this title, as determined under
subparagraph (C).
(C) During the 2-year period described in subparagraph (A), and during each succeeding 3-year
period, the Librarian of Congress, upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, who shall
consult with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of
Commerce and report and comment on his or her views in making such recommendation, shall make
the determination in a rulemaking proceeding for purposes of subparagraph (B) of whether persons
who are users of a copyrighted work are, or are likely to be in the succeeding 3-year period,
adversely affected by the prohibition under subparagraph (A) in their ability to make noninfringing
uses under this title of a particular class of copyrighted works. In conducting such rulemaking, the
Librarian shall examine—
(i) the availability for use of copyrighted works;
(ii) the availability for use of works for nonprofit archival, preservation, and educational
purposes;
(iii) the impact that the prohibition on the circumvention of technological measures applied to
copyrighted works has on criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research;
(iv) the effect of circumvention of technological measures on the market for or value of
[Release Point 118-106]
copyrighted works; and
(v) such other factors as the Librarian considers appropriate.
(D) The Librarian shall publish any class of copyrighted works for which the Librarian has
determined, pursuant to the rulemaking conducted under subparagraph (C), that noninfringing uses
by persons who are users of a copyrighted work are, or are likely to be, adversely affected, and the
prohibition contained in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to such users with respect to such class of
works for the ensuing 3-year period.
(E) Neither the exception under subparagraph (B) from the applicability of the prohibition
contained in subparagraph (A), nor any determination made in a rulemaking conducted under
subparagraph (C), may be used as a defense in any action to enforce any provision of this title other
than this paragraph.

whether the matrix or form has an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not only to portray the
[Release Point 118-106]
appearance of the product or to convey information.

and cockpit surfaces, and exclusive of masts, sails, yards, rigging, hardware, fixtures, and other
attachments.

substantial revision, adaptation, or rearrangement of such subject matter. Such protection shall be
independent of any subsisting protection in subject matter employed in the design, and shall not be
construed as securing any right to subject matter excluded from protection under this chapter or as
extending any subsisting protection under this chapter.
(Added Pub. L. 105–304, title V, §502, Oct. 28, 1998, 112 Stat. 2906.)

number of different articles in which the design may have been used during the term of its
protection.
(Added Pub. L. 105–304, title V, §502, Oct. 28, 1998, 112 Stat. 2907.)
§1306. Design notice
(a) CONTENTS OF DESIGN NOTICE.—(1) Whenever any design for which protection is sought
under this chapter is made public under section 1310(b), the owner of the design shall, subject to the
provisions of section 1307, mark it or have it marked legibly with a design notice consisting of—
(A) the words "Protected Design", the abbreviation "Prot'd Des.", or the letter "D" with a circle,
or the symbol "*D*";
(B) the year of the date on which protection for the design commenced; and
(C) the name of the owner, an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally
accepted alternative designation of the owner.
Any distinctive identification of the owner may be used for purposes of subparagraph (C) if it has
been recorded by the Administrator before the design marked with such identification is registered.
(2) After registration, the registration number may be used instead of the elements specified in
subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1).
(b) LOCATION OF NOTICE.—The design notice shall be so located and applied as to give
reasonable notice of design protection while the useful article embodying the design is passing
through its normal channels of commerce.
(c) SUBSEQUENT REMOVAL OF NOTICE.—When the owner of a design has complied with
the provisions of this section, protection under this chapter shall not be affected by the removal,
destruction, or obliteration by others of the design notice on an article.
(Added Pub. L. 105–304, title V, §502, Oct. 28, 1998, 112 Stat. 2907.)
§1307. Effect of omission of notice
(a) ACTIONS WITH NOTICE.—Except as provided in subsection (b), the omission of the notice
prescribed in section 1306 shall not cause loss of the protection under this chapter or prevent
recovery for infringement under this chapter against any person who, after receiving written notice of
the design protection, begins an undertaking leading to infringement under this chapter.
(b) ACTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE.—The omission of the notice prescribed in section 1306 shall
prevent any recovery under section 1323 against a person who began an undertaking leading to
infringement under this chapter before receiving written notice of the design protection. No
injunction shall be issued under this chapter with respect to such undertaking unless the owner of the
design reimburses that person for any reasonable expenditure or contractual obligation in connection
with such undertaking that was incurred before receiving written notice of the design protection, as
the court in its discretion directs. The burden of providing written notice of design protection shall be
on the owner of the design.
(Added Pub. L. 105–304, title V, §502, Oct. 28, 1998, 112 Stat. 2907.)
§1308. Exclusive rights

[Release Point 118-106]
§1309. Infringement
(a) ACTS OF INFRINGEMENT.—Except as provided in subsection (b), it shall be infringement
of the exclusive rights in a design protected under this chapter for any person, without the consent of
the owner of the design, within the United States and during the term of such protection, to—
(1) make, have made, or import, for sale or for use in trade, any infringing article as defined in
subsection (e); or
(2) sell or distribute for sale or for use in trade any such infringing article.
(b) ACTS OF SELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS.—A seller or distributor of an infringing article
who did not make or import the article shall be deemed to have infringed on a design protected under
this chapter only if that person—
(1) induced or acted in collusion with a manufacturer to make, or an importer to import such
article, except that merely purchasing or giving an order to purchase such article in the ordinary
course of business shall not of itself constitute such inducement or collusion; or
(2) refused or failed, upon the request of the owner of the design, to make a prompt and full
disclosure of that person's source of such article, and that person orders or reorders such article
after receiving notice by registered or certified mail of the protection subsisting in the design.
(c) ACTS WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE.—It shall not be infringement under this section to make,
have made, import, sell, or distribute, any article embodying a design which was created without
knowledge that a design was protected under this chapter and was copied from such protected
design.
(d) ACTS IN ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.—A person who incorporates into that
person's product of manufacture an infringing article acquired from others in the ordinary course of
business, or who, without knowledge of the protected design embodied in an infringing article,
makes or processes the infringing article for the account of another person in the ordinary course of
business, shall not be deemed to have infringed the rights in that design under this chapter except
under a condition contained in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b). Accepting an order or reorder
from the source of the infringing article shall be deemed ordering or reordering within the meaning
of subsection (b)(2).
(e) INFRINGING ARTICLE DEFINED.—As used in this section, an "infringing article" is any
article the design of which has been copied from a design protected under this chapter, without the
consent of the owner of the protected design. An infringing article is not an illustration or picture of a
protected design in an advertisement, book, periodical, newspaper, photograph, broadcast, motion
picture, or similar medium. A design shall not be deemed to have been copied from a protected
design if it is original and not substantially similar in appearance to a protected design.
(f) ESTABLISHING ORIGINALITY.—The party to any action or proceeding under this chapter
who alleges rights under this chapter in a design shall have the burden of establishing the design's
originality whenever the opposing party introduces an earlier work which is identical to such design,
or so similar as to make prima facie showing that such design was copied from such work.
(g) REPRODUCTION FOR TEACHING OR ANALYSIS.—It is not an infringement of the
exclusive rights of a design owner for a person to reproduce the design in a useful article or in any
other form solely for the purpose of teaching, analyzing, or evaluating the appearance, concepts, or
techniques embodied in the design, or the function of the useful article embodying the design.

shall be lost if application for registration of the design is not made within 2 years after the date on
which the design is first made public.
[Release Point 118-106]

article embodying the design is anywhere publicly exhibited, publicly distributed, or offered for sale
or sold to the public by the owner of the design or with the owner's consent.

of the application;
(5) affirmation that the design has been fixed in a useful article; and
(6) such other information as may be required by the Administrator.
The application for registration may include a description setting forth the salient features of the
design, but the absence of such a description shall not prevent registration under this chapter.
(e) SWORN STATEMENT.—The application for registration shall be accompanied by a
statement under oath by the applicant or the applicant's duly authorized agent or representative,
setting forth, to the best of the applicant's knowledge and belief—
(1) that the design is original and was created by the designer or designers named in the
application;
(2) that the design has not previously been registered on behalf of the applicant or the
applicant's predecessor in title; and
(3) that the applicant is the person entitled to protection and to registration under this chapter.
If the design has been made public with the design notice prescribed in section 1306, the statement
shall also describe the exact form and position of the design notice.
(f) EFFECT OF ERRORS.—(1) Error in any statement or assertion as to the utility of the useful
article named in the application under this section, the design of which is sought to be registered,
shall not affect the protection secured under this chapter.
(2) Errors in omitting a joint designer or in naming an alleged joint designer shall not affect the
validity of the registration, or the actual ownership or the protection of the design, unless it is shown
that the error occurred with deceptive intent.
(g) DESIGN MADE IN SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT.—In a case in which the design was made
within the regular scope of the designer's employment and individual authorship of the design is
difficult or impossible to ascribe and the application so states, the name and address of the employer
for whom the design was made may be stated instead of that of the individual designer.
(h) PICTORIAL REPRESENTATION OF DESIGN.—The application for registration shall be
accompanied by two copies of a drawing or other pictorial representation of the useful article
embodying the design, having one or more views, adequate to show the design, in a form and style
suitable for reproduction, which shall be deemed a part of the application.
(i) DESIGN IN MORE THAN ONE USEFUL ARTICLE.—If the distinguishing elements of a
design are in substantially the same form in different useful articles, the design shall be protected as
to all such useful articles when protected as to one of them, but not more than one registration shall
be required for the design.
(j) APPLICATION FOR MORE THAN ONE DESIGN.—More than one design may be included
in the same application under such conditions as may be prescribed by the Administrator. For each
design included in an application the fee prescribed for a single design shall be paid.

whose legal representative or predecessor or successor in title has, previously filed an application for
registration of the same design in a foreign country which extends to designs of owners who are
citizens of the United States, or to applications filed under this chapter, similar protection to that
provided under this chapter shall have that same effect as if filed in the United States on the date on
which the application was first filed in such foreign country, if the application in the United States is
filed within 6 months after the earliest date on which any such foreign application was filed.
(Added Pub. L. 105–304, title V, §502, Oct. 28, 1998, 112 Stat. 2910.)

(a) DETERMINATION OF REGISTRABILITY OF DESIGN; REGISTRATION.—Upon the
filing of an application for registration in proper form under section 1310, and upon payment of the
fee prescribed under section 1316, the Administrator shall determine whether or not the application
relates to a design which on its face appears to be subject to protection under this chapter, and, if so,
the Register shall register the design. Registration under this subsection shall be announced by
publication. The date of registration shall be the date of publication.
(b) REFUSAL TO REGISTER; RECONSIDERATION.—If, in the judgment of the
Administrator, the application for registration relates to a design which on its face is not subject to
protection under this chapter, the Administrator shall send to the applicant a notice of refusal to
register and the grounds for the refusal. Within 3 months after the date on which the notice of refusal
is sent, the applicant may, by written request, seek reconsideration of the application. After
consideration of such a request, the Administrator shall either register the design or send to the
applicant a notice of final refusal to register.
(c) APPLICATION TO CANCEL REGISTRATION.—Any person who believes he or she is or
will be damaged by a registration under this chapter may, upon payment of the prescribed fee, apply
to the Administrator at any time to cancel the registration on the ground that the design is not subject
to protection under this chapter, stating the reasons for the request. Upon receipt of an application for
cancellation, the Administrator shall send to the owner of the design, as shown in the records of the
[Release Point 118-106]
Office of the Administrator, a notice of the application, and the owner shall have a period of 3
months after the date on which such notice is mailed in which to present arguments to the
Administrator for support of the validity of the registration. The Administrator shall also have the
authority to establish, by regulation, conditions under which the opposing parties may appear and be
heard in support of their arguments. If, after the periods provided for the presentation of arguments
have expired, the Administrator determines that the applicant for cancellation has established that the
design is not subject to protection under this chapter, the Administrator shall order the registration
stricken from the record. Cancellation under this subsection shall be announced by publication, and
notice of the Administrator's final determination with respect to any application for cancellation shall

(a) IN GENERAL.—The owner of a design is entitled, after issuance of a certificate of registration
of the design under this chapter, to institute an action for any infringement of the design.
(b) REVIEW OF REFUSAL TO REGISTER.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the owner of a
design may seek judicial review of a final refusal of the Administrator to register the design under
this chapter by bringing a civil action, and may in the same action, if the court adjudges the design
subject to protection under this chapter, enforce the rights in that design under this chapter.
(2) The owner of a design may seek judicial review under this section if—
(A) the owner has previously duly filed and prosecuted to final refusal an application in proper
form for registration of the design;
(B) the owner causes a copy of the complaint in the action to be delivered to the Administrator
within 10 days after the commencement of the action; and
(C) the defendant has committed acts in respect to the design which would constitute
infringement with respect to a design protected under this chapter.
(c) ADMINISTRATOR AS PARTY TO ACTION.—The Administrator may, at the
Administrator's option, become a party to the action with respect to the issue of registrability of the
design claim by entering an appearance within 60 days after being served with the complaint, but the
failure of the Administrator to become a party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine
that issue.
(d) USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTE.—The parties to an infringement dispute
under this chapter, within such time as may be specified by the Administrator by regulation, may
determine the dispute, or any aspect of the dispute, by arbitration. Arbitration shall be governed by
title 9. The parties shall give notice of any arbitration award to the Administrator, and such award
shall, as between the parties to the arbitration, be dispositive of the issues to which it relates. The
arbitration award shall be unenforceable until such notice is given. Nothing in this subsection shall
preclude the Administrator from determining whether a design is subject to registration in a
cancellation proceeding under section 1313(c).

addition, the court may increase the damages to such amount, not exceeding $50,000 or $1 per copy,

compensation and not a penalty. The court may receive expert testimony as an aid to the
determination of damages.
(b) INFRINGER'S PROFITS.—As an alternative to the remedies provided in subsection (a), the
court may award the claimant the infringer's profits resulting from the sale of the copies if the court
finds that the infringer's sales are reasonably related to the use of the claimant's design. In such a
case, the claimant shall be required to prove only the amount of the infringer's sales and the infringer
shall be required to prove its expenses against such sales.
(c) STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.—No recovery under subsection (a) or (b) shall be had for any

Any person who brings an action for infringement knowing that registration of the design was
obtained by a false or fraudulent representation materially affecting the rights under this chapter,
shall be liable in the sum of $10,000, or such part of that amount as the court may determine. That
amount shall be to compensate the defendant and shall be charged against the plaintiff and paid to
the defendant, in addition to such costs and attorney's fees of the defendant as may be assessed by the
court.

CHAPTER 14—UNAUTHORIZED USE OF PRE-1972 SOUND RECORDINGS
Sec.
1401. Unauthorized use of pre-1972 sound recordings.
§1401. Unauthorized use of pre-1972 sound recordings
(a) IN GENERAL.—
(1) UNAUTHORIZED ACTS.—Anyone who, on or before the last day of the applicable
transition period under paragraph (2), and without the consent of the rights owner, engages in
covered activity with respect to a sound recording fixed before February 15, 1972, shall be subject
to the remedies provided in sections 502 through 505 and 1203 to the same extent as an infringer
of copyright or a person that engages in unauthorized activity under chapter 12.
(2) TERM OF PROHIBITION.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The prohibition under paragraph (1)—
(i) subject to clause (ii), shall apply to a sound recording described in that paragraph—
(I) through December 31 of the year that is 95 years after the year of first publication;
and
(II) for a further transition period as prescribed under subparagraph (B) of this
paragraph; and
(ii) shall not apply to any sound recording after February 15, 2067.
(B) TRANSITION PERIODS.—
(i) PRE-1923 RECORDINGS.—In the case of a sound recording first published before
January 1, 1923, the transition period described in subparagraph (A)(i)(II) shall end on
December 31 of the year that is 3 years after the date of enactment of this section.
(ii) 1923–1946 RECORDINGS.—In the case of a sound recording first published during
the period beginning on January 1, 1923, and ending on December 31, 1946, the transition
period described in subparagraph (A)(i)(II) shall end on the date that is 5 years after the last
day of the period described in subparagraph (A)(i)(I).

the period beginning on January 1, 1947, and ending on December 31, 1956, the transition

day of the period described in subparagraph (A)(i)(I).

[Release Point 118-106]
15, 1972, that is not described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii), the transition period described in
subparagraph (A)(i)(II) shall end on February 15, 2067.
(3) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—For the purposes of this subsection, the term "anyone"
includes any State, any instrumentality of a State, and any officer or employee of a State or
instrumentality of a State acting in the official capacity of the officer or employee, as applicable.
(b) CERTAIN AUTHORIZED TRANSMISSIONS AND REPRODUCTIONS.—A public
performance by means of a digital audio transmission of a sound recording fixed before February 15,
1972, or a reproduction in an ephemeral phonorecord or copy of a sound recording fixed before
February 15, 1972, shall, for purposes of subsection (a), be considered to be authorized and made
with the consent of the rights owner if—
(1) the transmission or reproduction would satisfy the requirements for statutory licensing under
section 112(e)(1) or section 114(d)(2), or would be exempt under section 114(d)(1), as the case
may be, if the sound recording were fixed on or after February 15, 1972; and
(2) the transmitting entity pays the statutory royalty for the transmission or reproduction
pursuant to the rates and terms adopted under sections 112(e) and 114(f), and complies with other
obligations, in the same manner as required by regulations adopted by the Copyright Royalty
Judges under sections 112(e) and 114(f) for sound recordings that are fixed on or after February
15, 1972, except in the case of a transmission that would be exempt under section 114(d)(1).
(c) CERTAIN NONCOMMERCIAL USES OF SOUND RECORDINGS THAT ARE NOT
BEING COMMERCIALLY EXPLOITED.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Noncommercial use of a sound recording fixed before February 15, 1972,
that is not being commercially exploited by or under the authority of the rights owner shall not
violate subsection (a) if—
(A) the person engaging in the noncommercial use, in order to determine whether the sound
recording is being commercially exploited by or under the authority of the rights owner, makes
a good faith, reasonable search for, but does not find, the sound recording—
(i) in the records of schedules filed in the Copyright Office as described in subsection
(f)(5)(A); and
(ii) on services offering a comprehensive set of sound recordings for sale or streaming;
(B) the person engaging in the noncommercial use files a notice identifying the sound
recording and the nature of the use in the Copyright Office in accordance with the regulations
issued under paragraph (3)(B); and
(C) during the 90-day period beginning on the date on which the notice described in
subparagraph (B) is indexed into the public records of the Copyright Office, the rights owner of
the sound recording does not, in its discretion, opt out of the noncommercial use by filing notice
thereof in the Copyright Office in accordance with the regulations issued under paragraph (5).
(2) RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.—For purposes of this subsection—
(A) merely recovering costs of production and distribution of a sound recording resulting
from a use otherwise permitted under this subsection does not itself necessarily constitute a
commercial use of the sound recording;
(B) the fact that a person engaging in the use of a sound recording also engages in
commercial activities does not itself necessarily render the use commercial; and
(C) the fact that a person files notice of a noncommercial use of a sound recording in
accordance with the regulations issued under paragraph (3)(B) does not itself affect any
limitation on the exclusive rights of a copyright owner described in section 107, 108, 109, 110,
or 112(f) as applied to a claim under subsection (a) of this section pursuant to subsection
(f)(1)(A) of this section.
[Release Point 118-106]
(3) NOTICE OF COVERED ACTIVITY.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment
of this section, the Register of Copyrights shall issue regulations that—
(A) provide specific, reasonable steps that, if taken by a filer, are sufficient to constitute a
good faith, reasonable search under paragraph (1)(A) to determine whether a recording is being
commercially exploited, including the services that satisfy the good faith, reasonable search
requirement under paragraph (1)(A) for purposes of the safe harbor described in paragraph
(4)(A); and

(1)(B).
(4) SAFE HARBOR.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—A person engaging in a noncommercial use of a sound recording
otherwise permitted under this subsection who establishes that the person made a good faith,
reasonable search under paragraph (1)(A) without finding commercial exploitation of the sound
recording by or under the authority of the rights owner shall not be found to be in violation of
subsection (a).
(B) STEPS SUFFICIENT BUT NOT NECESSARY.—Taking the specific, reasonable steps
identified by the Register of Copyrights in the regulations issued under paragraph (3)(A) shall
be sufficient, but not necessary, for a filer to satisfy the requirement to conduct a good faith,
reasonable search under paragraph (1)(A) for purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.
(5) OPTING OUT OF COVERED ACTIVITY.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this section, the
Register of Copyrights shall issue regulations establishing the form, content, and procedures for
the rights owner of a sound recording that is the subject of a notice under paragraph (1)(B) to, in
its discretion, file notice opting out of the covered activity described in the notice under
paragraph (1)(B) during the 90-day period beginning on the date on which the notice under
paragraph (1)(B) is indexed into the public records of the Copyright Office.
(B) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—The fact that a rights holder opts out of a
noncommercial use of a sound recording by filing notice thereof in the Copyright Office in
accordance with the regulations issued under subparagraph (A) does not itself enlarge or
diminish any limitation on the exclusive rights of a copyright owner described in section 107,
108, 109, 110, or 112(f) as applied to a claim under subsection (a) of this section pursuant to
subsection (f)(1)(A) of this section.

that is not less than $250, and not more than $1000, for each such notice, in addition to any
other remedies that may be available under this title based on the actual use made.
(B) FILING OF OPT-OUT NOTICES.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—Any person who files an opt-out notice as described in paragraph
(1)(C), knowing that the person is not the rights owner or authorized to act on behalf of the

penalty in an amount not less than $250, and not more than $1,000, for each such notice.
(ii) PATTERN OR PRACTICE.—Any person who engages in a pattern or practice of
making filings as described in clause (i) shall be assessed a civil penalty in an amount not less
than $10,000 for each such filing.
(C) DEFINITION.—For purposes of this paragraph, the term "knowing"—
(i) does not require specific intent to defraud; and
[Release Point 118-106]
(ii) with respect to information about ownership of the sound recording in question, means
that the person—
(I) has actual knowledge of the information;
(II) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information; or

licensing under section 114(d)(2) or been exempt under section 114(d)(1), or the reproduction

audio transmission under that agreement.
(2) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION FOR COMMON LAW COPYRIGHT.—For purposes of

includes a claim that characterizes conduct subject to that paragraph as an unlawful distribution,
act of record piracy, or similar violation.

(f) REVIEW OF CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS.—
(1) CLAIMS.—Upon the filing of a claim under subsection (e), the claim shall be reviewed by a
Copyright Claims Attorney to ensure that the claim complies with this chapter and applicable
regulations, subject to the following:
(A) If the claim is found to comply, the claimant shall be notified regarding that compliance
and instructed to proceed with service of the claim under subsection (g).
(B) If the claim is found not to comply, the claimant shall be notified that the claim is
deficient and be permitted to file an amended claim not later than 30 days after the date on
which the claimant receives the notice, without the requirement of an additional filing fee. If the
claimant files a compliant claim within that 30-day period, the claimant shall be so notified and
be instructed to proceed with service of the claim. If the claim is refiled within that 30-day
period and still fails to comply, the claimant shall again be notified that the claim is deficient
and shall be provided a second opportunity to amend the claim not later than 30 days after the
date of that second notice, without the requirement of an additional filing fee. If the claim is
refiled again within that second 30-day period and is compliant, the claimant shall be so notified
and shall be instructed to proceed with service of the claim, but if the claim still fails to comply,
upon confirmation of such noncompliance by a Copyright Claims Officer, the proceeding shall
be dismissed without prejudice. The Copyright Claims Board shall also dismiss without
prejudice any proceeding in which a compliant claim is not filed within the applicable 30-day
period.
(C)(i) Subject to clause (ii), for purposes of this paragraph, a claim against an online service
provider for infringement by reason of the storage of or referral or linking to infringing material
[Release Point 118-106]
that may be subject to the limitations on liability set forth in subsection (b), (c), or (d) of section
512 shall be considered noncompliant unless the claimant affirms in the statement required
under subsection (e)(1) of this section that the claimant has previously notified the service
provider of the claimed infringement in accordance with subsection (b)(2)(E), (c)(3), or (d)(3)
of section 512, as applicable, and the service provider failed to remove or disable access to the
material expeditiously upon the provision of such notice.
(ii) If a claim is found to be noncompliant under clause (i), the Copyright Claims Board shall
provide the claimant with information concerning the service of such a notice under the
applicable provision of section 512.
(2) COUNTERCLAIMS.—Upon the filing and service of a counterclaim, the counterclaim
shall be reviewed by a Copyright Claims Attorney to ensure that the counterclaim complies with
the provisions of this chapter and applicable regulations. If the counterclaim is found not to
comply, the counterclaimant and the other parties to the proceeding shall be notified that the
counterclaim is deficient, and the counterclaimant shall be permitted to file and serve an amended
counterclaim not later than 30 days after the date of such notice. If the counterclaimant files and
serves a compliant counterclaim within that 30-day period, the counterclaimant and such other
parties shall be so notified. If the counterclaim is refiled and served within that 30-day period but
still fails to comply, the counterclaimant and such other parties shall again be notified that the
counterclaim is deficient, and the counterclaimant shall be provided a second opportunity to
amend the counterclaim not later than 30 days after the date of the second notice. If the
counterclaim is refiled and served again within that second 30-day period and is compliant, the
counterclaimant and such other parties shall be so notified, but if the counterclaim still fails to
comply, upon confirmation of such noncompliance by a Copyright Claims Officer, the
counterclaim, but not the proceeding, shall be dismissed without prejudice.
(3) DISMISSAL FOR UNSUITABILITY.—The Copyright Claims Board shall dismiss a claim
or counterclaim without prejudice if, upon reviewing the claim or counterclaim, or at any other
time in the proceeding, the Copyright Claims Board concludes that the claim or counterclaim is
unsuitable for determination by the Copyright Claims Board, including on account of any of the
following:
(A) The failure to join a necessary party.
(B) The lack of an essential witness, evidence, or expert testimony.
(C) The determination of a relevant issue of law or fact that could exceed either the number
of proceedings the Copyright Claims Board could reasonably administer or the subject matter
competence of the Copyright Claims Board.
(g) SERVICE OF NOTICE AND CLAIMS.—In order to proceed with a claim against a

law and, if so, the appropriate relief and damages, if any, to be awarded.
(2) If the Copyright Claims Board makes an affirmative determination under paragraph (1), the
Copyright Claims Board shall prepare a proposed default determination, and shall provide written
notice to the respondent at all addresses, including email addresses, reflected in the records of the
