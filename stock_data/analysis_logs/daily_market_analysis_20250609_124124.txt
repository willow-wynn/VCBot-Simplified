    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress, suggesting potential legislative action impacting markets. Executive actions are limited, indicating possible gridlock. Public sentiment is mixed, with some support for government initiatives but also concerns about economic conditions. News velocity is moderate, indicating a steady flow of information but no major market-moving events.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth signals stagflation. Low market confidence and high unemployment further exacerbate the situation. The Fed's inability to control inflation is a major concern. The negative GDP growth is the primary driver for the negative trend direction.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to stagflationary pressures. High volatility is expected due to uncertainty surrounding inflation and economic growth. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, assuming eventual policy adjustments and economic recovery. Sector rotation will likely favor defensive sectors such as healthcare and consumer staples.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the large deviation of inflation from the Fed's target. Market sentiment is low, aligning with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting the still-low unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced due to the current economic challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Neutral. High inflation supports energy prices, but recessionary fears limit upside.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Discretionary spending declines due to economic downturn.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Interest rate uncertainty and potential loan defaults weigh on financials.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Defensive sector, less sensitive to economic cycles.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Mixed outlook, dependent on infrastructure spending and global demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral. Consumer spending is mixed, with staples outperforming discretionary.",
    "TECH": "Neutral. High growth potential, but sensitive to interest rate hikes and valuation concerns.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Reduced economic activity impacts transportation demand."
