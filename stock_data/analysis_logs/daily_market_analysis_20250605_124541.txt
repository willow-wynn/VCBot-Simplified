  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in political and congressional discussions, but limited direct market-related analysis. The presence of political ads suggests potential volatility related to policy changes. The focus on political and governmental processes indicates a possible distraction from economic fundamentals, contributing to market uncertainty.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) necessitates a hawkish monetary policy stance, likely leading to further economic contraction. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) confirms a recessionary environment. Unemployment (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), indicating a weakening labor market. These factors collectively point towards a bearish market outlook.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the negative economic indicators and low market confidence (35%), a bearish market outlook is warranted. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely pressure corporate earnings and valuations. The political uncertainty reflected in Discord activity adds to the overall market risk. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction: Set to -0.30 to reflect negative GDP growth and overall economic downturn. volatility: Increased to 1.10 due to high inflation and market uncertainty. market_sentiment: Matches the low market confidence at 0.35. momentum: Reduced to 0.20 to reflect slowing economic growth. long_term_outlook: Slightly decreased to 0.35 to reflect the challenging economic environment."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Neutral. High energy prices due to inflation provide some support, but potential demand destruction from recession poses a risk. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to be range-bound.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decline in a recession, negatively impacting entertainment companies. DIS and NFLX face headwinds.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and a slowing economy will pressure financial institutions. JPM, BAC, V, and GS are expected to underperform.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally more resilient in economic downturns, but faces regulatory risks. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are expected to be relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing is sensitive to economic cycles and will likely suffer from reduced demand. CAT and GE face challenges.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is expected to decline, negatively impacting retail companies. WMT, COST, and HD face headwinds.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. While some tech companies are resilient, overall sector growth is expected to slow. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA face mixed prospects.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Reduced economic activity will negatively impact transportation companies. BA faces headwinds due to economic uncertainty and supply chain issues. LMT benefits from geopolitical tensions."
