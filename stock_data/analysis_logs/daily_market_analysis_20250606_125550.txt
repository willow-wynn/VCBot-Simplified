    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress and Executive channels, indicating focus on legislative and governmental actions. The public square discussion about campaigns in North Dakota suggests some interest in regional politics. Overall, the discord activity does not significantly impact the market, but the vetoed bill could create some uncertainty.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) is a major concern. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates a recessionary environment. Unemployment (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low (35%), reflecting the overall economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish due to the negative economic indicators. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely put downward pressure on stock prices. Low market confidence further exacerbates the situation. Expect increased volatility and a general decline in the market. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles (e.g., Finance, Consumer Discretionary) will likely underperform, while defensive sectors (e.g., Healthcare, Consumer Staples) may offer some relative protection.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction: Set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic downturn.\nvolatility: Increased to 1.10 due to high inflation and economic uncertainty.\nmarket_sentiment: Aligned with the low market confidence at 0.35.\nmomentum: Reduced to 0.20 to reflect the slowing economic momentum and rising unemployment.\nlong_term_outlook: Adjusted slightly downward to 0.35 to reflect the current economic challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to persistent inflation and supply constraints. Expect continued high energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook due to recessionary fears and reduced consumer spending on discretionary items.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative outlook due to potential interest rate hikes and economic slowdown impacting lending and investment activities.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to positive outlook. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector and may outperform during economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook due to slowing economic growth and potential decline in capital expenditures.",
    "RETAIL": "Mixed outlook. Consumer staples (e.g., WMT, COST) may hold up better than discretionary retail.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to negative outlook. Tech companies are sensitive to economic cycles, but some may benefit from increased demand for cloud computing and digital services.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative outlook due to slowing economic activity and reduced demand for transportation services."
