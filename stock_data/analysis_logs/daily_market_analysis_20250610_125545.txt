  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity indicates low confidence and a slightly bearish sentiment. The 'coffin' reference in Public Square suggests a negative outlook. Executive messages are minimal, indicating a lack of strong leadership signals. News channel activity is also low. Overall, the discord activity reinforces the negative economic indicators.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) far exceeds the Fed's target of 2.0%, necessitating potentially aggressive monetary policy. GDP growth is negative (-1.2%), signaling a recession. Unemployment is low (3.2%), but this could be a lagging indicator. Market confidence is very low at 35%.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely weigh on corporate earnings and investor sentiment. Expect increased volatility. Energy sector might outperform due to inflation. Tech and Finance sectors are vulnerable. Long term outlook is cautiously optimistic, assuming the Fed can eventually tame inflation without causing a deep recession.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (1.15) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is set to 0.35, mirroring the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive (0.25) as the low unemployment rate provides some support. Long-term outlook is slightly decreased to 0.41, reflecting the increased risk of recession."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints will likely support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer discretionary spending will be impacted by inflation and recession fears.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and a slowing economy will hurt bank earnings and increase loan losses.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces cost pressures.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. A slowing economy will reduce demand for manufactured goods.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending will decline as inflation erodes purchasing power.",
    "TECH": "Negative. High valuations and slowing growth make the tech sector vulnerable to a correction.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Mixed outlook. Lower consumer spending will reduce demand, but infrastructure spending could provide some support."
