IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE
January 13th, 2022
Mr. Lilburne (for himself) introduced the following bill;
A BILL
To end State Legislatures’ ability to ban union security agreements
Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress Assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘Freedom of Association Act’
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(a) The ability to ban union security agreements is explicitly granted to state legislatures by statute
under the US Code.
(b) That the Supreme Court clearly ruled that Congress has the constitutional power, under the
Commerce Clause, to regulate labor relations in National Labor Relations Board v Jones &
Laughlin Steel Corporation, 301 U.S. 1 (1937)
(c) Enshrining state prohibition of such agreements in the US Code is contrary to the principle that
Federal Law should regard trade unions with neutrality

SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO US CODE
(a) To strike §164. b of the U.S.C., which currently states:
Agreements requiring union membership in violation of State law
(b) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as authorizing the execution or application of
agreements requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment in any State
or Territory in which such execution or application is prohibited by State or Territorial law.
In General. — Section 164(b) of Title 29 of the United States Code is Hereby Repealed.
SEC. 5. ENACTMENT.
EFFECTIVE DATE.— The provisions of this Act shall come into force immediately upon passage.
