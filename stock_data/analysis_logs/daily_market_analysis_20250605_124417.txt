    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Market confidence is low, and unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, further dampening the outlook. The parameter adjustments reflect this negative economic environment.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish due to the stagflationary environment. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles, such as finance and consumer discretionary, are likely to underperform. Energy and healthcare may offer some relative stability.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative to reflect the GDP contraction. Volatility is increased due to high inflation. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence. Momentum is reduced due to the weak economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic uncertainty."

    "ENERGY": "Energy sector is expected to perform relatively well due to persistent inflation and potential supply constraints. XOM, CVX, and COP are favored.",

    "FINANCE": "Financial sector is vulnerable to rising interest rates and potential loan defaults. JPM, BAC, V, and GS are expected to face challenges.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector is considered defensive and may offer some stability during economic downturns. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are favored.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is sensitive to economic cycles and may face reduced demand. CAT and GE are likely to underperform.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector faces challenges due to reduced consumer spending and inflationary pressures. WMT, COST, and HD are expected to face headwinds.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector is mixed. While some companies may face reduced demand, others may benefit from increased adoption of technology. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are expected to be volatile.",
    "TRANSPORT": "The transport sector outlook is negative due to decreased manufacturing. BA is likely to underperform."
