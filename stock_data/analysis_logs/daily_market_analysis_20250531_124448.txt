  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of political commentary and general discussion, with limited direct focus on specific stocks. The high volume in Public Square and Congress suggests a general awareness of current events, but the lack of specific financial discussion implies a neutral impact on the market. The Executive channel's activity is minimal and unlikely to influence market sentiment significantly. The low activity in States and News channels further reduces the impact of Discord on market movements.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a challenging environment. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) necessitates a hawkish monetary policy, contributing to negative GDP growth (-1.2%). The unemployment rate (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), indicating some labor market weakness. Market confidence is low at 35%, reflecting the overall economic uncertainty. These factors collectively point towards a bearish market outlook.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely pressure corporate earnings and investor sentiment. The low market confidence reinforces this negative outlook. Expect increased volatility and a downward trend in stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles, such as finance and consumer discretionary, may underperform, while defensive sectors like healthcare and energy could offer some resilience.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend Direction: Set to -0.25 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic downturn. Volatility: Set to 0.90 to account for the high inflation rate and economic uncertainty. Market Sentiment: Aligned with the market confidence of 35%. Momentum: Set to 0.20 to reflect the slowing economic growth and slightly elevated unemployment. Long-Term Outlook: Slightly reduced to 0.35 to reflect the current economic challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to high inflation and potential for increased demand. Expect stable performance.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook due to economic downturn and reduced consumer spending. Expect underperformance.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative outlook due to potential interest rate hikes and economic slowdown. Expect underperformance.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral outlook as healthcare is generally recession-resistant. Expect stable performance.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral outlook, dependent on infrastructure spending and global demand. Expect moderate performance.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative outlook due to reduced consumer spending and inflationary pressures. Expect underperformance.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to slightly negative outlook due to high valuation and potential for reduced growth. Expect moderate performance.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral outlook, dependent on global trade and economic activity. Expect moderate performance."
