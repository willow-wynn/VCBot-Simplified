  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on Congress and Public Square, with limited news discussion. This suggests a focus on internal political dynamics rather than external economic factors. The limited news discussion indicates a lack of immediate market-moving catalysts being discussed, leading to a slightly negative impact due to uncertainty.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) coupled with negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates stagflation. Market confidence is low (35%), and while unemployment is low (3.2%), it's approaching the natural rate, limiting further improvement. This necessitates a bearish outlook.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation will likely lead to continued interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, further dampening economic growth. Low market confidence and negative GDP growth suggest a potential for further market declines. Sectors sensitive to economic growth, such as finance and consumer discretionary, are expected to underperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.50) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (1.20) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to align with the reported market confidence. Momentum is slightly negative (0.45) to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced (0.55) to acknowledge the increased economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment may decline due to inflation. DIS and NFLX face headwinds.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and a slowing economy will negatively impact financial institutions. JPM, BAC, and GS are expected to underperform.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces regulatory uncertainty. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are expected to be relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral to Negative. Manufacturing activity may slow down due to reduced demand. CAT and GE face mixed prospects.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. High inflation will reduce consumer spending, particularly on non-essential items. WMT, COST, and HD face challenges.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies face headwinds from rising interest rates and potential regulation. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA face mixed prospects.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. The transport sector is sensitive to economic activity. BA and LMT face mixed prospects, with LMT potentially benefiting from geopolitical tensions."
