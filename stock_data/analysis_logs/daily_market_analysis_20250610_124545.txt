    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a slight negative sentiment, primarily driven by concerns expressed in the Public Square and Executive channels. The Congress channel remains focused on legislative matters, with minimal direct impact on market sentiment. News channel activity is low, suggesting a lack of major breaking events.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) is a major headwind. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) signals a potential recession. While unemployment is low (3.2%), it's approaching the natural rate, limiting further improvement. These factors contribute to overall economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to high inflation and negative GDP growth. Market confidence is low, indicating investor hesitancy. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Long-term outlook remains uncertain, dependent on the Fed's ability to control inflation and stimulate economic growth.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (0.95) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence (0.35). Momentum is slightly positive (0.25) due to the low unemployment rate, but is countered by the negative GDP. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.41 to reflect the current economic headwinds."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector shows relative strength due to persistent inflation and supply constraints. Expect continued, but tempered, gains.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector faces headwinds due to consumer spending cuts during economic downturns. Expect underperformance.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector is vulnerable to rising interest rates and potential loan defaults. Expect underperformance.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector is relatively stable, but faces pressure from government regulations and cost controls. Expect neutral performance.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is negatively impacted by slowing economic growth and supply chain disruptions. Expect underperformance.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector faces challenges due to decreased consumer spending and inflationary pressures. Expect underperformance.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector is highly sensitive to interest rate hikes and economic slowdown. Expect underperformance.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector is affected by decreased economic activity and rising fuel costs. Expect underperformance."
