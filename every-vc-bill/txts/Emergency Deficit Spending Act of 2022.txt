IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED
STATES
February 2, 2022
Mr. RICCA of Olympia (for himself) introduced the following joint resolution;
⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
A JOINT RESOLUTION
Providing for allowing emergency deficit spending in accordance to the 40th
Amendment of the United States Constitution
Whereas, the specification of “specific expenditure” within the 40th
Amendment can be theoretically construed to require exact dollar amounts for
every dollar spent, within the resolution to declare a state of emergency;
Whereas, on January 24th, 2022, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a
GDP decrease of 9% and an unemployment rate greater than 9%, heightening
national concerns regarding the United States economy;
Whereas, the Economic Relief Act, 2020, provides a framework to sustain
workers and businesses in an unemployment crisis;
Whereas, the program has been underfunded due to the stipulations of the
Balanced Budget Amendment;

Whereas, keeping American workers on payroll and avoiding further loss
of jobs is a key element to avoid a catastrophic worsening of the current economic
conditions;
Whereas, Congress holds the responsibility to contribute and act
accordingly, in the minimisation of economic damages to the United States:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled (thirteen-twentieths of each House concurring
therein),
That pursuant to Amendment 40, section 2 of the United State Constitution,
Congress declares a state of emergency within the United States, due to the
cyclical deficit and the current unemployment and GDP figures within the
United States. That there are for the purposes of direct payments and general
funding of the government, authorised to be appropriated the following values in
excess of the limit as per specifications of section 1 of the 40th Amendment to the
United States Constitution. This resolution allows deficit spending to the value
of $40,000,000,000 for the funding of the programmes instituted under Economic
Relief Act, 2020. The Secretary of Labour shall have the right to assess which
specific program, be it the Business Relief Program, the Special Business Relief
Program or the Extraordinary Business Relief Program, as deemed more
appropriate to alleviate the strains on the US economic system.
Provided that, this resolution shall not be intended as preventing any
other, parallel declaration of a state of emergency under the 40th amendment.
Further provided that, this Congress Resolves that, were the Secretary to
find the sum of $40,000,000,000 not sufficient, they shall report to the House and
the Senate, which reserve themselves the right to expand the allocation of
monies with regards to the programmes described in this Resolution.
Further provided that, were any part, sentence, phrase or word of this
Resolution to be found in violation of the law, of the Constitution or of its
Amendments, this Congress declares that it would pass each part, sentence,
phrase or word independently, as long as the general intent of the Resolution is
preserved.
This Congress further asks the Court, in adjudicating the legality or
constitutionality of this Resolution to, before resorting to severing any part of
this Resolution, to adopt the interpretation of it that may render it most
compatible with the laws and Constitution of the United States, as long as the
general intent of this Resolution is preserved.
