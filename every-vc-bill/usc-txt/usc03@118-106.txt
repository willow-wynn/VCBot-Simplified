MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT
To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith transmit my plan for the Reorganization of the Executive Office of the President (EOP),
Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977. This plan is the first of a series I intend to submit under the reorganization
authority vested in me by the Reorganization Act of 1977 (Public Law 95–17) [5 U.S.C. 901–912]. It adheres
to the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of the Act [5 U.S.C. 901(a)].
This plan in conjunction with the other steps I am taking will:
Eliminate seven of the seventeen units now within the EOP and modify the rest. There were 19 units
when I took office; the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and the Economic Policy Board
have already been abolished. Thus with this plan I will have eliminated nine of 19 EOP units.
Reduce EOP staffing by about 250 which includes the White House staff reduction of 134 or 28
percent which I have already ordered.
Improve efficiency by centralizing administrative functions; and
Improve the process by which information is provided for Presidential decisionmaking.
These recommendations arise from a careful, systematic study of the EOP. They are based on the premise
that the EOP exists to serve the President and should be structured to meet his needs. They will reduce waste
and cost while improving the service the President, and the nation, receive from the EOP.
The EOP now consists of the immediate White House Office, the Vice President's Office, the Office of
Management and Budget, and fourteen other agencies. The EOP has a budget authority of about $80,000,000
and 1,712 full time employees.
The White House Office concentrates on close personal support including policy and political advice and
administrative and operational services. The Office of the Vice President provides similar support to him.
OMB's primary mission is to develop and implement the budget; it also carries out a number of management
and reorganization activities.
Three EOP units have responsibility for policy development:
National Security Council.
Domestic Council.
Council on International Economic Policy.
The other 11 are more specialized offices that offer analysis and advice, help develop policy in certain
areas, or carry out special projects. These are:
Council of Economic Advisers.
Council on Wage and Price Stability.
Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.
Council on Environmental Quality.
Office of Science and Technology Policy.
Office of Drug Abuse Policy.
Office of Telecommunications Policy.
Intelligence Oversight Board.
Federal Property Council.
[Release Point 118-106]
Energy Resources Council.
Economic Opportunity Council.
To make the EOP more effective, four steps are necessary:
I. Strengthen management of policy issues.
II. Limit the EOP, wherever possible, to functions directly related to the President's work.
III. Centralize administrative services.
IV. Reduce size of White House and EOP staffs.
I. STRENGTHEN PROCESS MANAGEMENT OF POLICY ISSUES
Perhaps the most important function of the President's staff is to make sure he has the wide variety of views
and facts he needs to make decisions. By building a more orderly system for collecting information and
advice, the President can make sure that he will hear all the views he should—and hear them in time. To better
insure that this happens, I am taking the following actions to:
Institute for domestic and economic issues, a system similar to the Presidential Review Memorandum
process currently used for National Security issues.
Create a committee of Presidential advisers, chaired by the Vice President, to set priorities among
issues and oversee their staffing.
Assure that Presidential decision memoranda on policy issues are coordinated with Cabinet and EOP
advisers most involved with the issue.
Consolidate under the Staff Secretary the two current White House paper circulation systems.
Appoint a group of advisers to review the decisionmaking process periodically.
Give the Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and Policy clear responsibility for managing
the way in which domestic and most economic policy issues are prepared for Presidential decision.
Assign follow-up responsibility for Presidential decisions as follows: immediate follow-up will be
handled by the NSC or Domestic Policy Staff most directly involved in the issue; long term follow-up on
selected issues will be handled by the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Relations.
These actions recognize that the White House and Executive Office staff must use their proximity to the
President to insure that the full resources of the government and the public are brought to bear on Presidential
decisions in a timely fashion. It is my purpose in instituting these changes to strengthen Cabinet participation
in Presidential decisions.
II. RATIONALIZE EOP STRUCTURE BY LIMITING EOP, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, TO
FUNCTIONS WHICH BEAR A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO THE WORK OF THE
PRESIDENT
As the President's principal staff institution, there are several major things the EOP must do:
Provide day-to-day operational support (e.g., scheduling, appointments) and help the President
communicate with the public, the Congress, and the press.
Manage the budget and coordinate Administration positions on matters before the Congress.
Manage the Presidential decisionmaking processes efficiently and fairly, and bring the President the
widest possible range of opinions.
Help the President: plan and set priorities; monitor and evaluate progress toward achieving the
President's objectives; understand and resolve major conflicts among line subordinates; manage crises,
especially in national security matters.
In order to restructure the EOP around these basic functions, the functions of seven units should be
discontinued or transferred, and ten units, including the White House Office, should be retained but modified.
Seven units should be discontinued or their functions transferred. These are:
1. Office of Drug Abuse Policy.
2. Office of Telecommunications Policy.
3. Council on International Economic Policy.
4. Federal Property Council.
5. Energy Resources Council.
6. Economic Opportunity Council.
7. Domestic Council.
The functions of the Office of Drug Abuse Policy (ODAP) can be performed by a smaller staff reporting to
a Presidential adviser in the EOP. The Office itself will be discontinued.
Much of the work done by the Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP) can be more effectively
performed outside the EOP. It is important that the EOP have the capacity to resolve differences and that the
President have immediate advice on telecommunications and information policy, especially on national
[Release Point 118-106]
security, emergency preparedness and privacy issues. This only requires a small staff within EOP. The Office
of Management and Budget would take responsibility for Federal telecommunications procurement and
management policy and arbitration of interagency disputes about frequency allocation. All other functions
except developing Presidential policy options would be transferred to a new office within the Department of
Commerce, headed by a new Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, who will perform
many of the functions previously performed by the head of the OTP.
I propose that the Economic Opportunity Council be discontinued; it is dormant and its only active function
(preparation of the Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance) is being performed by OMB. Three other units
are also inactive and should be discontinued: Council on International Economic Policy, the Federal Property
Council, and the Energy Resources Council.
The Domestic Council should be abolished. It has rarely functioned as a Council, because it is too large and
its membership too diverse to make decisions efficiently. Its functions have been performed entirely by its
staff. This Domestic Policy Staff should report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and
Policy. Under the policy process system described earlier, they should manage the process which coordinates
the making of domestic and most economic policy. They should work closely with the Cabinet departments
and agencies to insure that the views of the Cabinet and agency heads are brought to the President before
decisions are made.
The ten EOP units which will continue with some modification are:
1. White House Office.
2. Office of the Vice President.
3. Office of Management and Budget.
4. Council on Environmental Quality.
5. Council of Economic Advisers.
6. Office of Science and Technology Policy.
7. Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.
8. National Security Council.
9. Intelligence Oversight Board.
10. Council on Wage and Price Stability.
The operations of the Office of the Vice President reflect the combination of constitutional, statutory, and
Presidentially assigned duties that make it unique among EOP units. Because his interests and assignments
cover the same range as the President's, the Vice President requires a staff with expertise in diverse areas. Its
basic functions should not be changed. However, I propose that certain support functions—involving
accounting, personnel services, and supply—be transferred to a centralized EOP Administrative Unit.
The Office of Management and Budget would remain as a separate entity in the EOP, but some functional
changes should be made. Four functions should be transferred from OMB to other parts of the government:
Administration to the new EOP Central Administrative Unit;
Executive Department/Labor Relations (except for Pay Agent, Executive Level Pools, and Legislative
Analysis) to the Civil Service Commission;
Advisory Committee Management Secretariat to the General Services Administration;
Statistical Policy (except Forms Clearance) to the Department of Commerce.
I have asked the OMB to reorganize its management arm to emphasize major Presidential initiatives, such
as reorganization, program evaluation, paperwork reduction, and regulatory reform.
The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) should remain in the EOP as an environmental adviser to the
President. The CEQ's major purpose is to provide an independent assessment of our policies for improving the
environment. Toward this end, it will analyze long term trends and conditions in the environment. It will
advise OMB on the reorganization of natural resources functions within the Federal government. The Council
will retain the functions it now has under NEPA and Executive Order No. 11514 with the exception of routine
review of the adequacy of impact statements and the administrative aspects of their receipt and handling. The
EPA will take over CEQ's evaluation responsibility under the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research
Development Act of 1974 [section 5901 et seq. of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare]. The CEQ will
continue to review and publish the Annual Report on Environmental Quality.
The strength of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEQ) lies in its economic analysis of current policy
choices. It also presents objective economic data, makes macroeconomic forecasts, and analyzes economic
trends and their impact on the national economy. It will continue with a small reduction in staff.
The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) should retain those science, engineering, and
technology functions which can be so useful in helping the President and his advisers make decisions about
policy and budget issues. Instead of the Intergovernmental Science, Engineering, and Technology Advisory
Panels, the President should rely on an intergovernmental relations working group, chaired by the Science
[Release Point 118-106]
Adviser. The Federal Coordinating Council on Science and Technology should operate as a sub-Cabinet
working group chaired by the Science Adviser. The reorganization work of the President's Committee on
Science and Technology would be part of the overall reorganization effort. The responsibility for preparing
certain reports should be transferred to the National Science Foundation.
The proposal places manageable limits on OSTP's broad mandate while emphasizing functions that support
the President.
The Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations (STR) is now operating effectively and
will be retained essentially as is. With the difficult negotiations now underway in Geneva, the benefits of
transferring the STR to another agency are outweighed by the potential reduction in its effectiveness as an
international negotiator.
The National Security Council (NSC) will be retained in its present form and its staff slightly reduced.
Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB) should be retained to insure that abuses of the past are not repeated and
to emphasize Presidential concerns regarding intelligence issues.
The Council of Wage and Price Stability (COWPS) is a necessary weapon in the continuing fight against
inflation and will be retained. To be sure that its work is closely coordinated with the economic analyses
performed by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), COWPS should be directed by the Chairman of
CEA.
III. CENTRALIZE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS
About 380 (22 percent) of the full-time, permanent EOP personnel perform administrative support services
in EOP units. Most EOP units besides the White House and OMB are too small to provide a full complement
of administrative services. They depend on the White House, OMB, GSA, other federal departments, or
several of these sources for many of these services. This approach is inefficient; the quality is uneven and the
coordination poor. Some services are duplicated, others inconsistently distributed (excess capacity in some
units and deficiencies in others), and most too costly.
I propose to combine administrative support operations into a Central Administrative Unit in EOP to
provide support in administrative services common to all EOP entities. It should be a separate EOP entity
because of the need to assure equal access by all other units.
This consolidation will result in:
Saving of roughly 40 positions and about $1.1 million, improved and more innovative services.
A focus for monitoring the efficiency and responsibility of administrative services.
A base for an effective EOP budget/planning system through which the President can manage an
integrated EOP rather than a collection of disparate units.
The EOP has never before been organized as a single, unified entity serving the President. It is only by
viewing it as a whole that we can improve efficiency through steps like the Central Administrative Unit.
IV. REDUCE THE SIZE OF WHITE HOUSE AND EOP STAFFS
I am reducing the White House staff by 28 percent, from the 485 I inherited from my predecessor to 351.
This involves cuts in my policy and administrative staffs as well as transfers to the Central Administrative
Unit.
I estimate that this plan and the other steps I am taking will reduce staff levels in the EOP by about 250,
from 1,712 full-time permanent positions to about 1,460 and will save the taxpayers at least $6 million.
As in the rest of the government, I will be reluctant to add staff unless necessary to help me do my job
better.
I ask that you support me in improving the operations of the Executive Office of the President by approving
the attached reorganization plan.
In summary this plan would:
Abolish the Domestic Council and establish a Domestic Policy Staff.
Establish within the EOP a Central Administrative Unit.
Transfer certain functions of the Council on Environmental Quality to the President for redelegation.
Abolish the Office of Drug Abuse Policy and vest functions in the President for redelegation.
Abolish the Office of Telecommunications Policy and transfer functions to the Department of
Commerce and to the President for redelegation.
Create an Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information.
Vest some Office of Science and Technology Policy functions in the President for redelegation.
Abolish the Economic Opportunity Council and vest those functions in the President for redelegation.
Transfer the Committee Management Secretariat function of the Office of Management and Budget to
the President for redelegation.
Make other incidental transfers attendant to those mentioned above.
[Release Point 118-106]
Each of the changes set forth in the plan accompanying this message is necessary to accomplish one or
more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code. I have taken care to
determine that all functions abolished by the plan are done so only under statutory authority provided by
Section 903(b) of Title 5 of the United States Code. The provisions in the plan for the appointment and pay of
any head or officer of any agency have been found by me to be necessary.
As we continue our studies of other parts of the Executive Branch, we will find more ways to improve
services in the EOP and elsewhere. This plan is only a beginning, but I am confident that it represents a major
step toward a more efficient government that will serve the needs of the people and the President well.

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,

SECTION 1. Policy. About 80 percent of Americans live in urban areas, and the economic health and social
vitality of our urban communities are critically important to the prosperity and quality of life for Americans.
Vibrant cities spawn innovation, economic growth, and cultural enrichment through the businesses,
universities, and civic, cultural, religious, and nonprofit institutions they attract. Forward-looking policies that
encourage wise investment and development in our urban areas will create employment and housing
opportunities and make our country more competitive, prosperous, and strong. In the past, insufficient
attention has been paid to the problems faced by urban areas and to coordinating the many Federal programs
that affect our cities. A more comprehensive approach is needed, both to develop an effective strategy for
urban America and to coordinate the actions of the many executive departments and agencies whose actions
impact urban life.

(c) to work with executive departments and agencies to ensure that appropriate consideration is given by
such departments and agencies to the potential impact of their actions on urban areas;
(d) to work with executive departments and agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget, to
ensure that Federal Government dollars targeted to urban areas are effectively spent on the highest-impact
programs; and
(e) to engage in outreach and work closely with State and local officials, with nonprofit organizations, and
with the private sector, both in seeking input regarding the development of a comprehensive urban policy and
in ensuring that the implementation of Federal programs advances the objectives of that policy.
SEC. 4. Coordination. In performing its functions, the Office shall work closely with all relevant executive
departments and agencies, and offices and councils within the Executive Office of the President, including but
not limited to:
(a) the Department of the Treasury;
(b) the Department of Justice;
(c) the Department of Commerce;
(d) the Department of Labor;
(e) the Department of Health and Human Services;
(f) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;
(g) the Department of Transportation;
(h) the Department of Energy;
(i) the Department of Education; and
(j) the Environmental Protection Agency.
SEC. 5. Administration. (a) The Office may work with established or ad hoc committees, task forces, and
interagency groups.
(b) The Office shall have a staff headed by the Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Urban
Affairs (Director). The Director shall report jointly to the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental
Affairs and Public Liaison and to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. The Office shall have
such staff and other assistance as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this order.
(c) All executive departments and agencies shall cooperate with the Office and provide such information,
support, and assistance to the Office as the Director may request, to the extent permitted by law.
SEC. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) authority granted by law to a department, agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary,
administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of
appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural,
enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its
officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
and in order to better serve people in need through partnerships with civil society, while preserving our

SECTION 1. Policy. Faith-based and other community-serving organizations are vital to our Nation's
ability to address the needs of, and lift up, low-income and other underserved persons and communities,
notably including persons of color. The American people are key drivers of fundamental change in our
country, and few institutions are closer to the people than our faith-based and other community organizations.
It is important that the Federal Government strengthen the ability of such organizations and other nonprofit
providers in our communities to deliver services effectively in partnership with Federal, State, and local
governments and with other private organizations, while preserving our fundamental constitutional
commitments guaranteeing the equal protection of the laws and the free exercise of religion and forbidding the
establishment of religion. The Federal Government can preserve these fundamental commitments while
empowering faith-based and secular organizations to assist in the delivery of vital services in our
neighborhoods. These partnerships are also vital for the success and effectiveness of the United States'
diplomatic, international development, and humanitarian work around the world.

Partnerships (White House Partnerships Office) within the Executive Office of the President, supported by the

organizations, both faith-based and secular, to the extent permitted by law.
SEC. 3. Functions. The principal functions of the White House Partnerships Office are, to the extent
permitted by law:
(a) to assist in organizing more effective efforts to serve people in need across the country and around the
world, in partnership with civil society, including faith-based and secular organizations;
(b) to develop, lead, and coordinate the Administration's policy agenda affecting faith-based and other
community programs and initiatives and to optimize the role of such efforts in communities;
(c) to ensure that policy decisions and programs throughout the Federal Government are consistent with the
policy set forth in section 1 of this order with respect to faith-based and other community initiatives;
(d) to bring concerns, ideas, and policy options to Administration leadership for assisting, strengthening,
and replicating partnerships, whether financial or nonfinancial, with faith-based and other community
organizations; and
(e) to promote awareness among diverse civil society leaders of opportunities to partner—both financially
and otherwise—with the Federal Government to serve people in need and to build institutional capacity.
SEC. 4. Administration. (a) The White House Partnerships Office may make use of established or ad hoc
committees, task forces, or interagency groups.
(b) The White House Partnerships Office shall be led by an Executive Director and a Deputy Director. The
operations of the White House Partnerships Office shall begin within 30 days of the date of this order [Feb.
14, 2021].
(c) The White House Partnerships Office shall coordinate with the liaison and point of contact designated
by each executive department and agency (agency) with respect to this initiative.
(d) All agencies shall cooperate with the White House Partnerships Office and provide such information,
support, and assistance to the White House Partnerships Office as it may request, to the extent permitted by
law.
(e) In order to ensure that Federal programs and practices involving grants or contracts to faith-based
organizations are consistent with applicable law, the Executive Director of the White House Partnerships
Office, acting through the Counsel to the President, may seek the opinion of the Attorney General on any
constitutional and statutory questions involving existing or prospective programs and practices.
SEC. 5. Amendments to Executive Orders. (a) [Amended Ex. Ord. Nos. 13198, 13279, 13280, 13342, and
[Release Point 118-106]
13397, set out as notes under section 601 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.]
SEC. 6. Revocation. Executive Order 13831 of May 3, 2018 (Establishment of a White House Faith and
Opportunity Initiative) [formerly set out above], is revoked.
SEC. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary,
administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of
appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural,

WHITE HOUSE TASK FORCE ON MIDDLE-CLASS WORKING FAMILIES
Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 30, 2009, 74 F.R. 5979, provided:
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
For many years, middle-class Americans have been working harder, yet not enjoying their fair share of the
fruits of a growing economy. While the productivity of the American workforce grew during the decade
ending in 2007, middle-income workers saw their real incomes fall. The current economic situation has
exacerbated the challenges facing middle-class Americans, with health care coverage, safe and steady
employment opportunities, effective and affordable education, owning a home, and saving for retirement
slipping out of reach. It is a high priority of my Administration to achieve a secure future for middle-class
working families, one in which they share in prosperous times and are cushioned during hard times. To these
ends, I hereby direct the following:
SECTION 1. White House Task Force on Middle-Class Working Families. There is established within the
Office of the Vice President, a White House Task Force on Middle-Class Working Families (Task Force) to
focus on raising the living standards of middle-class working families in the United States of America. The

(9) such other executive branch departments, agencies, or offices as the President may designate.
A member of the Task Force may designate, to perform the Task Force functions of the member, any
person who is a part of the member's department, agency, or office, and who is a full-time officer or employee
of the Federal Government. At the direction of the Chair, the Task Force may establish subgroups consisting
exclusively of Task Force members or their designees under this section, as appropriate.
(b) ADMINISTRATION OF THE TASK FORCE. The Department of Labor shall provide funding and
administrative support for the Task Force to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations.
The Vice President shall designate an Executive Director of the Task Force, who shall coordinate the work of
the Task Force.
SEC. 2. Mission and Functions of the Task Force. The Task Force shall work with a wide array of
executive departments and agencies that have responsibility for key issues facing middle-class working
families, expedite administrative reforms, propose Executive Orders, and develop legislative and policy
proposals that can be of special importance to middle-class working families. The functions of the Task Force
are advisory only and shall include, but shall not be limited to, producing a detailed set of recommendations
to:
(a) expand education and lifelong training opportunities;
(b) improve work and family balance;
(c) restore labor standards, including workplace safety;
(d) protect the incomes of middle-class working families; and
[Release Point 118-106]
(e) protect retirement security.
SEC. 3. Outreach. Consistent with the objectives set out in section 2 of this memorandum, the Task Force,
in accordance with applicable law, in addition to regular meetings, shall conduct outreach with representatives
of labor, business, nonprofit organizations, State and local government agencies, and other interested persons
that will assist with the Task Force's development of a detailed set of recommendations.
SEC. 4. Transparency and Reports. The Task Force shall facilitate the posting on the Internet of
submissions by outside parties and engage in an open, two-way dialogue with the American people. The Task
Force shall present to the President annual reports, beginning 1 year from the date of this memorandum, on its
findings and recommendations, which shall be made available to the public and posted on the Internet.
SEC. 5. General Provisions. (a) The heads of executive departments and agencies shall assist and provide
information to the Task Force, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the functions
of the Task Force. Each executive department and agency shall bear its own expense for participating in the
Task Force.
(b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative,
or legislative proposals.
(c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of
appropriations.
(d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or
procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Federal Register.

"PURPOSE OF THIS ACT
"SEC. 2. The Congress declares it to be the purpose of this Act to promote the orderly transfer of the
executive power in connection with the expiration of the term of office of a President and the inauguration of
a new President. The national interest requires that such transitions in the office of President be accomplished
so as to assure continuity in the faithful execution of the laws and in the conduct of the affairs of the Federal
Government, both domestic and foreign. Any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power
could produce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the United States and its people.
Accordingly, it is the intent of the Congress that appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or
minimize any disruption. In addition to the specific provisions contained in this Act directed toward that
purpose, it is the intent of the Congress that all officers of the Government so conduct the affairs of the
Government for which they exercise responsibility and authority as (1) to be mindful of problems occasioned
by transitions in the office of President, (2) to take appropriate lawful steps to avoid or minimize disruptions
that might be occasioned by the transfer of the executive power, and (3) otherwise to promote orderly
transitions in the office of President.

EX. ORD. NO. 13867. ISSUANCE OF PERMITS WITH RESPECT TO FACILITIES AND LAND
TRANSPORTATION CROSSINGS AT THE INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARIES OF THE
UNITED STATES
Ex. Ord. No. 13867, Apr. 10, 2019, 84 F.R. 15491, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
including Article II of the Constitution, which gives the President authority over foreign affairs and the
authority to seek the opinions of principal officers, it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Purpose. Presidents have long exercised authority to permit or deny the construction,
connection, operation, or maintenance of infrastructure projects at an international border of the United States
(cross-border infrastructure). Over the course of several decades, executive actions, Federal regulations, and
policies of executive departments and agencies (agencies) related to the process of reviewing applications for
Presidential permits, and issuing or denying such permits, have unnecessarily complicated the Presidential
permitting process, thereby hindering the economic development of the United States and undermining the
efforts of the United States to foster goodwill and mutually productive economic exchanges with its
neighboring countries. To promote cross-border infrastructure and facilitate the expeditious delivery of advice
to the President regarding Presidential permitting decisions, this order revises the process for the development
and issuance of Presidential permits covering the construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of
certain facilities and land transportation crossings at the international boundaries of the United States.
SEC. 2. Cross-Border Infrastructure Presidential Permit Application Procedures. (a) The Secretary of
State shall adopt procedures to ensure that all actions set forth in subsections (b) through (h) of this section
can be completed within 60 days of the receipt of an application for a Presidential permit for the types of
cross-border infrastructure identified in subsection (b) of this section.
(b) Except with respect to facilities covered by Executive Order 10485 of September 3, 1953 (Providing for
the Performance of Certain Functions Heretofore Performed by the President With Respect to Electric Power
and Natural Gas Facilities Located on the Borders of the United States), as amended [15 U.S.C. 717b note],
and section 5(a) of Executive Order 10530 of May 10, 1954 (Providing for the Performance of Certain
Functions Vested in or Subject to the Approval of the President) [set out above], the Secretary of State is
hereby designated to receive all applications for the issuance or amendment of Presidential permits for the
construction, connection, operation, or maintenance, at the international boundaries of the United States, of:
(i) pipelines, conveyor belts, and similar facilities for exportation or importation of all products to or from a
foreign country;
(ii) facilities for the exportation or importation of water or sewage to or from a foreign country;
(iii) facilities for the transportation of persons or things, or both, to or from a foreign country;
(iv) bridges, to the extent that congressional authorization is not required;
(v) similar facilities above or below ground; and
(vi) border crossings for land transportation, including motor and rail vehicles, to or from a foreign country,
whether or not in conjunction with the facilities identified in subsection (b)(iii) of this section.
(c) Upon receipt of an application pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of State may:
(i) request additional information from the applicant that the President may deem necessary; and
(ii) refer the application and pertinent information to heads of agencies specified by the President.
(d) The Secretary of State shall, as soon as practicable after receiving an application pursuant to subsection
(b) of this section, advise the President as to whether the President should request the opinion, in writing, of
any heads of agencies concerning the application and any related matter. Any agency heads whose opinion the
President requests shall provide views and render such assistance as may be requested, consistent with their
legal authority, in a timely manner, not to exceed 30 days from the date of a request, unless the President
otherwise specifies.
(e) With respect to each application, the Secretary of State may solicit such advice from State, tribal, and
local government officials, and foreign governments, as the President may deem necessary. The Secretary
shall seek responses within no more than 30 days from the date of a request.
(f) Upon receiving the views and assistance described in subsections (c), (d), and (e) of this section, the
Secretary of State shall consider whether additional information may be necessary in order for the President to
evaluate the application, and the Secretary shall advise the President accordingly. At the direction of the
President, the Secretary shall request any such additional information.
(g) If, at the conclusion of the actions set forth in subsections (b) through (f) of this section, the Secretary of
State is of the opinion that the issuance of a Presidential permit to the applicant, or the amendment of an
existing Presidential permit, would not serve the foreign policy interests of the United States, the Secretary
shall so advise the President, and provide the President with the reasons supporting that opinion, in writing.
[Release Point 118-106]
(h) If, at the conclusion of the actions set forth in subsections (b) through (f) of this section, the Secretary of
State is of the opinion that the issuance of a Presidential permit to the applicant, or the amendment of an
existing Presidential permit, would serve the foreign policy interests of the United States, the Secretary shall
so advise the President, and provide the President with the reasons supporting that opinion, in writing.
(i) Any decision to issue, deny, or amend a permit under this section shall be made solely by the President.
(j) The Secretary of State shall, consistent with applicable law, review the Department of State's regulations
and make any appropriate changes to them to ensure consistency with this order by no later than May 29,
2020.
(k) Executive Order 13337 of April 30, 2004 (Issuance of Permits With Respect to Certain Energy-Related
Facilities and Land Transportation Crossings on the International Boundaries of the United States) [formerly
set out above], and Executive Order 11423 of August 16, 1968 (Providing for the Performance of Certain
Functions Heretofore Performed by the President With Respect to Certain Facilities Constructed and
Maintained on the Borders of the United States), as amended [formerly set out above], are hereby revoked.
SEC. 3. Existing Permits. All permits heretofore issued pursuant to the orders enumerated in section 2(k) of
this order, and in force at the date of this order [Apr. 10, 2019], shall remain in full effect in accordance with
their terms unless and until modified, amended, suspended, or revoked by the appropriate authority.
SEC. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary,
administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of
appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural,
enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its
officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
