    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a high level of engagement in the Public Square and Congress channels, but the sentiment is mixed. The Executive channel is relatively quiet, suggesting caution or indecision at the leadership level. The limited activity in the States and News channels indicates a lack of immediate catalysts. Overall, Discord activity suggests a slightly negative market sentiment.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) far exceeds the Fed's target, leading to increased volatility. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates a recessionary environment, further dampening market confidence (35%). While unemployment (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate, it's not the primary driver of the current market conditions. The economic assessment points towards a bearish market.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to continued market uncertainty and downward pressure on stock prices. The low market confidence suggests that investors are hesitant to take on risk. Expect increased volatility and a cautious approach from institutional investors.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend Direction: Set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic downturn. Volatility: Increased to 1.10 due to high inflation and market uncertainty. Market Sentiment: Aligned with market confidence at 0.35. Momentum: Reduced to 0.15 to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-Term Outlook: Slightly decreased to 0.35 to account for the increased economic risks."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to persistent inflation and potential supply constraints. Expect continued high prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to slightly negative outlook. Consumer spending may decrease due to economic concerns.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative outlook due to potential interest rate hikes and economic slowdown. Expect increased volatility.",
    "HEALTH": "Relatively stable outlook. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook due to slowing economic growth and potential supply chain disruptions.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative outlook due to decreased consumer spending and inflationary pressures.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to slightly negative outlook. High growth stocks may be affected by rising interest rates.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral outlook. Transportation may be affected by slowing economic growth, but demand remains relatively stable."
