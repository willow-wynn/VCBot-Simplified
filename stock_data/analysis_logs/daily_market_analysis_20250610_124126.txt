    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows low engagement in Congress and News, with most activity in the Public Square. This indicates a lack of legislative action and market-moving news, contributing to market uncertainty. The 'coffin' reference in Public Square suggests a bearish sentiment.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth (stagflation) creates a challenging environment for businesses and consumers. Low unemployment is a positive, but it may contribute to wage-push inflation. The market is likely to react negatively to these conditions.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to the stagflationary environment. High volatility is expected. Long-term outlook is slightly pessimistic, but potential for recovery exists if inflation is controlled. Focus on defensive sectors and companies with strong balance sheets.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to high inflation. Market sentiment is low, reflecting low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to low unemployment. Long-term outlook is slightly below neutral, reflecting the uncertainty in the current economic climate."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Slightly positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints provide some support, but recessionary fears limit upside.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment is likely to decrease during economic downturns.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Banks face increased risk of loan defaults and reduced lending activity in a recessionary environment.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to slightly positive. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector, but faces pressure from rising costs.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing activity is likely to decline due to reduced business investment and consumer spending.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is expected to decline, especially on non-essential items. Discount retailers may outperform.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to slightly negative. Some tech companies may be resilient due to recurring revenue models, but overall growth is expected to slow.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Reduced economic activity leads to lower demand for transportation services."
