    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of concerns and attempts to address them. The 'no money??? Sad' comment reflects market anxiety, while mentions of 'Fixed' suggest attempts to stabilize the situation. High activity in Congress and Executive channels indicates policy discussions and potential interventions. News channel activity is moderate, suggesting a steady flow of information but no major shocks.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target of 2.0%, leading to increased volatility. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates a recessionary environment. Unemployment at 4.2% is slightly above the natural rate, adding to economic pressures. Market confidence is low at 35%, reflecting the overall economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish due to high inflation, negative GDP growth, and low market confidence. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic downturns, such as consumer discretionary and industrials, are likely to underperform. Defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples may offer some relative stability. Energy sector is volatile due to geopolitical factors.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative (-0.25) to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic downturn. Volatility is high (0.95) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to align with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly reduced (0.20) to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly adjusted downward (0.36) to account for the current economic challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Volatile due to geopolitical factors and fluctuating demand. Monitor supply chain disruptions and policy changes.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Under pressure due to reduced consumer spending and uncertainty in the entertainment industry.",
    "FINANCE": "Challenged by rising interest rates, potential loan defaults, and reduced investment activity.",
    "HEALTH": "Relatively stable as healthcare is a defensive sector, but faces cost pressures and regulatory scrutiny.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Weakened by supply chain disruptions, reduced demand, and rising input costs.",
    "RETAIL": "Struggling due to reduced consumer spending, high inflation, and supply chain issues. Focus on essential goods.",
    "TECH": "Vulnerable to reduced corporate spending and slower consumer demand for discretionary tech products.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Facing challenges due to high fuel costs, supply chain bottlenecks, and reduced demand for travel and shipping."
