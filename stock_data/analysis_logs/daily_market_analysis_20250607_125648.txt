    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows limited engagement in STATES and EXECUTIVE channels, suggesting a lack of confidence in government action. The PUBLIC_SQUARE and NEWS channels are active, indicating focus on political campaigns and news, which could drive short-term volatility. The CONGRESS channel shows some activity, but not enough to offset the negative sentiment.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) and negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicate stagflation. Unemployment (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low (35%), reflecting the overall uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Low market confidence further exacerbates the situation. Expect defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples to outperform, while growth stocks and cyclical sectors may struggle.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction is set to -0.25 to reflect the negative GDP growth and economic momentum. volatility is set to 0.85 to reflect the high inflation rate. market_sentiment is set to 0.35 to align with the low market confidence. momentum is set to 0.23, slightly lower than the base, to reflect the slowing economic growth. long_term_outlook is adjusted slightly to 0.36 to account for potential future improvements, but remains cautious."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Discretionary spending is likely to decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face challenges from potential interest rate hikes and a slowing economy.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Healthcare is a defensive sector and tends to perform well during economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral to Negative. Manufacturing is susceptible to economic slowdowns and decreased demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending may decline due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Negative. Growth stocks are likely to underperform in a high-inflation environment.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation may face challenges from decreased economic activity and supply chain disruptions."
