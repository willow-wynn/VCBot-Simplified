    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress and Executive channels, indicating focus on policy and potential market-moving decisions. The News channel highlights geopolitical risks (Iran) and White House turmoil, contributing to uncertainty. Public Square discussions are broad and less impactful. States channel is low volume and not impactful.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture: high inflation, negative GDP growth, and elevated unemployment. This stagflationary environment warrants a cautious market outlook. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major headwind. The negative GDP growth suggests a recessionary trend.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish due to the challenging economic conditions. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to decreased corporate earnings and investor risk aversion. Expect increased volatility and a downward trend in the short term. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles (e.g., Finance, Consumer Discretionary) are particularly vulnerable.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend Direction: Set to -0.35 to reflect negative GDP growth and economic momentum. Volatility: Increased to 1.15 due to high inflation and market uncertainty. Market Sentiment: Remains at 0.35, mirroring low market confidence. Momentum: Reduced to 0.15 to reflect slowing economic growth. Long-Term Outlook: Slightly decreased to 0.36 to acknowledge increased economic risks."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and geopolitical tensions support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items may decline in a recession.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and a slowing economy will pressure financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces cost pressures.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Sensitive to economic cycles; expect decreased demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Consumers may shift spending to necessities, impacting discretionary retail.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. High growth, but sensitive to interest rates and consumer spending.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Mixed outlook; depends on freight vs. passenger demand."
