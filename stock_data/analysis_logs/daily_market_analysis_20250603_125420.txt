    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of concerns and attempts at reassurance. The 'no money???' sentiment in Public Square reflects the economic anxiety. Discussions in Congress and Executive channels suggest efforts to address the situation, but the overall tone remains cautious. The high message volume in Congress indicates active debate but doesn't necessarily translate to positive market sentiment.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. The unemployment rate is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low, reflecting the uncertainty and pessimism surrounding the economy.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic conditions, the market outlook is bearish. The high inflation and negative GDP growth are likely to put downward pressure on stock prices. The low market confidence further exacerbates the situation. Expect continued volatility and a cautious approach from investors.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction is negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. market_sentiment aligns with the low market confidence. momentum is slightly positive, reflecting some hope for improvement. long_term_outlook is slightly reduced to account for the current economic challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation often benefits energy companies as prices rise. Expect continued demand and potentially higher profits for XOM, CVX, and COP.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment tends to decrease during economic downturns. DIS and NFLX may face challenges.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face increased risks during economic slowdowns. JPM, BAC, V, and GS may experience volatility and reduced profitability.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector, but PFE and UNH may still be affected by broader market trends.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing is sensitive to economic cycles. CAT and GE may face reduced demand due to the economic slowdown.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decline, impacting WMT, COST, and HD. Focus will be on essential goods.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies are vulnerable to economic downturns. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA may experience slower growth.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. LMT's defense contracts provide some stability, while BA's commercial aviation business may face headwinds."
