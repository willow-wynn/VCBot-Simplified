  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity indicates a focus on political and economic news, with a high volume of messages in the Congress channel. This suggests heightened awareness and concern about policy impacts on the market. The Executive office activity is low, indicating a lack of immediate policy changes. Public Square chatter reflects general market anxiety.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth suggests stagflation. The unemployment rate is low, but this might not be sustainable given the economic contraction. Market confidence is very low, reflecting the overall uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic data and market sentiment, a cautious outlook is warranted. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors that are more resilient to economic downturns, such as healthcare and consumer staples, may outperform. Energy sector could benefit from inflation. Growth stocks will likely underperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment is low, mirroring the confidence indicator. Momentum is slightly positive due to low unemployment but is offset by negative growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the increased risk."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. Inflation and potential supply constraints could drive energy prices higher.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending will likely decrease during economic downturn.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face increased risk of loan defaults and reduced lending activity.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing is sensitive to economic cycles and will suffer from reduced demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer staples may hold up better than discretionary retail.",
    "TECH": "Negative. High growth tech stocks are sensitive to interest rates and economic uncertainty.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation will be affected by decreased economic activity, but some segments may be more resilient than others."
