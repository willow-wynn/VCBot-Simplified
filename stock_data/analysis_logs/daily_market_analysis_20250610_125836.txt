  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows low engagement in Congress and News channels, suggesting a lack of immediate policy catalysts or market-moving events. The high volume in the Public Square indicates general market chatter but not necessarily informed trading decisions. Executive channel activity is minimal.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) coupled with negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates stagflation. Unemployment is low (3.2%) but approaching the natural rate, offering limited room for further improvement. Market confidence is very low at 35%.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to stagflation. High volatility is expected. Sectors with pricing power (Energy, Healthcare, Consumer Staples) may outperform, while growth-sensitive sectors (Tech, Financials) are likely to underperform. Long-term outlook remains uncertain, but leaning towards cautious optimism if inflation can be brought under control.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (1.10) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is aligned with the low market confidence (0.35). Momentum is slightly positive (0.25) due to the low unemployment rate, but tempered by the overall economic weakness. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced (0.407) from the base parameter, reflecting the current economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Outperform. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are favored.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Underperform. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decline in a stagflationary environment. DIS and NFLX face headwinds.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Underperform. Banks face increased regulatory scrutiny and potential loan losses due to economic slowdown. JPM, BAC, GS, and V are vulnerable.",
    "HEALTH": "Outperform. Healthcare is a defensive sector that tends to hold up well during economic downturns. JNJ, PFE, and UNH are relatively safe.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Underperform. Manufacturing is sensitive to economic cycles. CAT and GE may struggle.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral. Consumer staples (WMT, COST) may outperform discretionary retail (HD).",
    "TECH": "Underperform. High-growth tech stocks are sensitive to rising interest rates and economic uncertainty. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA face challenges.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Underperform. BA is exposed to economic slowdown and geopolitical risks."
