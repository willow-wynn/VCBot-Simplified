A BILL
Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States in
Americaassembled,
SECTION 1.TITLE.
This Actmaybe citedas the“Alternative IncomeTaxes ReformAct”.
SECTION 2.FINDINGS.
Congress findsthat—
(a) Thealternativeminimum isa floorfor taxation,calculatedbased uponanalternative
minimum taxableincome, whichingeneral, removesfromaccounting for some
deductions, whileapplying alesser taxrate,to computeanoverallalternative
effective taxrate.Individuals arethentaxed bycomparing theeffectivetax rates
between traditionalindividualincometaxes,and thealternative minimumtax.
(b) Asa resultof acombinationof specialinterestsand carelesslegislating,the
alternativeminimum taxnow placesthe taxburden uponthe middleclassrather than

thewealthy,with the effectivetax ratefor anindividualearning $175,000being
similarto theratefor anindividual earning$1,000,000.
(c) Underthis reform,everyone earningunder $295,440wouldseetheir taxesunderthe
alternativetaxable incomereduced,while everyoneearningabove thatamount would
see theirtaxesunder thealternative taxableincomeincreased.
(d) For anindividual inthe middle classbeingtaxed under thealternative minimumtax
with analternativetaxableincomeof $110,000,theirtaxeswouldbereduced byover
57%.
(e) Currently,capitalgain,such asthe saleofproperty orstocks,is taxedat alower rateif
it’sheldfor morethanayear.
(f) Asproperty sales andstockstradingareparticularly moreprevalent amongthose who
aremorewealthy,thisessentially turnsourtaxationinto beingregressive, where
someonetheoretically earning$300,000inlong-term capital gains wouldonlypayat
a taxrateof 15%, butmeanwhile, someonewhoearns halfthatat $150,000 wouldpay
a higher effectivetaxrateof 19.4%.
(g) Theconcentrationof long-term capitalgains is highlyfocusedonthe topquintileof
earners.Despitemaking up0.00028%of taxpayers, thetop400individuals inthe
UnitedStatesrealize 16%of capitalgains, Taxingtheseindividuals ata lowerrate
thanthose whoearnless,severely undermines theprogressivity ofthe incometax.
(h) There isaconsistently expressedinterestof Americantaxpayers favoring a
simplificationof thetax code,where anill understanding ofthis taxcode canlead to
disenfranchisement towardsgovernment,if notimpactfulmisguided personalfinance
decisionsthat furtherthe wealth gap.Thepreferentialtaxationof capitalgains
significantlycomplicates this taxcode.
(i) Thearbitrary differentiation between short-termand long-term capitalgains leadstoa
waste of resources asentities attemptto circumventtaxliabilities. Therehave been
attempts for decadestoeliminatethis circumventionof taxliabilities withoutreform
of thecapitalgainstax, andit hasbeen evidentthattheseattempts have been
ineffective.
(j) In 2012,Professor LeonardE. Burman presentedto theHouseCommittee onWays
and MeansandtheSenate CommitteeonFinance that from1950to2011,therehas
beena lowcorrelationat 0.12,between cutsin capitalgains taxesandeconomic
growth.
(k) Themergerof long-term capital gainsinto theconsideration ofandbeing taxed atthe
samerate asshort-term capitalgains andoverall income,whichreclaimsat least$90

billion in lostrevenue,with themajority ofthis tax burdenfalling uponthewealthy.
Some estimatesprojectanover $160billion increaseinrevenue.
