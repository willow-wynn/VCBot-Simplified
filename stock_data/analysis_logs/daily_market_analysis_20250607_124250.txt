  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political campaigns and news, suggesting some uncertainty and potential volatility in the market. The limited discussion in the Congress channel indicates a lack of immediate legislative action, which could lead to stagnation in certain sectors. The Executive channel's single message suggests limited executive intervention.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a challenging environment. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) necessitates a high volatility parameter. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) and a slightly elevated unemployment rate (4.2% vs. 3.5-4.0% natural rate) contribute to a negative trend direction. Low market confidence (35%) directly translates to a low market sentiment.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish due to the combination of high inflation, negative GDP growth, and low market confidence. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles, such as manufacturing and transportation, may underperform. Defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples might offer some stability.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and economic momentum. Volatility is set to 1.20 to account for the high inflation rate. Market sentiment is aligned with the market confidence level of 35%. Momentum is reduced to 0.10 due to the weak economic growth and slightly elevated unemployment. Long-term outlook is slightly adjusted to 0.35 to reflect the expectation of eventual economic recovery, but remaining cautious."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Neutral. High energy prices due to inflation, but potential for government intervention.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items likely to decrease due to inflation.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Higher interest rates may negatively impact lending and investment activity.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Defensive sector, less sensitive to economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Reduced demand due to economic slowdown.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral. Consumer staples may hold up, but discretionary retail will suffer.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Some tech companies may be resilient, but overall sector faces headwinds.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Reduced economic activity will decrease demand for transportation services."
