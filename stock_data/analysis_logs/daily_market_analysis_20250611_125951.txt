    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) necessitates aggressive monetary policy. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) signals a recession. Low market confidence (35%) reflects investor unease. Low unemployment (3.2%) is a bright spot but may not be sustainable.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to further declines. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to interest rates and consumer spending will be particularly vulnerable.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) due to the recessionary environment. Volatility is high (1.15) due to inflation uncertainty. Market sentiment is low (0.35) reflecting poor confidence. Momentum is slightly positive (0.25) due to the low unemployment rate, but overall economic conditions dominate. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced (0.41) to reflect increased economic risks."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to persistent inflation and supply constraints. Expect continued high energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook due to reduced consumer spending during the recession. Streaming services and discretionary entertainment will suffer.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative outlook due to rising interest rates and potential loan defaults. Banks and financial institutions will face headwinds.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral outlook. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces pressure from rising costs.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook due to reduced business investment and consumer demand. Durable goods manufacturing will be particularly affected.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative outlook due to reduced consumer spending and inflation impacting purchasing power. Discount retailers may outperform.",
    "TECH": "Negative outlook due to reduced business investment and consumer spending on discretionary tech products. Software and cloud services may be more resilient.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral outlook. Transportation faces mixed signals. Reduced consumer spending hurts demand, but supply chain issues persist."
