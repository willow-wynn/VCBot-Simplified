41.1. Purpose and Intent
41.1.1. This section aims to establish a framework for promoting
innovation, efficiency, and improved capability within the
public service while simultaneously enhancing the budgetary
position of the government. By incorporating a reasonable
productivity-based "efficiency dividend," this section seeks to
incentivize innovation, recognize performance improvements,
and foster a culture of continuous enhancement within
government agencies.
Page 86 / 88

41.2. Efficiency Dividend Implementation
41.2.1. CALCULATION METHODOLOGY— An efficiency dividend
shall be calculated based on a portion of the cost savings and
productivity gains achieved by government agencies. The
calculation methodology shall be standardized across all
agencies and shall take into account documented reductions in
operational costs, increased efficiency in service delivery, and
measurable enhancements in the quality of public services.
41.2.2. ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION— The efficiency
dividend funds shall be allocated and distributed to government
agencies based on their demonstrated performance
improvements. Agencies that achieve greater levels of efficiency
gains and innovation shall be eligible for a larger share of the
efficiency dividend pool.
41.2.3. REVIEW AND APPROVAL— The determination of efficiency
gains and the allocation of the dividend shall be reviewed and
approved by an independent oversight committee composed of
experts in economics, public administration, and innovation
management, appointed by and under the oversight of the
Secretary of the Treasury. This committee shall ensure the
integrity and fairness of the efficiency dividend calculation
process.
41.3. Incentives for Innovation
41.3.1. INNOVATION RECOGNITION— A portion of the efficiency
dividend funds shall be reserved to recognize and reward
government agencies that demonstrate exceptional innovation
in their processes, services, or projects. This recognition may
include awards, commendations, or financial incentives.
41.3.2. INNOVATION INVESTMENT— A designated portion of the
efficiency dividend funds shall be set aside as an "Innovation
Fund" to support and finance innovation initiatives proposed by
government agencies. Agencies may submit proposals for
projects that have the potential to substantially enhance service
delivery, streamline processes, or address pressing public needs.
41.3.3. INNOVATION OVERSIGHT— The allocation and utilization of
the Innovation Fund shall be overseen by an innovation board
composed of experts in various fields, including technology,
public policy, and entrepreneurship. The board shall evaluate
proposed projects based on their potential impact, feasibility,
Page 87 / 88

and alignment with broader government objectives.
41.4. Reporting and Transparency
41.4.1. ANNUAL REPORTING— Government agencies shall submit
annual reports detailing their efficiency gains, innovation
efforts, and the utilization of efficiency dividend funds. These
reports shall provide transparency and accountability in
demonstrating how productivity improvements have translated
into tangible benefits for the public and the government's
budgetary position.
41.4.2. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE— A summary of the annual reports and
a breakdown of the distribution of efficiency dividend funds
shall be made publicly accessible through government websites.
This transparency shall promote public awareness of the
government's efforts to enhance efficiency and innovation.
41.5. Continuous Improvement and Evaluation
41.5.1. PERIODIC REVIEW— The efficiency dividend framework and
its impact on innovation and government efficiency shall be
subject to periodic review by an independent evaluation
commission. The commission shall assess the effectiveness of
the program, identify areas for improvement, and recommend
adjustments as needed.
41.5.2. ADJUSTMENTS AND AMENDMENTS— Based on the
recommendations of the evaluation commission, Congress shall
have the authority to make adjustments or amendments to the
efficiency dividend framework to ensure its ongoing relevance
and alignment with evolving government priorities.
42. SECTION 42. SEVERABILITY.
42.1. Severability. — Should any one or more provision, section,
subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, word, application of this
Act be deemed invalid or unconstitutional for any reason in a
court with relevant jurisdiction, the rest of the Act, and the
application of the remaining provisions, shall not be affected.
