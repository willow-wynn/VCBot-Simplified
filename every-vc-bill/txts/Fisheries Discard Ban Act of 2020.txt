IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES
MAY 20, 2020
Mr. CARTON (for himself, Mr. MITCHELL, Mr. RADCLIFFE)
introduced the following bill;
A BILL
To amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to outlaw
the discarding of bycatches for high seas fisheries, or fisheries governed by international
fishery management agreements.
Be it enacted by the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress
Assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This bill may be cited as the “Fisheries Discard Ban Act of 2020”.
SECTION 2. CHANGES IN FINDINGS.
(a) NEED FOR A LANDING OBLIGATION.— Section 2(a) (16 U.S.C. 1801(a)) is amended by
adding at the end the following:
“(14) The practice of economic discards and regulatory discards leads to an important
number of fishes being returned to the sea immediately after being catched. These catches
are not accounted for, cannot be counted against the existing total allowable catches, and are
often returned dead, effectively impacting stocks. The practice makes it harder for scientists

to determine precisely the impact of fishing activities on all stocks. Therefore, a landing
obligation should be adopted to ensure better measurement of the impact of fishing on all
total allowable catches, and better long-term stock management.”
SECTION 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF A LANDING OBLIGATION.
Title III (16 U.S.C. 1851 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:
“SEC. 321. LANDING OBLIGATION. (16 U.S.C. 1870)
(a) LANDING OBLIGATION. All quantities of fish from a fishery which is subject to a
total allowable catch shall be brought and retained on board the fishing vessels,
recorded, landed and counted against the total allowable catch.
(b) INTERNATIONAL TREATIES. The landing obligation under paragraph (a) is without
prejudice to the United States’ international obligations and commitments under
existing Treaties.
(c) MINIMUM SIZE. Councils may establish minimum reference sizes, below which a fish
is regarded as juvenile. The catches of species below the applicable minimum reference
size shall not be subject to the landing obligation under paragraph (a), but shall instead
immediately be returned to the sea.”
SECTION 4. ENACTMENT.
This Act shall be enacted 30 days after its passing.
