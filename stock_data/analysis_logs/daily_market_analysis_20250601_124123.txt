    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress, suggesting potential for policy-driven market movements. Public sentiment seems mixed, with some celebrating wins, but overall, the lack of focused discussion suggests uncertainty. Executive actions could create short-term volatility.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture: high inflation, negative GDP growth, and unemployment slightly above the natural rate. This stagflationary environment warrants caution. The market is likely to react negatively to the GDP data and inflation figures.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic headwinds and low market confidence, a bearish short-term outlook is appropriate. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on prices. Long-term, the market's outlook remains uncertain, contingent on the Fed's actions and potential fiscal policy changes.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to GDP decline. Volatility is high due to inflation. Market sentiment reflects low confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting the slightly elevated unemployment. Long-term outlook is adjusted slightly downward to reflect overall uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector (XOM, CVX, COP) is expected to perform relatively well due to persistent inflation and supply constraints. A slight positive outlook is warranted.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment (NFLX, DIS, EA) faces headwinds from consumer spending cuts due to inflation. A slightly negative outlook is appropriate.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector (JPM, BAC, V, GS, BRK.B) is vulnerable to economic slowdown and potential interest rate hikes. A negative outlook is justified.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare (JNJ, UNH, PFE) is generally more resilient to economic downturns, but faces regulatory risks. A neutral to slightly positive outlook is reasonable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing (CAT, GE, LMT) is sensitive to economic cycles and faces supply chain challenges. A negative outlook is warranted.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail (WMT, COST, HD) faces challenges from inflation and changing consumer behavior. A slightly negative outlook is appropriate.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA) is highly valued and sensitive to interest rate changes. A negative outlook is justified.",
    "TRANSPORT": "The transport sector (BA) is facing headwinds due to manufacturing and supply chain issues. A negative outlook is warranted."
