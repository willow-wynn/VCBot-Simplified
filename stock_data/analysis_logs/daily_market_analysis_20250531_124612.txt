    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of political commentary and general discussion, with limited direct impact on specific stocks. The high volume in Public Square suggests some general market anxiety, while the Executive and Congress channels indicate ongoing policy discussions. This contributes to overall market uncertainty.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation, negative GDP growth, and elevated unemployment (above the natural rate) all contribute to a bearish outlook. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major concern. The negative GDP growth indicates a potential recession.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish due to the combination of high inflation, negative GDP growth, and low market confidence. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Energy sector may show relative strength due to inflationary pressures. Defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples may also outperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, aligning with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting some underlying economic activity. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform relatively well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decrease in a recessionary environment. DIS and NFLX face headwinds.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face challenges from rising interest rates and potential loan losses. JPM, BAC, and GS are vulnerable.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is a defensive sector and may outperform in a downturn. JNJ, PFE, and UNH are expected to be relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing is sensitive to economic cycles and will likely suffer in a recession. CAT and GE face challenges.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending is under pressure from inflation. WMT and COST may hold up better than other retailers due to their focus on essential goods.",
    "TECH": "Negative. Tech stocks are generally overvalued and sensitive to interest rate hikes. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA face significant downside risk.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Transportation is closely tied to economic activity and will suffer in a recession. BA and LMT face headwinds."
