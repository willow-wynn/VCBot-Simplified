    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress and Executive branches, indicating potential policy shifts. Public Square discussions on campaigns suggest focus on specific regions, potentially impacting localized sectors. The vetoed American Symbols Act suggests political gridlock, contributing to market uncertainty.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth signals stagflation. High unemployment adds to the negative outlook. The market confidence is very low. This warrants a cautious approach with a bias towards defensive sectors.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment, the market is expected to be volatile with a downward trend. Defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples may outperform, while cyclical sectors like financials and industrials may underperform. High inflation will pressure corporate earnings.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment is low, reflecting poor market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting the slightly above natural rate unemployment. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic challenges."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector is expected to perform relatively well due to persistent inflation and supply constraints. Focus on established players like XOM and CVX.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector faces headwinds due to discretionary spending cuts amid inflation. DIS and NFLX may struggle.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector is vulnerable to economic slowdown and potential interest rate hikes. JPM, BAC, and GS face increased risk.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector is expected to be a safe haven due to its defensive nature. JNJ and UNH are likely to outperform.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is exposed to economic downturn and reduced capital spending. CAT and GE may face challenges.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector is mixed. Discount retailers like WMT and COST may benefit from consumers seeking value, while HD may suffer from reduced home improvement spending.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector is highly sensitive to interest rate hikes and economic slowdown. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA face increased volatility.",
    "TRANSPORT": "The transportation sector is expected to struggle due to decreased demand and high fuel costs. BA will likely underperform."
