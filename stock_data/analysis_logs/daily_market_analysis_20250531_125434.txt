    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish due to the stagflationary environment. High inflation will likely lead to further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which could further dampen economic growth. Low market confidence suggests investors are risk-averse. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative to reflect negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting some underlying economic activity. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic challenges."

    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces cost pressures.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Slowing economic growth and rising input costs will hurt manufacturing.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Inflation and reduced consumer spending will negatively impact retail.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies face slowing growth and increased regulatory scrutiny.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation is affected by both energy prices and overall economic activity."
