(a) Findings.—Congress findsthat—
(1) in responsetoafinancialcrisis andthe ensuing GreatDepression,Congress
enacted theBankingActof 1933,knownas the“Glass-Steagall Act”, toprohibit
commercialbanksfromoffering investment bankingand insuranceservices;
(2) a seriesof deregulatory decisionsbythe Boardof Governorsofthe FederalReserve
System andtheOffice ofthe Comptroller ofthe Currency,in additiontodecisionsby
Federal courts,permitted commercialbanks toengage inanincreasingnumberof risky
financialactivities thathadpreviously beenrestricted under theGlass-Steagall Act,andalso
vastlyexpanded themeaningof the“business ofbanking” and“closely related activities”in
bankinglaw;
(3) in 1999,Congressenactedthe “Gramm-Leach-BlileyAct”, whichrepealed the
Glass-SteagallAct separation between commercialandinvestment banking andallowed for
complexcross-subsidiesand interconnectionsbetween commercial andinvestment banks;

(3.5) Byreviving thesovereignty of retailsbanks,the lawmade investmentbanks
searchfor another sourceof fundsseparatefrom depositors'accounts.
(4) with theelimination ofGlass-Steagall, thelargest institutions withthe greatest
ability toleverage their balancesheetsincreasedtheirriskprofile bygettinginto trading,
marketmaking, andhedgefund activities,addingevergreatercomplexity totheirbalance
sheets.”And theensuing 2008-Reccesion.Which ledto failureofthe housingmarket, stock

increasingthedominance ofa fewlarge,complexfinancialinstitutionsthat aregenerally
