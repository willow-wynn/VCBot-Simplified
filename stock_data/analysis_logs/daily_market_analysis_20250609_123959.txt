    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress, suggesting potential policy changes. Executive activity is low, indicating stability or lack of immediate action. Public Square discussions seem focused on governance, which could influence market sentiment. News mentions a political campaign, which may add uncertainty.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth suggests stagflation. Low market confidence and high unemployment further exacerbate the situation. The Fed's target inflation rate is far from being met, and the economy is contracting.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic data, a bearish market outlook is warranted. High volatility and negative trend direction indicate potential for further market decline. Low market sentiment and weak momentum reinforce this view. Sectors sensitive to economic downturns, such as entertainment and transport, are likely to underperform. Energy may see some support due to inflation.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic momentum. Volatility is set to 1.15 to account for the high inflation rate. Market sentiment is set to 0.35 to align with the low market confidence. Momentum is set to 0.25 to reflect the weak economic growth and employment trends. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.41 to reflect the current economic challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive: High inflation provides support, but overall economic weakness limits gains.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative: Consumer spending is likely to decrease during economic downturns.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral: Banks may face challenges due to potential loan defaults and interest rate hikes.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral: Relatively stable, but healthcare spending could be affected by economic conditions.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative: Sensitive to economic cycles, likely to decline with GDP growth.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative: Consumer spending is likely to decrease during economic downturns.",
    "TECH": "Neutral: Some tech companies may be resilient, but overall sector growth is expected to slow.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative: Affected by decreased economic activity and consumer spending."
