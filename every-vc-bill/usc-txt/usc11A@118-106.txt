CONGRESS
Sections 2 to 4 of the Order of the Supreme Court, dated Apr. 25, 1983, provided:
"2. That the aforementioned Bankruptcy Rules shall take effect on August 1, 1983, and shall be applicable
to proceedings then pending, except to the extent that in the opinion of the court their application in a pending
proceeding would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which event the former procedure applies.

the new rules, effective August 1, 1983.
"4. That the Chief Justice be, and he hereby is, authorized to transmit these new Bankruptcy Rules to the
Congress in accordance with the provisions of Section 2075 of Title 28, United States Code."
[Release Point 118-106]
Rule 1001. Scope of Rules and Forms; Short Title
The Bankruptcy Rules and Forms govern procedure in cases under title 11 of the United States
Code. The rules shall be cited as the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and the forms as the
Official Bankruptcy Forms. These rules shall be construed, administered, and employed by the court
and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every case and
proceeding.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 27, 2017, eff.
Dec. 1, 2017.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Section 247 of Public Law 95–598, 92 Stat. 2549 amended 28 U.S.C. §2075 by omitting the last sentence.
The effect of the amendment is to require that procedural rules promulgated pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2075 be
consistent with the bankruptcy statute, both titles 11 and 28 U.S.C. Thus, although Rule 1001 sets forth the
scope of the bankruptcy rules and forms, any procedural matters contained in title 11 or 28 U.S.C. with respect
to cases filed under 11 U.S.C. would control. See 1 Collier, Bankruptcy 3.04 [2][c] (15th ed. 1980).
28 U.S.C. §151 establishes a United States Bankruptcy Court in each district as an adjunct to the district
court. This provision does not, however, become effective until April 1, 1984. Public Law 95–598, §402(b).
From October 1, 1979 through March 31, 1984, the courts of bankruptcy as defined in §1(10) of the
Bankruptcy Act, and created in §2a of that Act continue to be the courts of bankruptcy. Public Law 95–598,
§404(a). From their effective date these rules and forms are to be applicable in cases filed under chapters 7, 9,
11 and 13 of title 11 regardless of whether the court is established by the Bankruptcy Act or by 28 U.S.C.
§151. Rule 9001 contains a broad and general definition of "bankruptcy court," "court" and "United States
Bankruptcy Court" for this purpose.
"Bankruptcy Code" or "Code" as used in these rules means title 11 of the United States Code, the
codification of the bankruptcy law. Public Law 95–598, §101. See Rule 9001.
"Bankruptcy Act" as used in the notes to these rules means the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 as amended which
was repealed by §401(a) of Public Law 95–598.
These rules apply to all cases filed under the Code except as otherwise specifically stated.
The final sentence of the rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 903. The objective of "expeditious
and economical administration" of cases under the Code has frequently been recognized by the courts to be "a
chief purpose of the bankruptcy laws." See Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 328 (1966): Bailey v. Glover, 88
U.S. (21 Wall.) 342, 346–47 (1874): Ex parte Christy, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 292, 312–14, 320–22 (1845). The
rule also incorporates the wholesome mandate of the last sentence of Rule 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. 2 Moore, Federal Practice 1.13 (2d ed. 1980); 4 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and
Procedure-Civil §1029 (1969).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Title I of the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98–353, 98 Stat.
333 (hereinafter the 1984 amendments), created a new bankruptcy judicial system in which the role of the
district court was substantially increased. 28 U.S.C. §1334 confers on the United States district courts original
and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases under title 11 of the United States Code and original but not exclusive
jurisdiction over civil proceedings arising under title 11 and civil proceedings arising in or related to a case
under title 11.
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §157(a) the district court may but need not refer cases and proceedings within the
district court's jurisdiction to the bankruptcy judges for the district. Judgments or orders of the bankruptcy
judges entered pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §157(b)(1) and (c)(2) are subject to appellate review by the district
courts or bankruptcy appellate panels under 28 U.S.C. §158(a).
Rule 81(a)(1) F.R.Civ.P. provides that the civil rules do not apply to proceedings in bankruptcy, except as
they may be made applicable by rules promulgated by the Supreme Court, e.g., Part VII of these rules. This
amended Bankruptcy Rule 1001 makes the Bankruptcy Rules applicable to cases and proceedings under title
11, whether before the district judges or the bankruptcy judges of the district.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The citation to these rules is amended to conform to the citation form of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2017 AMENDMENT
[Release Point 118-106]
The last sentence of the rule is amended to incorporate the changes to Rule 1 F.R.Civ.P. made in 1993 and
2015.
The word "administered" is added to recognize the affirmative duty of the court to exercise the authority
conferred by these rules to ensure that bankruptcy cases and the proceedings within them are resolved not only
fairly, but also without undue cost or delay. As officers of the court, attorneys share this responsibility with
the judge to whom the case is assigned.
The addition of the phrase "employed by the court and the parties" emphasizes that parties share in the duty
of using the rules to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every case and proceeding.
Achievement of this goal depends upon cooperative and proportional use of procedure by lawyers and parties.
This amendment does not create a new or independent source of sanctions. Nor does it abridge the scope of
any other of these rules.
PART I—COMMENCEMENT OF CASE; PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO
PETITION AND ORDER FOR RELIEF
Rule 1002. Commencement of Case
(a) PETITION. A petition commencing a case under the Code shall be filed with the clerk.
(b) TRANSMISSION TO UNITED STATES TRUSTEE. The clerk shall forthwith transmit to the
United States trustee a copy of the petition filed pursuant to subdivision (a) of this rule.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Under §§301–303 of the Code, a voluntary or involuntary case is commenced by filing a petition with the
bankruptcy court. The voluntary petition may request relief under chapter 7, 9, 11, or 13 whereas an
involuntary petition may be filed only under chapter 7 or 11. Section 109 of the Code specifies the types of
debtors for whom the different forms of relief are available and §303(a) indicates the persons against whom
involuntary petitions may be filed.
The rule in subdivision (a) is in harmony with the Code in that it requires the filing to be with the
bankruptcy court.
The number of copies of the petition to be filed is specified in this rule but a local rule may require
additional copies. This rule provides for filing sufficient copies for the court's files and for the trustee in a
chapter 7 or 13 case.
Official Form No. 1 may be used to seek relief voluntarily under any of the chapters. Only the original need
be signed and verified, but the copies must be conformed to the original. See Rules 1008 and 9011(c). As
provided in §362(a) of the Code, the filing of a petition acts as a stay of certain acts and proceedings against
the debtor, property of the debtor, and property of the estate.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Rules 1002(a), governing a voluntary petition, 1003(a), governing an involuntary petition, and 1003(e),
governing a petition in a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding, are combined into this Rule 1002. If a
bankruptcy clerk has been appointed for the district, the petition is filed with the bankruptcy clerk. Otherwise,
the petition is filed with the clerk of the district court.
The elimination of the reference to the Official Forms of the petition is not intended to change the practice.
Rule 9009 provides that the Official Forms "shall be observed and used" in cases and proceedings under the
Code.
Subdivision (b) which provided for the distribution of copies of the petition to agencies of the United States
has been deleted. Some of these agencies no longer wish to receive copies of the petition, while others not
included in subdivision (b) have now requested copies. The Director of the Administrative Office will
determine on an ongoing basis which government agencies will be provided a copy of the petition.
The number of copies of a petition that must be filed is a matter for local rule.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is derived from Rule X–1002(a). The duties of the United States trustee pursuant to the
Code and 28 U.S.C. §586(a) require that the United States trustee be apprised of the commencement of every
[Release Point 118-106]
case under chapters 7, 11, 12 and 13 and this is most easily accomplished by providing that office with a copy
of the petition. Although 28 U.S.C. §586(a) does not give the United States trustee an administrative role in
chapter 9 cases, §1102 of the Code requires the United States trustee to appoint committees and that section is
applicable in chapter 9 cases pursuant to §901(a). It is therefore appropriate that the United States trustee
receive a copy of every chapter 9 petition.
Notwithstanding subdivision (b), pursuant to Rule 5005(b)(3), the clerk is not required to transmit a copy of
the petition to the United States trustee if the United States trustee requests that it not be transmitted. Many
rules require the clerk to transmit a certain document to the United States trustee, but Rule 5005(b)(3) relieves
the clerk of that duty under this or any other rule if the United States trustee requests that such document not
be transmitted.
Rule 1003. Involuntary Petition
(a) TRANSFEROR OR TRANSFEREE OF CLAIM. A transferor or transferee of a claim shall
annex to the original and each copy of the petition a copy of all documents evidencing the transfer,
whether transferred unconditionally, for security, or otherwise, and a signed statement that the claim
was not transferred for the purpose of commencing the case and setting forth the consideration for
and terms of the transfer. An entity that has transferred or acquired a claim for the purpose of
commencing a case for liquidation under chapter 7 or for reorganization under chapter 11 shall not
be a qualified petitioner.
(b) JOINDER OF PETITIONERS AFTER FILING. If the answer to an involuntary petition filed
by fewer than three creditors avers the existence of 12 or more creditors, the debtor shall file with the
answer a list of all creditors with their addresses, a brief statement of the nature of their claims, and
the amounts thereof. If it appears that there are 12 or more creditors as provided in §303(b) of the
Code, the court shall afford a reasonable opportunity for other creditors to join in the petition before
a hearing is held thereon.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a). Official Form No. 11 (Involuntary Case: Creditors' Petition), is prescribed for use by
petitioning creditors to have a debtor's assets liquidated under chapter 7 of the Code or the business
reorganized under chapter 11. It contains the required allegations as specified in §303(b) of the Code. Official
Form 12 is prescribed for use by fewer than all the general partners to obtain relief for the partnership as
governed by §303(b)(3) of the Code and Rule 1004(b).
Although the number of copies to be filed is specified in Rule 1002, a local rule may require additional
copies.
Only the original need be signed and verified, but the copies must be conformed to the original. See Rules
1008 and 9011(c). The petition must be filed with the bankruptcy court. This provision implements §303(b)
which provides that an involuntary case is commenced by filing the petition with the court.
As provided in §362 of the Code, the filing of the petition acts as a stay of certain acts and proceedings
against the debtor, the debtor's property and property of the estate.
Subdivision (c) retains the explicitness of former Bankruptcy Rule 104(d) that a transfer of a claim for the
purpose of commencing a case under the Code is a ground for disqualification of a party to the transfer as a
petitioner.
Section 303(b) "is not intended to overrule Bankruptcy Rule 104(d), which places certain restrictions on the
transfer of claims for the purpose of commencing an involuntary case." House Report No. 95–595, 95th
Cong., 1st Sess. (1977) 322; Senate Report No. 95–989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978) 33.
The subdivision requires disclosure of any transfer of the petitioner's claim as well as a transfer to the
petitioner and applies to transfers for security as well as unconditional transfers, Cf. In re 69th & Crandon
Bldg. Corp., 97 F.2d 392, 395 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 305 U.S. 629 (1938), recognizing the right of a creditor
to sign a bankruptcy petition notwithstanding a prior assignment of his claim for the purpose of security. This
rule does not, however, qualify the requirement of §303(b)(1) that a petitioning creditor must have a claim not
contingent as to liability.
Subdivision (d). Section 303(c) of the Code permits a creditor to join in the petition at any time before the
case is dismissed or relief is ordered. While this rule does not require the court to give all creditors notice of
the petition, the list of creditors filed by the debtor affords a petitioner the information needed to enable him to
[Release Point 118-106]
give notice for the purpose of obtaining the co-petitioners required to make the petition sufficient. After a
reasonable opportunity has been afforded other creditors to join in an involuntary petition, the hearing on the
petition should be held without further delay.
Subdivision (e). This subdivision implements §304. A petition for relief under §304 may only be filed by a
foreign representative who is defined in §101(20) generally as a representative of an estate in a foreign
proceeding. The term "foreign proceeding" is defined in §101(19).
Section 304(b) permits a petition filed thereunder to be contested by a party in interest. Subdivision (e)(2)
therefore requires that the summons and petition be served on any person against whom the relief permitted by
§304(b) is sought as well as on any other party the court may direct.
The rules applicable to the procedure when an involuntary petition is filed are made applicable generally
when a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding is commenced. These rules include Rule 1010 with respect to
issuance and service of a summons, Rule 1011 concerning responsive pleadings and motions, and Rule 1018
which makes various rules in Part VII applicable in proceedings on contested petitions.
The venue for a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding is provided in 28 U.S.C. §1474.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
The subject matter of subdivisions (a), (b), and (e) has been incorporated in Rules 1002, 1010, 1011, and
1018.
Rule 1004. Involuntary Petition Against a Partnership
After filing of an involuntary petition under §303(b)(3) of the Code, (1) the petitioning partners or
other petitioners shall promptly send to or serve on each general partner who is not a petitioner a
copy of the petition; and (2) the clerk shall promptly issue a summons for service on each general
partner who is not a petitioner. Rule 1010 applies to the form and service of the summons.
(As amended Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 105 and complements §§301 and 303(b)(3) of the Code.
Subdivision (a) specifies that while all general partners must consent to the filing of a voluntary petition, it
is not necessary that they all execute the petition. It may be executed and filed on behalf of the partnership by
fewer than all.
Subdivision (b) implements §303(b)(3) of the Code which provides that an involuntary petition may be filed
by fewer than all the general partners or, when all the general partners are debtors, by a general partner, trustee
of the partner or creditors of the partnership. Rule 1010, which governs service of a petition and summons in
an involuntary case, specifies the time and mode of service on the partnership. When a petition is filed against
a partnership under §303(b)(3), this rule requires an additional service on the nonfiling general partners. It is
the purpose of this subdivision to protect the interests of the nonpetitioning partners and the partnership.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2002 AMENDMENT
Section 303(b)(3)(A) of the Code provides that fewer than all of the general partners in a partnership may
commence an involuntary case against the partnership. There is no counterpart provision in the Code setting
out the manner in which a partnership commences a voluntary case. The Supreme Court has held in the
corporate context that applicable nonbankruptcy law determines whether authority exists for a particular
debtor to commence a bankruptcy case. See Price v. Gurney, 324 U.S. 100 (1945). The lower courts have
followed this rule in the partnership context as well. See, e.g., Jolly v. Pittore, 170 B.R. 793 (S.D.N.Y. 1994);
Union Planters National Bank v. Hunters Horn Associates, 158 B.R. 729 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1993); In re
Channel 64 Joint Venture, 61 B.R. 255 (Bankr. S.D. Oh. 1986). Rule 1004(a) could be construed as requiring
the consent of all of the general partners to the filing of a voluntary petition, even if fewer than all of the
general partners would have the authority under applicable nonbankruptcy law to commence a bankruptcy
case for the partnership. Since this is a matter of substantive law beyond the scope of these rules, Rule 1004(a)
is deleted as is the designation of subdivision (b).
The rule is retitled to reflect that it applies only to involuntary petitions filed against partnerships.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes since publication.

Rule 1004.1. Petition for an Infant or Incompetent Person
If an infant or incompetent person has a representative, including a general guardian, committee,
conservator, or similar fiduciary, the representative may file a voluntary petition on behalf of the
infant or incompetent person. An infant or incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed
representative may file a voluntary petition by next friend or guardian ad litem. The court shall
appoint a guardian ad litem for an infant or incompetent person who is a debtor and is not otherwise
represented or shall make any other order to protect the infant or incompetent debtor.
(Added Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2002
This rule is derived from Rule 17(c) F.R. Civ. P. It does not address the commencement of a case filed on
behalf of a missing person. See, e.g., In re King, 234 B.R. 515 (Bankr. D.N.M. 1999)
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made.
Rule 1004.2. Petition in Chapter 15 Cases
(a) DESIGNATING CENTER OF MAIN INTERESTS. A petition for recognition of a foreign
proceeding under chapter 15 of the Code shall state the country where the debtor has its center of
main interests. The petition shall also identify each country in which a foreign proceeding by,
regarding, or against the debtor is pending.
(b) CHALLENGING DESIGNATION. The United States trustee or a party in interest may file a
motion for a determination that the debtor's center of main interests is other than as stated in the
petition for recognition commencing the chapter 15 case. Unless the court orders otherwise, the
motion shall be filed no later than seven days before the date set for the hearing on the petition. The
motion shall be transmitted to the United States trustee and served on the debtor, all persons or
bodies authorized to administer foreign proceedings of the debtor, all entities against whom
provisional relief is being sought under §1519 of the Code, all parties to litigation pending in the
United States in which the debtor was a party as of the time the petition was filed, and such other
entities as the court may direct.
(Added Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2011
This rule is new. Subdivision (a) directs any entity that files a petition for recognition of a foreign
proceeding under chapter 15 of the Code to state in the petition the center of the debtor's main interests. The
petition must also list each country in which a foreign proceeding involving the debtor is pending. This
information will assist the court and parties in interest in determining whether the foreign proceeding is a
foreign main or nonmain proceeding.
Subdivision (b) sets a deadline of seven days prior to the hearing on the petition for recognition for filing a
motion challenging the statement in the petition regarding the country in which the debtor's center of main
interests is located.
Changes Made After Publication. The rule was first published for comment in August 2008. After
publication, the deadline in subdivision (b) for challenging the designation of the center of the debtor's main
interests was changed from "60 days after the notice of the petition has been given" to "no later than seven
days before the date set for the hearing on the petition."
The rule as revised was published in August 2009. Minor stylistic changes were made to the rule's language
and the Committee Note following that publication.
No comments were submitted on proposed Rule 1004.2 after its republication in August 2009.
Rule 1005. Caption of Petition
The caption of a petition commencing a case under the Code shall contain the name of the court,
the title of the case, and the docket number. The title of the case shall include the following
information about the debtor: name, employer identification number, last four digits of the
[Release Point 118-106]
social-security number or individual debtor's taxpayer-identification number, any other federal
taxpayer-identification number, and all other names used within eight years before filing the petition.
If the petition is not filed by the debtor, it shall include all names used by the debtor which are
known to the petitioners.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Mar. 27, 2003, eff. Dec. 1, 2003; Apr. 23, 2008, eff.
Dec. 1, 2008.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
The title of the case should include all names used by the debtor, such as trade names, former married
names and maiden name. See also Official Form No. 1 and the Advisory Committee Note to that Form.
Additional names of the debtor are also required to appear in the caption of each notice to creditors. See Rule
2002(m).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2003 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement the Judicial Conference policy to limit the disclosure of a party's social
security number and similar identifiers. Under the rule, as amended, only the last four digits of the debtor's
social security number need be disclosed. Publication of the employer identification number does not present
the same identity theft or privacy protection issues. Therefore, the caption must include the full employer
identification number.
Debtors must submit with the petition a statement setting out their social security numbers. This enables the
clerk to include the full social security number on the notice of the section 341 meeting of creditors, but the
statement itself is not submitted in the case or maintained in the case file.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The rule was changed only slightly after publication. The
rule was changed to make clear that only the debtor's social security number is truncated to the final four
digits, but other numerical identifiers must be set out in full. The rule also was amended to include a
requirement that a debtor list other federal taxpayer identification numbers that may be in use.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to require the disclosure of all names used by the debtor in the past eight years. Section
727(a)(8) was amended in 2005 to extend the time between chapter 7 discharges from six to eight years, and
the rule is amended to implement that change. The rule also is amended to require the disclosure of the last
four digits of an individual debtor's taxpayer-identification number. This truncation of the number applies only
to individual debtors. This is consistent with the requirements of Rule 9037.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
Rule 1006. Filing Fee
(a) GENERAL REQUIREMENT. Every petition shall be accompanied by the filing fee except as
provided in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this rule. For the purpose of this rule, "filing fee" means the
filing fee prescribed by 28 U.S.C. §1930(a)(1)–(a)(5) and any other fee prescribed by the Judicial
Conference of the United States under 28 U.S.C. §1930(b) that is payable to the clerk upon the
commencement of a case under the Code.
(b) PAYMENT OF FILING FEE IN INSTALLMENTS.
(1) Application to Pay Filing Fee in Installments. A voluntary petition by an individual shall be
accepted for filing, regardless of whether any portion of the filing fee is paid, if accompanied by
the debtor's signed application, prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form, stating
that the debtor is unable to pay the filing fee except in installments.
(2) Action on Application. Prior to the meeting of creditors, the court may order the filing fee
paid to the clerk or grant leave to pay in installments and fix the number, amount and dates of
payment. The number of installments shall not exceed four, and the final installment shall be
payable not later than 120 days after filing the petition. For cause shown, the court may extend the
time of any installment, provided the last installment is paid not later than 180 days after filing the
petition.
(3) Postponement of Attorney's Fees. All installments of the filing fee must be paid in full
before the debtor or chapter 13 trustee may make further payments to an attorney or any other
[Release Point 118-106]
person who renders services to the debtor in connection with the case.
(c) WAIVER OF FILING FEE. A voluntary chapter 7 petition filed by an individual shall be
accepted for filing if accompanied by the debtor's application requesting a waiver under 28 U.S.C.
§1930(f), prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 23, 1996, eff. Dec. 1, 1996; Apr. 23, 2008, eff.
Dec. 1, 2008; Apr. 27, 2017, eff. Dec. 1, 2017.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
28 U.S.C. §1930 specifies the filing fees for petitions under chapters 7, 9, 11 and 13 of the Code. It also
permits the payment in installments by individual debtors.
Subdivision (b) is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 107. The administrative cost of installments in
excess of four is disproportionate to the benefits conferred. Prolonging the period beyond 180 days after the
commencement of the case causes undesirable delays in administration. Paragraph (2) accordingly continues
the imposition of a maximum of four on the number of installments and retains the maximum period of
installment payments allowable on an original application at 120 days. Only in extraordinary cases should it
be necessary to give an applicant an extension beyond the four months. The requirement of paragraph (3) that
filing fees be paid in full before the debtor may pay an attorney for services in connection with the case
codifies the rule declared in In re Latham, 271 Fed. 538 (N.D.N.Y. 1921), and In re Darr, 232 Fed. 415 (N.D.
Cal. 1916).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b)(3) is expanded to prohibit payments by the debtor or the chapter 13 trustee not only to
attorneys but to any person who renders services to the debtor in connection with the case.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1996 AMENDMENT
The Judicial Conference prescribes miscellaneous fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1930(b). In 1992, a $30
miscellaneous administrative fee was prescribed for all chapter 7 and chapter 13 cases. The Judicial
Conference fee schedule was amended in 1993 to provide that an individual debtor may pay this fee in
installments.
Subdivision (a) of this rule is amended to clarify that every petition must be accompanied by any fee
prescribed under 28 U.S.C. §1930(b) that is required to be paid when a petition is filed, as well as the filing
fee prescribed by 28 U.S.C. §1930(a). By defining "filing fee" to include Judicial Conference fees, the
procedures set forth in subdivision (b) for paying the filing fee in installments will also apply with respect to
any Judicial Conference fee required to be paid at the commencement of the case.
GAP Report on Rule 1006. No changes since publication, except for a stylistic change in subdivision (a).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to include a reference to new subdivision (c), which deals with fee waivers
under 28 U.S.C. §1930(f), which was added in 2005.
Subdivision (b)(1) is amended to delete the sentence requiring a disclosure that the debtor has not paid an
attorney or other person in connection with the case. Inability to pay the filing fee in installments is one of the
requirements for a fee waiver under the 2005 revisions to 28 U.S.C. §1930(f). If the attorney payment
prohibition were retained, payment of an attorney's fee would render many debtors ineligible for installment
payments and thus enhance their eligibility for the fee waiver. The deletion of this prohibition from the rule,
which was not statutorily required, ensures that debtors who have the financial ability to pay the fee in
installments will do so rather than request a waiver.
Subdivision (b)(3) is amended in conformance with the changes to subdivision (b)(1) to reflect the 2005
amendments. The change is meant to clarify that subdivision (b)(3) refers to payments made after the debtor
has filed the bankruptcy case and after the debtor has received permission to pay the fee in installments.
Otherwise, the subdivision may conflict with the intent and effect of the amendments to subdivision (b)(1).
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2017 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b)(1) is amended to clarify that an individual debtor's voluntary petition, accompanied by an
application to pay the filing fee in installments, must be accepted for filing, even if the court requires the
[Release Point 118-106]
initial installment to be paid at the time the petition is filed and the debtor fails to make that payment. Because
the debtor's bankruptcy case is commenced upon the filing of the petition, dismissal of the case due to the
debtor's failure to make the initial or a subsequent installment payment is governed by Rule 1017(b)(1).
Rule 1007. Lists, Schedules, Statements, and Other Documents; Time Limits
(a) CORPORATE OWNERSHIP STATEMENT, LIST OF CREDITORS AND EQUITY
SECURITY HOLDERS, AND OTHER LISTS.
(1) Voluntary Case. In a voluntary case, the debtor shall file with the petition a list containing
the name and address of each entity included or to be included on Schedules D, E/F, G, and H as
prescribed by the Official Forms. If the debtor is a corporation, other than a governmental unit, the
debtor shall file with the petition a corporate ownership statement containing the information
described in Rule 7007.1. The debtor shall file a supplemental statement promptly upon any
change in circumstances that renders the corporate ownership statement inaccurate.
(2) Involuntary Case. In an involuntary case, the debtor shall file, within seven days after entry
of the order for relief, a list containing the name and address of each entity included or to be
included on Schedules D, E/F, G, and H as prescribed by the Official Forms.
(3) Equity Security Holders. In a chapter 11 reorganization case, unless the court orders
otherwise, the debtor shall file within 14 days after entry of the order for relief a list of the debtor's
equity security holders of each class showing the number and kind of interests registered in the
name of each holder, and the last known address or place of business of each holder.
(4) Chapter 15 Case. In addition to the documents required under §1515 of the Code, a foreign
representative filing a petition for recognition under chapter 15 shall file with the petition: (A) a
corporate ownership statement containing the information described in Rule 7007.1; and (B)
unless the court orders otherwise, a list containing the names and addresses of all persons or
bodies authorized to administer foreign proceedings of the debtor, all parties to litigation pending
in the United States in which the debtor is a party at the time of the filing of the petition, and all
entities against whom provisional relief is being sought under §1519 of the Code.
(5) Extension of Time. Any extension of time for the filing of the lists required by this
subdivision may be granted only on motion for cause shown and on notice to the United States
trustee and to any trustee, committee elected under §705 or appointed under §1102 of the Code, or
other party as the court may direct.
(b) SCHEDULES, STATEMENTS, AND OTHER DOCUMENTS REQUIRED.
(1) Except in a chapter 9 municipality case, the debtor, unless the court orders otherwise, shall
file the following schedules, statements, and other documents, prepared as prescribed by the
appropriate Official Forms, if any:
(A) schedules of assets and liabilities;
(B) a schedule of current income and expenditures;
(C) a schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases;
(D) a statement of financial affairs;
(E) copies of all payment advices or other evidence of payment, if any, received by the debtor
from an employer within 60 days before the filing of the petition, with redaction of all but the
last four digits of the debtor's social-security number or individual taxpayer-identification
number; and
(F) a record of any interest that the debtor has in an account or program of the type specified
in §521(c) of the Code.
(2) An individual debtor in a chapter 7 case shall file a statement of intention as required by
§521(a) of the Code, prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form. A copy of the
statement of intention shall be served on the trustee and the creditors named in the statement on or
before the filing of the statement.
(3) Unless the United States trustee has determined that the credit counseling requirement of
[Release Point 118-106]
§109(h) does not apply in the district, an individual debtor must file a statement of compliance
with the credit counseling requirement, prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form
which must include one of the following:
(A) an attached certificate and debt repayment plan, if any, required by §521(b);
(B) a statement that the debtor has received the credit counseling briefing required by
§109(h)(1) but does not have the certificate required by §521(b);
(C) a certification under §109(h)(3); or
(D) a request for a determination by the court under §109(h)(4).
(4) Unless §707(b)(2)(D) applies, an individual debtor in a chapter 7 case shall file a statement
of current monthly income prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form, and, if the
current monthly income exceeds the median family income for the applicable state and household
size, the information, including calculations, required by §707(b), prepared as prescribed by the
appropriate Official Form.
(5) An individual debtor in a chapter 11 case (unless under subchapter V) shall file a statement
of current monthly income, prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form.
(6) A debtor in a chapter 13 case shall file a statement of current monthly income, prepared as
prescribed by the appropriate Official Form, and, if the current monthly income exceeds the
median family income for the applicable state and household size, a calculation of disposable
income made in accordance with §1325(b)(3), prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official
Form.
(7) Unless an approved provider of an instructional course concerning personal financial
management has notified the court that a debtor has completed the course after filing the petition:
(A) An individual debtor in a chapter 7 or chapter 13 case shall file a statement of completion
of the course, prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form; and
(B) An individual debtor in a chapter 11 case shall file the statement if §1141(d)(3) applies.
(8) If an individual debtor in a chapter 11, 12, or 13 case has claimed an exemption under
§522(b)(3)(A) in property of the kind described in §522(p)(1) with a value in excess of the amount
set out in §522(q)(1), the debtor shall file a statement as to whether there is any proceeding
pending in which the debtor may be found guilty of a felony of a kind described in §522(q)(1)(A)
or found liable for a debt of the kind described in §522(q)(1)(B).
(c) TIME LIMITS. In a voluntary case, the schedules, statements, and other documents required
by subdivision (b)(1), (4), (5), and (6) shall be filed with the petition or within 14 days thereafter,
except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (d), (e), (f), and (h) of this rule. In an involuntary case,
the schedules, statements, and other documents required by subdivision (b)(1) shall be filed by the
debtor within 14 days after the entry of the order for relief. In a voluntary case, the documents
required by paragraphs (A), (C), and (D) of subdivision (b)(3) shall be filed with the petition. Unless
the court orders otherwise, a debtor who has filed a statement under subdivision (b)(3)(B), shall file
the documents required by subdivision (b)(3)(A) within 14 days of the order for relief. In a chapter 7
case, the debtor shall file the statement required by subdivision (b)(7) within 60 days after the first
date set for the meeting of creditors under §341 of the Code, and in a chapter 11 or 13 case no later
than the date when the last payment was made by the debtor as required by the plan or the filing of a
motion for a discharge under §1141(d)(5)(B) or §1328(b) of the Code. The court may, at any time
and in its discretion, enlarge the time to file the statement required by subdivision (b)(7). The debtor
shall file the statement required by subdivision (b)(8) no earlier than the date of the last payment
made under the plan or the date of the filing of a motion for a discharge under §§1141(d)(5)(B),1
1228(b), or 1328(b) of the Code. Lists, schedules, statements, and other documents filed prior to the
conversion of a case to another chapter shall be deemed filed in the converted case unless the court
directs otherwise. Except as provided in §1116(3), any extension of time to file schedules,
statements, and other documents required under this rule may be granted only on motion for cause
shown and on notice to the United States trustee, any committee elected under §705 or appointed
[Release Point 118-106]
under §1102 of the Code, trustee, examiner, or other party as the court may direct. Notice of an
extension shall be given to the United States trustee and to any committee, trustee, or other party as
the court may direct.
(d) LIST OF 20 LARGEST CREDITORS IN CHAPTER 9 MUNICIPALITY CASE OR
CHAPTER 11 REORGANIZATION CASE. In addition to the list required by subdivision (a) of this
rule, a debtor in a chapter 9 municipality case or a debtor in a voluntary chapter 11 reorganization
case shall file with the petition a list containing the name, address and claim of the creditors that hold
the 20 largest unsecured claims, excluding insiders, as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form.
In an involuntary chapter 11 reorganization case, such list shall be filed by the debtor within 2 days
after entry of the order for relief under §303(h) of the Code.
(e) LIST IN CHAPTER 9 MUNICIPALITY CASES. The list required by subdivision (a) of this
rule shall be filed by the debtor in a chapter 9 municipality case within such time as the court shall
fix. If a proposed plan requires a revision of assessments so that the proportion of special
assessments or special taxes to be assessed against some real property will be different from the
proportion in effect at the date the petition is filed, the debtor shall also file a list showing the name
and address of each known holder of title, legal or equitable, to real property adversely affected. On
motion for cause shown, the court may modify the requirements of this subdivision and subdivision
(a) of this rule.
(f) STATEMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. An individual debtor shall submit a
verified statement that sets out the debtor's social security number, or states that the debtor does not
have a social security number. In a voluntary case, the debtor shall submit the statement with the
petition. In an involuntary case, the debtor shall submit the statement within 14 days after the entry
of the order for relief.
(g) PARTNERSHIP AND PARTNERS. The general partners of a debtor partnership shall prepare
and file the list required under subdivision (a), schedules of the assets and liabilities, schedule of
current income and expenditures, schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases, and
statement of financial affairs of the partnership. The court may order any general partner to file a
statement of personal assets and liabilities within such time as the court may fix.
(h) INTERESTS ACQUIRED OR ARISING AFTER PETITION. If, as provided by §541(a)(5) of
the Code, the debtor acquires or becomes entitled to acquire any interest in property, the debtor shall
within 14 days after the information comes to the debtor's knowledge or within such further time the
court may allow, file a supplemental schedule in the chapter 7 liquidation case, chapter 11
reorganization case, chapter 12 family farmer's debt adjustment case, or chapter 13 individual debt
adjustment case. If any of the property required to be reported under this subdivision is claimed by
the debtor as exempt, the debtor shall claim the exemptions in the supplemental schedule. This duty
to file a supplemental schedule continues even after the case is closed, except for property acquired
after an order is entered:
(1) confirming a chapter 11 plan (other than one confirmed under §1191(b)); or
(2) discharging the debtor in a chapter 12 case, a chapter 13 case, or a case under subchapter V
of chapter 11 in which the plan is confirmed under §1191(b).
(i) DISCLOSURE OF LIST OF SECURITY HOLDERS. After notice and hearing and for cause
shown, the court may direct an entity other than the debtor or trustee to disclose any list of security
holders of the debtor in its possession or under its control, indicating the name, address and security
held by any of them. The entity possessing this list may be required either to produce the list or a true
copy thereof, or permit inspection or copying, or otherwise disclose the information contained on the
list.
(j) IMPOUNDING OF LISTS. On motion of a party in interest and for cause shown the court may
direct the impounding of the lists filed under this rule, and may refuse to permit inspection by any
entity. The court may permit inspection or use of the lists, however, by any party in interest on terms
prescribed by the court.
(k) PREPARATION OF LIST, SCHEDULES, OR STATEMENTS ON DEFAULT OF DEBTOR
. If a list, schedule, or statement, other than a statement of intention, is not prepared and filed as
[Release Point 118-106]
required by this rule, the court may order the trustee, a petitioning creditor, committee, or other party
to prepare and file any of these papers within a time fixed by the court. The court may approve
reimbursement of the cost incurred in complying with such an order as an administrative expense.
(l) TRANSMISSION TO UNITED STATES TRUSTEE. The clerk shall forthwith transmit to the
United States trustee a copy of every list, schedule, and statement filed pursuant to subdivision
(a)(1), (a)(2), (b), (d), or (h) of this rule.
(m) INFANTS AND INCOMPETENT PERSONS. If the debtor knows that a person on the list of
creditors or schedules is an infant or incompetent person, the debtor also shall include the name,
address, and legal relationship of any person upon whom process would be served in an adversary
proceeding against the infant or incompetent person in accordance with Rule 7004(b)(2).

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is an adaptation of former Rules 108, 8–106, 10–108 and 11–11. As specified in the rule, it is
applicable in all types of cases filed under the Code.
Subdivision (a) requires at least a list of creditors with their names and addresses to be filed with the
petition. This list is needed for notice of the meeting of creditors (Rule 2002) and notice of the order for relief
(§342 of the Code). The list will also serve to meet the requirements of §521(1) of the Code. Subdivision (a)
recognizes that it may be impossible to file the schedules required by §521(1) and subdivision (b) of the rule
at the time the petition is filed but in order for the case to proceed expeditiously and efficiently it is necessary
that the clerk have the names and addresses of creditors. It should be noted that subdivision (d) of the rule
requires a special list of the 20 largest unsecured creditors in chapter 9 and 11 cases. That list is for the
purpose of selecting a committee of unsecured creditors.
Subdivision (b) is derived from former Rule 11–11 and conforms with §521. This subdivision indicates the
forms to be used. The court may dispense with the filing of schedules and the statement of affairs pursuant to
§521.
Subdivisions (c) and (f) specify the time periods for filing the papers required by the rule as well as the
number of copies. The provisions dealing with an involuntary case are derived from former Bankruptcy Rule
108. Under the Code, a chapter 11 case may be commenced by an involuntary petition (§303(a)), whereas
under the Act, a Chapter XI case could have been commenced only by a voluntary petition. A motion for an
extension of time to file the schedules and statements is required to be made on notice to parties, as the court
may direct, including a creditors' committee if one has been appointed under §1102 of the Code and a trustee
or examiner if one has been appointed pursuant to §1104 of the Code. Although written notice is preferable, it
is not required by the rule; in proper circumstances the notice may be by telephone or otherwise.
Subdivision (d) is new and requires that a list of the 20 largest unsecured creditors, excluding insiders as
defined in §101(25) of the Code, be filed with the petition. The court, pursuant to §1102 of the Code, is
required to appoint a committee of unsecured creditors as soon as practicable after the order for relief. That
committee generally is to consist of the seven largest unsecured creditors who are willing to serve. The list
should, as indicated on Official Form No. 9, specify the nature and amount of the claim. It is important for the
court to be aware of the different types of claims existing in the case and this form should supply such
information.
Subdivision (e) applies only in chapter 9 municipality cases. It gives greater discretion to the court to
determine the time for filing a list of creditors and any other matter related to the list. A list of creditors must
at some point be filed since one is required by §924 of the Code. When the plan affects special assessments,
the definitions in §902(2) and (3) for "special tax payer" and "special tax payer affected by the plan" become
relevant.
Subdivision (g) is derived from former Rules 108(c) and 11–11. Nondebtor general partners are liable to the
partnership's trustee for any deficiency in the partnership's estate to pay creditors in full as provided by §723
of the Code. Subdivision (g) authorizes the court to require a partner to file a statement of personal assets and
liabilities to provide the trustee with the relevant information.
Subdivision (h) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 108(e) for chapter 7, 11 and 13 purposes. It
implements the provisions in and language of §541(a)(5) of the Code.
Subdivisions (i) and (j) are adapted from §§165 and 166 of the Act and former Rule 10–108(b) and (c)
[Release Point 118-106]
without change in substance. The term "party in interest" is not defined in the Code or the rules, but reference
may be made to §1109(b) of the Code. In the context of this subdivision, the term would include the debtor,
the trustee, any indenture trustee, creditor, equity security holder or committee appointed pursuant to §1102 of
the Code.
Subdivision (k) is derived from former Rules 108(d) and 10–108(a).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivisions (b), (c), and (g) are amended to provide for the filing of a schedule of current income and
current expenditures and the individual debtor's statement of intention. These documents are required by the
1984 amendments to §521 of the Code. Official Form No. 6A is prescribed for use by an individual debtor for
filing a schedule of current income and current expenditures in a chapter 7 or chapter 11 case. Although a
partnership or corporation is also required by §521(1) to file a schedule of current income and current
expenditures, no Official Form is prescribed therefor.
The time for filing the statement of intention is governed by §521(2)(A). A copy of the statement of
intention must be served on the trustee and the creditors named in the statement within the same time. The
provisions of subdivision (c) governing the time for filing when a chapter 11 or chapter 13 case is converted to
a chapter 7 case have been omitted from subdivision (c) as amended. Filing after conversion is now governed
exclusively by Rule 1019.
Subdivision (f) has been abrogated. The number of copies of the documents required by this rule will be
determined by local rule.
Subdivision (h) is amended to include a direct reference to §541(a)(5).
Subdivision (k) provides that the court may not order an entity other than the debtor to prepare and file the
statement of intention.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
References to Official Form numbers and to the Chapter 13 Statement are deleted and subdivision (b) is
amended in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms. The debtor in a chapter 12
or chapter 13 case shall file the list, schedules and statements required in subdivisions (a)(1), (b)(1), and (h). It
is expected that the information currently provided in the Chapter 13 Statement will be included in the
schedules and statements as revised not later than the effective date of these rule amendments.
Subdivisions (a)(4) and (c) are amended to provide the United States trustee with notice of any motion to
extend the time for the filing of any lists, schedules, or statements. Such notice enables the United States
trustee to take appropriate steps to avoid undue delay in the administration of the case. See 28 U.S.C.
§586(a)(3)(G). Subdivisions (a)(4) and (c) are amended further to provide notice to committees elected under
§705 or appointed pursuant to §1102 of the Code. Committees of retired employees appointed pursuant to
§1114 are not included.
The additions of references to unexpired leases in subdivisions (b)(1) and (g) indicate that the schedule
requires the inclusion of unexpired leases as well as other executory contracts.
The words "with the court" in subdivisions (b)(1), (e), and (g) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules
5005(a) and 9001(3).
Subdivision (l), which is derived from Rule X–1002(a), provides the United States trustee with the
information required to perform certain administrative duties such as the appointment of a committee of
unsecured creditors. In a chapter 7 case, the United States trustee should be aware of the debtor's intention
with respect to collateral that secures a consumer debt so that the United States trustee may monitor the
progress of the case. Pursuant to §307 of the Code, the United States trustee has standing to raise, appear and
be heard on issues and the lists, schedules and statements contain information that, when provided to the
United States trustee, enable that office to participate effectively in the case. The United States trustee has
standing to move to dismiss a chapter 7 or 13 case for failure to file timely the list, schedules or statement
required by §521(1) of the Code. See §§707(a)(3) and 1307(c)(9). It is therefore necessary for the United
States trustee to receive notice of any extension of time to file such documents. Upon request, the United
States trustee also may receive from the trustee or debtor in possession a list of equity security holders.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1996 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c) is amended to provide that schedules and statements filed prior to the conversion of a case
to another chapter shall be deemed filed in the converted case, whether or not the case was a chapter 7 case
prior to conversion. This amendment is in recognition of the 1991 amendments to the Official Forms that
abrogated the Chapter 13 Statement and made the same forms for schedules and statements applicable in all
cases.
This subdivision also contains a technical correction. The phrase "superseded case" creates the erroneous
[Release Point 118-106]
impression that conversion of a case results in a new case that is distinct from the original case. The effect of
conversion of a case is governed by §348 of the Code.
GAP Report on Rule 1007(c). No changes since publication, except for stylistic changes.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2001 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (m) is added to enable the person required to mail notices under Rule 2002 to mail them to the
appropriate guardian or other representative when the debtor knows that a creditor or other person listed is an
infant or incompetent person.
The proper mailing address of the representative is determined in accordance with Rule 7004(b)(2), which
requires mailing to the person's dwelling house or usual place of abode or at the place where the person
regularly conducts a business or profession.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2003 AMENDMENT
[Subdivision (a).] This rule is amended to require the debtor to file a corporate ownership statement setting
out the information described in Rule 7007.1. Requiring debtors to file the statement provides the court with
an opportunity to make judicial disqualification determinations at the outset of the case. This could reduce
problems later in the case by preventing the initial assignment of the case to a judge who holds a financial
interest in a parent company of the debtor or some other entity that holds a significant ownership interest in
the debtor. Moreover, by including the disclosure statement filing requirement at the commencement of the
case, the debtor does not have to make the same disclosure filing each time it is involved in an adversary
proceeding throughout the case. The debtor also must file supplemental statements as changes in ownership
might arise.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes since publication.
[Subdivisions (c) and (f).] The rule is amended to add a requirement that a debtor submit a statement setting
out the debtor's social security number. The addition is necessary because of the corresponding amendment to
Rule 1005 which now provides that the caption of the petition includes only the final four digits of the debtor's
social security number. The debtor submits the statement, but it is not filed, nor is it included in the case file.
The statement provides the information necessary to include on the service copy of the notice required under
Rule 2002(a)(1). It will also provide the information to facilitate the ability of creditors to search the court
record by a search of a social security number already in the creditor's possession.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The rule amendment is made in response to the extensive
commentary that urged the Advisory Committee to continue the obligation contained in current Rule 1005 that
a debtor must include his or her social security number on the caption of the bankruptcy petition. Rule 1005 is
amended to limit that disclosure to the final four digits of the social security number, and Rule 1007 is
amended to reinstate the obligation in a manner that will provide more protection of the debtor's privacy while
continuing access to the information to those persons with legitimate need for that data. The debtor must
disclose the information, but the method of disclosure is by a verified statement that is submitted to the clerk.
The statement is not filed in the case and does not become a part of the court record. Therefore, it enables the
clerk to deliver that information to the creditors and the trustee in the case, but it does not become a part of the
court record governed by §107 of the Bankruptcy Code and is not available to the public.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2005 AMENDMENT
Notice to creditors and other parties in interest is essential to the operation of the bankruptcy system.
Sending notice requires a convenient listing of the names and addresses of the entities to whom notice must be
sent, and virtually all of the bankruptcy courts have adopted a local rule requiring the submission of a list of
these entities with the petition and in a particular format. These lists are commonly called the "mailing
matrix."
Given the universal adoption of these local rules, the need for such lists in all cases is apparent.
Consequently, the rule is amended to require the debtor to submit such a list at the commencement of the case.
This list may be amended when necessary. See Rule 1009(a).
The content of the list is described by reference to Schedules D through H of the Official Forms rather than
by reference to creditors or persons holding claims. The cross reference to the Schedules as the source of the
names for inclusion in the list ensures that persons such as codebtors or nondebtor parties to executory
contracts and unexpired leases will receive appropriate notices in the case.
While this rule renders unnecessary, in part, local rules on the subject, this rule does not direct any
particular format or form for the list to take. Local rules still may govern those particulars of the list.
Subdivision (c) is amended to reflect that subdivision (a)(1) no longer requires the debtor to file a schedule
of liabilities with the petition in lieu of a list of creditors. The filing of the list is mandatory, and subdivision
[Release Point 118-106]
(b) of the rule requires the filing of schedules. Thus, subdivision (c) no longer needs to account for the
possibility that the debtor can delay filing a schedule of liabilities when the petition is accompanied by a list of
creditors. Subdivision (c) simply addresses the situation in which the debtor does not file schedules or
statements with the petition, and the procedure for seeking an extension of time for filing.
Other changes are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
The title of this rule is expanded to refer to "documents" in conformity with the 2005 amendments to §521
and related provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that include a wider range of documentary requirements.
Subdivision (a) is amended to require that any foreign representative filing a petition for recognition to
commence a case under chapter 15, which was added to the Code in 2005, file a list of entities with whom the
debtor is engaged in litigation in the United States. The foreign representative filing the petition for
recognition must also list any entities against whom provisional relief is being sought as well as all persons or
bodies authorized to administer foreign proceedings of the debtor. This should ensure that entities most
interested in the case, or their representatives, will receive notice of the petition under Rule 2002(q).
Subdivision (a)(4) is amended to require the foreign representative who files a petition for recognition
under chapter 15 to file the documents described in §1515 of the Code as well as a corporate ownership
statement. The subdivision is also amended to identify the foreign representative in language that more closely
follows the text of the Code. Former subdivision (a)(4) is renumbered as subdivision (a)(5) and stylistic
changes were made to the subdivision.
Subdivision (b)(1) addresses schedules, statements, and other documents that the debtor must file unless the
court orders otherwise and other than in a case under chapter 9. This subdivision is amended to include
documentary requirements added by the 2005 amendments to §521 that apply to the same group of debtors
and have the same time limits as the existing requirements of (b)(1). Consistent with the E-Government Act of
2002, Pub. L. No. 107–347, the payment advices should be redacted before they are filed.
Subdivision (b)(2) is amended to conform to the renumbering of the subsections of §521.
Subdivisions (b)(3) through (b)(8) are new and implement the 2005 amendments to the Code. Subdivision
(b)(3) provides for the filing of a document relating to the credit counseling requirement provided by the 2005
amendments to §109 in the context of an Official Form that warns the debtor of the consequences of failing to
comply with the credit counseling requirement.
Subdivision (b)(4) addresses the filing of information about current monthly income, as defined in §101, for
certain chapter 7 debtors and, if required, additional calculations of expenses required by the 2005
amendments to §707(b).
Subdivision (b)(5) addresses the filing of information about current monthly income, as defined in §101, for
individual chapter 11 debtors. The 2005 amendments to §1129(a)(15) condition plan confirmation for
individual debtors on the commitment of disposable income, as defined in §1325(b)(2), which is based on
current monthly income.
Subdivision (b)(6) addresses the filing of information about current monthly income, as defined in §101, for
chapter 13 debtors and, if required, additional calculations of expenses. These changes are necessary because
the 2005 amendments to §1325 require that the determination of disposable income begin with current
monthly income.
Subdivision (b)(7) reflects the 2005 amendments to §§727 and 1328 of the Code that condition the receipt
of a discharge on the completion of a personal financial management course, with certain exceptions. Certain
individual chapter 11 debtors may also be required to complete a personal financial management course under
§727(a)(11) as incorporated by §1141(d)(3)(C). To evidence compliance with that requirement, the
subdivision requires the debtor to file the appropriate Official Form certifying that the debtor has completed
the personal financial management course.
Subdivision (b)(8) requires an individual debtor in a case under chapter 11, 12, or 13 to file a statement that
there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the restrictions on a homestead exemption as set out in §522(q)
of the Code are applicable. Sections 1141(d)(5)(C), 1228(f), and 1328(h) each provide that the court shall not
enter a discharge order unless it finds that there is no reasonable cause to believe that §522(q) applies.
Requiring the debtor to submit a statement to that effect in cases under chapters 11, 12, and 13 in which an
exemption is claimed in excess of the amount allowed under §522(q)(1) provides the court with a basis to
conclude, in the absence of any contrary information, that §522(q) does not apply. Creditors receive notice
under Rule 2002(f)(11) of the time to request postponement of the entry of the discharge to permit an
opportunity to challenge the debtor's assertions in the Rule 1007(b)(8) statement in appropriate cases.
Subdivision (c) is amended to include time limits for the filing requirements added to subdivision (b) due to
[Release Point 118-106]
the 2005 amendments to the Code, and to make conforming amendments. Separate time limits are provided
for the documentation of credit counseling and for the statement of the completion of the financial
management course. While most documents relating to credit counseling must be filed with the voluntary
petition, the credit counseling certificate and debt repayment plan can be filed within 15 days of the filing of a
voluntary petition if the debtor files a statement under subdivision (b)(3)(B) with the petition. Sections
727(a)(11), 1141(d)(3), and 1328(g) of the Code require individual debtors to complete a personal financial
management course prior to the entry of a discharge. The amendment allows the court to enlarge the deadline
for the debtor to file the statement of completion. Because no party is harmed by the enlargement, no specific
restriction is placed on the court's discretion to enlarge the deadline, even after its expiration.
Subdivision (c) of the rule is also amended to recognize the limitation on the extension of time to file
schedules and statements when the debtor is a small business debtor. Section 1116(3), added to the Code in
2005, establishes a specific standard for courts to apply in the event that the debtor in possession or the trustee
seeks an extension for filing these forms for a period beyond 30 days after the order for relief.
Changes Made After Publication. Subdivision (a)(4) was amended to insert the requirement that the foreign
representative who files the chapter 15 petition must file the corporate ownership statement. Subdivision
(b)(4) was amended to provide that all individual debtors rather than just those whose debts are primarily
consumer debts must file the statement of current monthly income. Subdivisions (b)(7) and (c) were amended
to make the obligation to file a statement of the completion of a personal financial management course
applicable to certain individual chapter 11 debtors as well as to individual debtors in chapters 7 and 13.
Subdivision (c) is also amended to provide the court with broad discretion to enlarge the time to file the
statement of completion of a personal financial management course. The Committee Note was amended to
explain these changes.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. Each deadline in the rule of fewer than 30 days is
amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended
in the following manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2010 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a)(2). Subdivision (a)(2) is amended to shorten the time for a debtor to file a list of the
creditors included on the various schedules filed or to be filed in the case. This list provides the information
necessary for the clerk to provide notice of the §341meeting of creditors in a timely manner.
Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) is amended to provide additional time for individual debtors in chapter 7 to
file the statement of completion of a course in personal financial management. This change is made in
conjunction with an amendment to Rule 5009 requiring the clerk to provide notice to debtors of the
consequences of not filing the statement in a timely manner.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2012 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c). In subdivision (c), the time limit for a debtor in an involuntary case to file the list required
by subdivision (a)(2) is deleted as unnecessary. Subdivision (a)(2) provides that the list must be filed within
seven days after the entry of the order for relief. The other change to subdivision (c) is stylistic.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2013 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b)(7) is amended to relieve an individual debtor of the obligation to file a statement of
completion of a personal financial management course if the course provider notifies the court that the debtor
has completed the course. Course providers approved under §111 of the Code may be permitted to file this
notification electronically with the court immediately upon the debtor's completion of the course. If the
provider does not notify the court, the debtor must file the statement, prepared as prescribed by the appropriate
Official Form, within the time period specified by subdivision (c).
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2015 AMENDMENT
[Release Point 118-106]
In subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(2), the references to Schedules are amended to reflect the new designations
adopted as part of the Forms Modernization Project.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended in response to the enactment of the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, Pub.
L. No. 116–54, 133 Stat. 1079. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to be a debtor
under subchapter V of chapter 11. As amended, subdivision (b)(5) of the rule includes an exception for
subchapter V cases. Because Code §1129(a)(15) is inapplicable to such cases, there is no need for an
individual debtor in a subchapter V case to file a statement of current monthly income.
Subdivision (h) is amended to provide that the duty to file a supplemental schedule under the rule
terminates upon confirmation of the plan in a subchapter V case, unless the plan is confirmed under §1191(b),
in which case it terminates upon discharge as provided in §1192.

Rule 1008. Verification of Petitions and Accompanying Papers
All petitions, lists, schedules, statements and amendments thereto shall be verified or contain an
unsworn declaration as provided in 28 U.S.C. §1746.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule retains the requirement under the Bankruptcy Act and rules that petitions and accompanying
papers must be verified. Only the original need be signed and verified, but the copies must be conformed to
the original. See Rule 9011(c).
The verification may be replaced by an unsworn declaration as provided in 28 U.S.C. §1746. See also,
Official Form No. 1 and Advisory Committee Note.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The amendments to this rule are stylistic.
Rule 1009. Amendments of Voluntary Petitions, Lists, Schedules and Statements
(a) GENERAL RIGHT TO AMEND. A voluntary petition, list, schedule, or statement may be
amended by the debtor as a matter of course at any time before the case is closed. The debtor shall
give notice of the amendment to the trustee and to any entity affected thereby. On motion of a party
in interest, after notice and a hearing, the court may order any voluntary petition, list, schedule, or
statement to be amended and the clerk shall give notice of the amendment to entities designated by
the court.
(b) STATEMENT OF INTENTION. The statement of intention may be amended by the debtor at
any time before the expiration of the period provided in §521(a) of the Code. The debtor shall give
notice of the amendment to the trustee and to any entity affected thereby.
(c) STATEMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. If a debtor becomes aware that the
statement of social security number submitted under Rule 1007(f) is incorrect, the debtor shall
promptly submit an amended verified statement setting forth the correct social security number. The
debtor shall give notice of the amendment to all of the entities required to be included on the list filed
under Rule 1007(a)(1) or (a)(2).
(d) TRANSMISSION TO UNITED STATES TRUSTEE. The clerk shall promptly transmit to the
United States trustee a copy of every amendment filed or submitted under subdivision (a), (b), or (c)
of this rule.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 12, 2006, eff.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
[Release Point 118-106]
This rule continues the permissive approach adopted by former Bankruptcy Rule 110 to amendments of
voluntary petitions and accompanying papers. Notice of any amendment is required to be given to the trustee.
This is particularly important with respect to any amendment of the schedule of property affecting the debtor's
claim of exemptions. Notice of any amendment of the schedule of liabilities is to be given to any creditor
whose claim is changed or newly listed.
The rule does not continue the provision permitting the court to order an amendment on its own initiative.
Absent a request in some form by a party in interest, the court should not be involved in administrative matters
affecting the estate.
If a list or schedule is amended to include an additional creditor, the effect on the dischargeability of the
creditor's claim is governed by the provisions of §523(a)(3) of the Code.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to require notice and a hearing in the event a party in interest other than the
debtor seeks to amend. The number of copies of the amendment will be determined by local rule of court.
Subdivision (b) is added to treat amendments of the statement of intention separately from other
amendments. The intention of the individual debtor must be performed within 45 days of the filing of the
statement, unless the court extends the period. Subdivision (b) limits the time for amendment to the time for
performance under §521(2)(B) of the Code or any extension granted by the court.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The amendments to subdivision (a) are stylistic.
Subdivision (c) is derived from Rule X–1002(a) and is designed to provide the United States trustee with
current information to enable that office to participate effectively in the case.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2006 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c). Rule 2002(a)(1) provides that the notice of the §341 meeting of creditors include the
debtor's social security number. It provides creditors with the full number while limiting publication of the
social security number otherwise to the final four digits of the number to protect the debtor's identity from
others who do not have the same need for that information. If, however, the social security number that the
debtor submitted under Rule 1007(f) is incorrect, then the only notice to the entities contained on the list filed
under Rule 1007(a)(1) or (a)(2) would be incorrect. This amendment adds a new subdivision (c) that directs
the debtor to submit a verified amended statement of social security number and to give notice of the new
statement to all entities in the case who received the notice containing the erroneous social security number.
Subdivision (d). Former subdivision (c) becomes subdivision (d) and is amended to include new subdivision
(c) amendments in the list of documents that the clerk must transmit to the United States trustee.
Other amendments are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is amended to conform to the 2005 amendments to §521 of the Code.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
Rule 1010. Service of Involuntary Petition and Summons
(a) SERVICE OF INVOLUNTARY PETITION AND SUMMONS. On the filing of an
involuntary petition, the clerk shall forthwith issue a summons for service. When an involuntary
petition is filed, service shall be made on the debtor. The summons shall be served with a copy of the
petition in the manner provided for service of a summons and complaint by Rule 7004(a) or (b). If
service cannot be so made, the court may order that the summons and petition be served by mailing
copies to the party's last known address, and by at least one publication in a manner and form
directed by the court. The summons and petition may be served on the party anywhere. Rule 7004(e)
and Rule 4(l) F.R.Civ.P. apply when service is made or attempted under this rule.
(b) CORPORATE OWNERSHIP STATEMENT. Each petitioner that is a corporation shall file
with the involuntary petition a corporate ownership statement containing the information described
in Rule 7007.1.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff.

[Release Point 118-106]
Dec. 1, 2016.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule provides the procedure for service of the involuntary petition and summons. It does not deal with
service of a summons and complaint instituting an adversary proceeding pursuant to Part VII.
While this rule is similar to former Bankruptcy Rule 111, it substitutes the clerk of the bankruptcy court for
the clerk of the district court as the person who is to issue the summons.
The modes of service prescribed by the rule are personal or by mail, when service can be effected in one of
these ways in the United States. Such service is to be made in the manner prescribed in adversary proceedings
by Rule 7004(a) and (b). If service must be made in a foreign country, the mode of service is one of that set
forth in Rule 4(i) F.R.Civ.P.
When the methods set out in Rule 7004(a) and (b) cannot be utilized, service by publication coupled with
mailing to the last known address is authorized. Cf. Rule 7004(c). The court determines the form and manner
of publication as provided in Rule 9007. The publication need not set out the petition or the order directing
service by publication. In order to apprise the debtor fairly, however, the publication should include all the
information required to be in the summons by Official Form No. 13 and a notice indicating how service is
being effected and how a copy of the petition may be obtained.
There are no territorial limits on the service authorized by this rule, which continues the practice under the
former rules and Act. There must, however, be a basis for jurisdiction pursuant to §109(a) of the Code for the
court to order relief. Venue provisions are set forth in 28 U.S.C. §1472.
Subdivision (f) of Rule 7004 and subdivisions (g) and (h) of Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. govern time and proof of
service and amendment of process or of proof of service.
Rule 1004 provides for transmission to nonpetitioning partners of a petition filed against the partnership by
fewer than all the general partners.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
The rule has been broadened to include service of a petition commencing a case ancillary to a foreign
proceeding, previously included in Rule 1003(e)(2).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Reference to the Official Form number is deleted in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the
Official Forms.
Rule 4(g) and (h) F.R.Civ.P. made applicable by this rule refers to Rule 4(g) and (h) F.R.Civ.P. in effect on
January 1, 1990, notwithstanding any subsequent amendment thereto. See Rule 7004(g).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to delete the reference to the Official Form. The Official Form for the summons was
abrogated in 1991. Other amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1997 AMENDMENT
The amendments to this rule are technical, are promulgated solely to conform to changes in subdivision
designations in Rule 4, F.R.Civ.P., and in Rule 7004, and are not intended to effectuate any material change in
substance.
In 1996, the letter designation of subdivision (f) of Rule 7004 (Summons; Time Limit for Service) was
changed to subdivision (e). In 1993, the provisions of Rule 4, F.R.Civ.P., relating to proof of service contained
in Rule 4(g) (Return) and Rule 4(h) (Amendments), were placed in the new subdivision (l) of Rule 4 (Proof of
Service). The technical amendments to Rule 1010 are designed solely to conform to these new subdivision
designations.
The 1996 amendments to Rule 7004 and the 1993 amendments to Rule 4, F.R.Civ.P., have not affected the
availability of service by first class mail in accordance with Rule 7004(b) for the service of a summons and
petition in an involuntary case commenced under §303 or an ancillary case commenced under §304 of the
Code.
GAP Report on Rule 1010. These amendments, which are technical and conforming, were not published for
comment.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to implement the 2005 amendments to the Code, which repealed §304 and replaced it
with chapter 15 governing ancillary and other cross-border cases. Under chapter 15, a foreign representative
commences a case by filing a petition for recognition of a pending foreign nonmain proceeding. The
[Release Point 118-106]
amendment requires service of the summons and petition on the debtor and any entity against whom the
representative is seeking provisional relief. Until the court enters a recognition order under §1517, no stay is
in effect unless the court enters some form of provisional relief under §1519. Thus, only those entities against
whom specific provisional relief is sought need to be served. The court may, however, direct that service be
made on additional entities as appropriate.
This rule does not apply to a petition for recognition of a foreign main proceeding.
The rule is also amended by renumbering the prior rule as subdivision (a) and adding a new subdivision (b)
requiring any corporate creditor that files or joins an involuntary petition to file a corporate ownership
statement.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2016 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) of this rule is amended to remove provisions regarding the issuance of a summons for
service in certain chapter 15 proceedings. The requirements for notice and service in chapter 15 proceedings
are found in Rule 2002(q).
REFERENCES IN TEXT
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, referred to in subd. (a), are set out in the Appendix to Title 28,
Judiciary and Judicial Procedure.
Rule 1011. Responsive Pleading or Motion in Involuntary Cases
(a) WHO MAY CONTEST PETITION. The debtor named in an involuntary petition may contest
the petition. In the case of a petition against a partnership under Rule 1004, a nonpetitioning general
partner, or a person who is alleged to be a general partner but denies the allegation, may contest the
petition.
(b) DEFENSES AND OBJECTIONS; WHEN PRESENTED. Defenses and objections to the
petition shall be presented in the manner prescribed by Rule 12 F.R.Civ.P. and shall be filed and
served within 21 days after service of the summons, except that if service is made by publication on
a party or partner not residing or found within the state in which the court sits, the court shall
prescribe the time for filing and serving the response.
(c) EFFECT OF MOTION. Service of a motion under Rule 12(b) F.R.Civ.P. shall extend the time
for filing and serving a responsive pleading as permitted by Rule 12(a) F.R.Civ.P.
(d) CLAIMS AGAINST PETITIONERS. A claim against a petitioning creditor may not be
asserted in the answer except for the purpose of defeating the petition.
(e) OTHER PLEADINGS. No other pleadings shall be permitted, except that the court may order
a reply to an answer and prescribe the time for filing and service.
(f) CORPORATE OWNERSHIP STATEMENT. If the entity responding to the involuntary
petition is a corporation, the entity shall file with its first appearance, pleading, motion, response, or
other request addressed to the court a corporate ownership statement containing the information
described in Rule 7007.1.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004; Apr. 23, 2008, eff.
Dec. 1, 2008; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009; Apr. 28, 2016, eff. Dec. 1, 2016.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 112. A petition filed by fewer than all the general
partners under Rule 1004(b) to have an order for relief entered with respect to the partnership is referred to as
a petition against the partnership because of the adversary character of the proceeding it commences. Cf.
§303(b)(3) of the Code; 2 Collier Bankruptcy 303.05[5][a] (15th ed. 1981); 2 id. 18.33[2], 18.46 (14th ed.
1966). One who denies an allegation of membership in the firm is nevertheless recognized as a party entitled
to contest a petition filed against a partnership under subdivision (b) of Rule 1004 in view of the possible
consequences to him of an order for relief against the entity alleged to include him as a member. See §723 of
the Code; Francis v. McNeal, 228 U.S. 695 (1913); Manson v. Williams, 213 U.S. 453 (1909); Carter v.
Whisler, 275 Fed. 743, 746–747 (8th Cir. 1921). The rule preserves the features of the former Act and Rule
112 and the Code permitting no response by creditors to an involuntary petition or petition against a
partnership under Rule 1004(b).
[Release Point 118-106]
Subdivision (b): Rule 12 F.R.Civ.P. has been looked to by the courts as prescribing the mode of making a
defense or objection to a petition in bankruptcy. See Fada of New York, Inc. v. Organization Service Co., Inc.,
125 F.2d 120. (2d Cir. 1942); In the Matter of McDougald, 17 F.R.D. 2, 5 (W.D. Ark. 1955); In the Matter of
Miller, 6 Fed. Rules Serv. 12f.26, Case No. 1 (N.D. Ohio 1942); Tatum v. Acadian Production Corp. of La.,
35 F. Supp. 40, 50 (E.D. La. 1940); 2 Collier, supra 303.07 (15th ed. 1981); 2 id. at 134–40 (14th ed. 1966).
As pointed out in the Note accompanying former Bankruptcy Rule 915 an objection that a debtor is neither
entitled to the benefits of the Code nor amenable to an involuntary petition goes to jurisdiction of the subject
matter and may be made at any time consistent with Rule 12(h)(3) F.R.Civ.P. Nothing in this rule recognizes
standing in a creditor or any other person not authorized to contest a petition to raise an objection that a person
eligible to file a voluntary petition cannot be the subject of an order for relief on an involuntary petition. See
Seligson & King, Jurisdiction and Venue in Bankruptcy, 36 Ref.J. 36, 38–40 (1962).
As Collier has pointed out with respect to the Bankruptcy Act, "the mechanics of the provisions in §18a and
b relating to time for appearance and pleading are unnecessarily confusing. . . . It would seem, though, to be
more straightforward to provide, as does Federal Rule 12(a), that the time to respond runs from the date of
service rather than the date of issuance of process." 2 Collier, supra at 119. The time normally allowed for the
service and filing of an answer or motion under Rule 1011 runs from the date of the issuance of the summons.
Compare Rule 7012. Service of the summons and petition will ordinarily be made by mail under Rule 1010
and must be made within 10 days of the issuance of the summons under Rule 7004(e), which governs the time
of service. When service is made by publication, the court should fix the time for service and filing of the
response in the light of all the circumstances so as to afford a fair opportunity to the debtor to enter a defense
or objection without unduly delaying the hearing on the petition. Cf. Rule 12(a) F.R.Civ.P.
Subdivision (c): Under subdivision (c), the timely service of a motion permitted by Rule 12(b), (e), (f), or
(h) F.R.Civ.P. alters the time within which an answer must be filed. If the court denies a motion or postpones
its disposition until trial on the merits, the answer must be served within 10 days after notice of the court's
action. If the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the answer may be served any time within 10
days after the service of the more definite statement.
Many of the rules governing adversary proceedings apply to proceedings on a contested petition unless the
court otherwise directs as provided in Rule 1018. The specific provisions of this Rule 1011 or 7005, however,
govern the filing of an answer or motion responsive to a petition. The rules of Part VII are adaptations of the
corresponding Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the effect of Rule 1018 is thus to make the provisions of
Civil Rules 5, 8, 9, 15, and 56, inter alia, generally applicable to the making of defenses and objections to the
petition. Rule 1018 follows prior law and practice in this respect. See 2 Collier, Bankruptcy 18.39–18.41
(14th ed. 1966).
Subdivision (d). This subdivision adopts the position taken in many cases that an affirmative judgment
against a petitioning creditor cannot be sought by a counterclaim filed in an answer to an involuntary petition.
See, e.g., Georgia Jewelers, Inc. v. Bulova Watch Co., 302 F.2d 362, 369–70 (5th Cir. 1962); Associated
Electronic Supply Co. of Omaha v. C.B.S. Electronic Sales Corp., 288 F.2d 683, 684–85 (8th Cir. 1961). The
subdivision follows Harris v. Capehart-Farnsworth Corp., 225 F.2d 268 (8th Cir. 1955), in permitting the
debtor to challenge the standing of a petitioner by filing a counterclaim against him. It does not foreclose the
court from rejecting a counterclaim that cannot be determined without unduly delaying the decision upon the
petition. See In the Matter of Bichel Optical Laboratories, Inc., 299 F. Supp. 545 (D. Minn. 1969).
Subdivision (e). This subdivision makes it clear that no reply needs to be made to an answer, including one
asserting a counterclaim, unless the court orders otherwise.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
The rule has been broadened to make applicable in ancillary cases the provisions concerning responsive
pleadings to involuntary petitions.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2004 AMENDMENT
The amendment to Rule 1004 that became effective on December 1, 2002, deleted former subdivision (a) of
that rule leaving only the provisions relating to involuntary petitions against partnerships. The rule no longer
includes subdivisions. Therefore, this technical amendment changes the reference to Rule 1004(b) to Rule
1004.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to reflect the 2005 amendments to the Code, which repealed §304 and added chapter
15. Section 304 covered cases ancillary to foreign proceedings, while chapter 15 governs ancillary and other
cross-border cases and introduces the concept of a petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding.
The rule is also amended in tandem with the amendment to Rule 1010 to require the parties responding to
[Release Point 118-106]
an involuntary petition and a petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding to file corporate ownership
statements to assist the court in determining whether recusal is necessary.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2016 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to remove provisions regarding chapter 15 proceedings. The requirements for
responses to a petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding are found in Rule 1012.
REFERENCES IN TEXT
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, referred to in subds. (b) and (c), are set out in the Appendix to Title
28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure.
Rule 1012. Responsive Pleading in Cross-Border Cases
(a) WHO MAY CONTEST PETITION. The debtor or any party in interest may contest a petition
for recognition of a foreign proceeding.
(b) OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES; WHEN PRESENTED. Objections and other responses to
the petition shall be presented no later than seven days before the date set for the hearing on the
petition, unless the court prescribes some other time or manner for responses.
(c) CORPORATE OWNERSHIP STATEMENT. If the entity responding to the petition is a
corporation, then the entity shall file a corporate ownership statement containing the information
described in Rule 7007.1 with its first appearance, pleading, motion, response, or other request
addressed to the court.
(Added Apr. 28, 2016, eff. Dec. 1, 2016.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987
This rule [former Rule 1012—Examination of Debtor, Including Discovery, on Issue of Nonpayment of
Debts in Involuntary Cases] is abrogated [abrogated Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987]. The discovery rules
apply whenever an involuntary petition is contested. Rule 1018.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2016 AMENDMENT
This rule is added to govern responses to petitions for recognition in cross-border cases. It incorporates
provisions formerly found in Rule 1011. Subdivision (a) provides that the debtor or a party in interest may
contest the petition. Subdivision (b) provides for presentation of responses no later than 7 days before the
hearing on the petition, unless the court directs otherwise. Subdivision (c) governs the filing of corporate
ownership statements by entities responding to the petition.
Rule 1013. Hearing and Disposition of a Petition in an Involuntary Case
(a) CONTESTED PETITION. The court shall determine the issues of a contested petition at the
earliest practicable time and forthwith enter an order for relief, dismiss the petition, or enter any
other appropriate order.
(b) DEFAULT. If no pleading or other defense to a petition is filed within the time provided by
Rule 1011, the court, on the next day, or as soon thereafter as practicable, shall enter an order for the
relief requested in the petition.
[Release Point 118-106]
[(c) ORDER FOR RELIEF] (Abrogated Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Aug. 1, 1993)
(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Aug. 1, 1993.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 115(a) and (c) and applies in chapter 7 and 11 cases. The
right to trial by jury under §19a of the Bankruptcy Act has been abrogated and the availability of a trial by
jury is within the discretion of the bankruptcy judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1480(b). Rule 9015 governs the
demand for a jury trial.
Subdivision (b) of Rule 1013 is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 115(c) and §18(e) of the Bankruptcy
Act. If an order for relief is not entered on default, dismissal will ordinarily be appropriate but the court may
postpone definitive action. See also Rule 9024 with respect to setting aside an order for relief on default for
cause.
Subdivision (e) of former Bankruptcy Rule 115 has not been carried over because its provisions are covered
by §303(i) of the Code.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Reference to the Official Form number is deleted in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the
Official Forms.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c) is abrogated because the official form for the order for relief was abrogated in 1991. Other
amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.
Rule 1014. Dismissal and Change of Venue
(a) DISMISSAL AND TRANSFER OF CASES.
(1) Cases Filed in Proper District. If a petition is filed in the proper district, the court, on the
timely motion of a party in interest or on its own motion, and after hearing on notice to the
petitioners, the United States trustee, and other entities as directed by the court, may transfer the
case to any other district if the court determines that the transfer is in the interest of justice or for
the convenience of the parties.
(2) Cases Filed in Improper District. If a petition is filed in an improper district, the court, on
the timely motion of a party in interest or on its own motion, and after hearing on notice to the
petitioners, the United States trustee, and other entities as directed by the court, may dismiss the
case or transfer it to any other district if the court determines that transfer is in the interest of
justice or for the convenience of the parties.
(b) PROCEDURE WHEN PETITIONS INVOLVING THE SAME DEBTOR OR RELATED
DEBTORS ARE FILED IN DIFFERENT COURTS. If petitions commencing cases under the Code
or seeking recognition under chapter 15 are filed in different districts by, regarding, or against (1) the
same debtor, (2) a partnership and one or more of its general partners, (3) two or more general
partners, or (4) a debtor and an affiliate, the court in the district in which the first-filed petition is
pending may determine, in the interest of justice or for the convenience of the parties, the district or
districts in which any of the cases should proceed. The court may so determine on motion and after a
hearing, with notice to the following entities in the affected cases: the United States trustee, entities
entitled to notice under Rule 2002(a), and other entities as the court directs. The court may order the
parties to the later-filed cases not to proceed further until it makes the determination.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 116 which contained venue as well as transfer provisions.
Public Law 95–598, however, placed the venue provisions in 28 U.S.C. §1472, and no purpose is served by
repeating them in this rule. Transfer of cases is provided in 28 U.S.C. §1475 but this rule adds the procedure
for obtaining transfer. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1472, proper venue for cases filed under the Code is either the
[Release Point 118-106]
district of domicile, residence, principal place of business, or location of principal assets for 180 days or the
longer portion thereof immediately preceding the petition. 28 U.S.C. §1475 permits the court to transfer a case
in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties. If the venue is improper, the court may retain
or transfer the case in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§1477.
Subdivision (a) of the rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 116(b). It implements 28 U.S.C. §§1475
and 1477 and clarifies the procedure to be followed in requesting and effecting transfer of a case. Subdivision
(a) protects the parties against being subjected to a transfer except on a timely motion of a party in interest. If
the transfer would result in fragmentation or duplication of administration, increase expense, or delay closing
the estate, such a factor would bear on the timeliness of the motion as well as on the propriety of the transfer
under the standards prescribed in subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) of the rule requires the interest of justice and
the convenience of the parties to be the grounds of any transfer of a case or of the retention of a case filed in
an improper district as does 28 U.S.C. §1477. Cf. 28 U.S.C. §1404(a) (district court may transfer any civil
action "[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice"). It also expressly requires a
hearing on notice to the petitioner or petitioners before the transfer of any case may be ordered. Under this
rule, a motion by a party in interest is necessary. There is no provision for the court to act on its own initiative.
Subdivision (b) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 116(c). It authorizes the court in which the first
petition is filed under the Code by or against a debtor to entertain a motion seeking a determination whether
the case so commenced should continue or be transferred and consolidated or administered jointly with
another case commenced by or against the same or related person in another court under a different chapter of
the Code. Subdivision (b) is correlated with 28 U.S.C. §1472 which authorizes petitioners to file cases
involving a partnership and partners or affiliated debtors.
The reference in subdivision (b) to petitions filed "by" a partner or "by" any other of the persons mentioned
is to be understood as referring to voluntary petitions. It is not the purpose of this subdivision to permit more
than one case to be filed in the same court because a creditor signing an involuntary petition happens to be a
partner, a partnership, or an affiliate of a debtor.
Transfers of adversary proceedings in cases under title 11 are governed by Rule 7087 and 28 U.S.C. §1475.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Both paragraphs 1 and 2 of subdivision (a) are amended to conform to the standard for transfer in 28 U.S.C.
§1412. Formerly, 28 U.S.C. §1477 authorized a court either to transfer or retain a case which had been
commenced in a district where venue was improper. However, 28 U.S.C. §1412, which supersedes 28 U.S.C.
§1477, authorizes only the transfer of a case. The rule is amended to delete the reference to retention of a case
commenced in the improper district. Dismissal of a case commenced in the improper district as authorized by
28 U.S.C. §1406 has been added to the rule. If a timely motion to dismiss for improper venue is not filed, the
right to object to venue is waived.
The last sentence of the rule has been deleted as unnecessary.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is amended to provide that a motion for transfer of venue under this subdivision shall be
filed in the district in which the first petition is pending. If the case commenced by the first petition has been
transferred to another district prior to the filing of a motion to transfer a related case under this subdivision,
the motion must be filed in the district to which the first petition had been transferred.
The other amendments to this rule are consistent with the responsibilities of the United States trustee in the
supervision and administration of cases pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §586(a)(3). The United States trustee may
appear and be heard on issues relating to the transfer of the case or dismissal due to improper venue. See §307
of the Code.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2007 AMENDMENT
Courts have generally held that they have the authority to dismiss or transfer cases on their own motion.
The amendment recognizes this authority and also provides that dismissal or transfer of the case may take
place only after notice and a hearing.
Other amendments are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2010 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) of the rule is amended to provide that petitions for recognition of a foreign
proceeding are included among those that are governed by the procedure for determining where cases should
go forward when multiple petitions involving the same debtor are filed. The amendment adds a specific
[Release Point 118-106]
reference to chapter 15 petitions and also provides that the rule governs proceedings regarding a debtor as well
as those that are filed by or against a debtor.
Other changes are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) provides a practical solution for resolving venue issues when related cases are filed in
different districts. It designates the court in which the first-filed petition is pending as the decision maker if a
party seeks a determination of where the related cases should proceed. Subdivision (b) is amended to clarify
when proceedings in the subsequently filed cases are stayed. It requires an order of the court in which the
first-filed petition is pending to stay proceedings in the related cases. Requiring a court order to trigger the
stay will prevent the disruption of other cases unless there is a judicial determination that this subdivision of
the rule applies and that a stay of related cases is needed while the court makes its venue determination.
Notice of the hearing must be given to all debtors, trustees, creditors, indenture trustees, and United States
trustees in the affected cases, as well as any other entity that the court directs. Because the clerk of the court
that makes the determination often may lack access to the names and addresses of entities in other cases, a
court may order the moving party to provide notice.
The other changes to subdivision (b) are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The only change made after publication and comment was
stylistic.
Rule 1015. Consolidation or Joint Administration of Cases Pending in Same
Court
(a) CASES INVOLVING SAME DEBTOR. If two or more petitions by, regarding, or against the
same debtor are pending in the same court, the court may order consolidation of the cases.
(b) CASES INVOLVING TWO OR MORE RELATED DEBTORS. If a joint petition or two or
more petitions are pending in the same court by or against (1) spouses, or (2) a partnership and one
or more of its general partners, or (3) two or more general partners, or (4) a debtor and an affiliate,
the court may order a joint administration of the estates. Prior to entering an order the court shall
give consideration to protecting creditors of different estates against potential conflicts of interest.
An order directing joint administration of individual cases of spouses shall, if one spouse has elected
the exemptions under §522(b)(2) of the Code and the other has elected the exemptions under
§522(b)(3), fix a reasonable time within which either may amend the election so that both shall have
elected the same exemptions. The order shall notify the debtors that unless they elect the same
exemptions within the time fixed by the court, they will be deemed to have elected the exemptions
provided by §522(b)(2).
(c) EXPEDITING AND PROTECTIVE ORDERS. When an order for consolidation or joint
administration of a joint case or two or more cases is entered pursuant to this rule, while protecting
the rights of the parties under the Code, the court may enter orders as may tend to avoid unnecessary
costs and delay.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; Apr. 28, 2010, eff.
Dec. 1, 2010; Apr. 27, 2017, eff. Dec. 1, 2017.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a) of this rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 117(a). It applies to cases when the
same debtor is named in both voluntary and involuntary petitions, when husband and wife have filed a joint
petition pursuant to §302 of the Code, and when two or more involuntary petitions are filed against the same
debtor. It also applies when cases are pending in the same court by virtue of a transfer of one or more petitions
from another court. Subdivision (c) allows the court discretion regarding the order of trial of issues raised by
two or more involuntary petitions against the same debtor.
Subdivision (b) recognizes the propriety of joint administration of estates in certain kinds of cases. The
election or appointment of one trustee for two or more jointly administered estates is authorized by Rule 2009.
[Release Point 118-106]
The authority of the court to order joint administration under subdivision (b) extends equally to the situation
when the petitions are filed under different sections, e.g., when one petition is voluntary and the other
involuntary, and when all of the petitions are filed under the same section of the Code.
Consolidation of cases implies a unitary administration of the estate and will ordinarily be indicated under
the circumstances to which subdivision (a) applies. This rule does not deal with the consolidation of cases
involving two or more separate debtors. Consolidation of the estates of separate debtors may sometimes be
appropriate, as when the affairs of an individual and a corporation owned or controlled by that individual are
so intermingled that the court cannot separate their assets and liabilities. Consolidation, as distinguished from
joint administration, is neither authorized nor prohibited by this rule since the propriety of consolidation
depends on substantive considerations and affects the substantive rights of the creditors of the different
estates. For illustrations of the substantive consolidation of separate estates, see Sampsell v. Imperial Paper &
Color Corp., 313 U.S. 215 (1941). See also Chemical Bank N.Y. Trust Co. v. Kheel, 369 F.2d 845 (2d Cir.
1966); Seligson & Mandell, Multi-Debtor Petition—Consolidation of Debtors and Due Process of Law, 73
Com.L.J. 341 (1968); Kennedy, Insolvency and the Corporate Veil in the United States in Proceedings of the
8th International Symposium on Comparative Law 232, 248–55 (1971).
Joint administration as distinguished from consolidation may include combining the estates by using a
single docket for the matters occurring in the administration, including the listing of filed claims, the
combining of notices to creditors of the different estates, and the joint handling of other purely administrative
matters that may aid in expediting the cases and rendering the process less costly.
Subdivision (c) is an adaptation of the provisions of Rule 42(a) F.R.Civ.P. for the purposes of
administration of estates under this rule. The rule does not deal with filing fees when an order for the
consolidation of cases or joint administration of estates is made.
A joint petition of husband and wife, requiring the payment of a single filing fee, is permitted by §302 of
the Code. Consolidation of such a case, however, rests in the discretion of the court; see §302(b) of the Code.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
The amendment to subdivision (b) implements the provisions of §522(b) of the Code, as enacted by the
1984 amendments.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to conform to the change in the numbering of §522(b) of the Code that was made as a
part of the 2005 amendments. Former subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) of §522 were renumbered as subsections
(b)(2) and (b)(3), respectively. The rule is amended to make the parallel change.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2010 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a). By amending subdivision (a) to include cases regarding the same debtor, the rule explicitly
recognizes that the court's authority to consolidate cases when more than one petition is filed includes the
authority to consolidate cases when one or more of the petitions is filed under chapter 15. This amendment is
made in conjunction with the amendment to Rule 1014(b), which also governs petitions filed under chapter 15
regarding the same debtor as well as those filed by or against the debtor.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2017 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is amended to replace "a husband and wife" with "spouses" in light of the Supreme Court's
decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015).
Rule 1016. Death or Incompetency of Debtor
Death or incompetency of the debtor shall not abate a liquidation case under chapter 7 of the
Code. In such event the estate shall be administered and the case concluded in the same manner, so
far as possible, as though the death or incompetency had not occurred. If a reorganization, family
farmer's debt adjustment, or individual's debt adjustment case is pending under chapter 11, chapter
12, or chapter 13, the case may be dismissed; or if further administration is possible and in the best
interest of the parties, the case may proceed and be concluded in the same manner, so far as possible,
as though the death or incompetency had not occurred.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
[Release Point 118-106]
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Rules 118 and 11–16. In a chapter 11 reorganization case or chapter 13
individual's debt adjustment case, the likelihood is that the case will be dismissed.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to conform to 25 F.R.Civ.P. and to include chapter 12 cases.
Rule 1017. Dismissal or Conversion of Case; Suspension
(a) VOLUNTARY DISMISSAL; DISMISSAL FOR WANT OF PROSECUTION OR OTHER
CAUSE. Except as provided in §§707(a)(3), 707(b), 1208(b), and 1307(b) of the Code, and in Rule
1017(b), (c), and (e), a case shall not be dismissed on motion of the petitioner, for want of
prosecution or other cause, or by consent of the parties, before a hearing on notice as provided in
Rule 2002. For the purpose of the notice, the debtor shall file a list of creditors with their addresses
within the time fixed by the court unless the list was previously filed. If the debtor fails to file the
list, the court may order the debtor or another entity to prepare and file it.
(b) DISMISSAL FOR FAILURE TO PAY FILING FEE.
(1) If any installment of the filing fee has not been paid, the court may, after a hearing on notice
to the debtor and the trustee, dismiss the case.
(2) If the case is dismissed or closed without full payment of the filing fee, the installments
collected shall be distributed in the same manner and proportions as if the filing fee had been paid
in full.
(c) DISMISSAL OF VOLUNTARY CHAPTER 7 OR CHAPTER 13 CASE FOR FAILURE TO
TIMELY FILE LIST OF CREDITORS, SCHEDULES, AND STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL
AFFAIRS. The court may dismiss a voluntary chapter 7 or chapter 13 case under §707(a)(3) or
§1307(c)(9) after a hearing on notice served by the United States trustee on the debtor, the trustee,
and any other entities as the court directs.
(d) SUSPENSION. The court shall not dismiss a case or suspend proceedings under §305 before a
hearing on notice as provided in Rule 2002(a).
(e) DISMISSAL OF AN INDIVIDUAL DEBTOR'S CHAPTER 7 CASE, OR CONVERSION TO
A CASE UNDER CHAPTER 11 OR 13, FOR ABUSE. The court may dismiss or, with the debtor's
consent, convert an individual debtor's case for abuse under §707(b) only on motion and after a
hearing on notice to the debtor, the trustee, the United States trustee, and any other entity as the court
directs.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in §704(b)(2), a motion to dismiss a case for abuse under
§707(b) or (c) may be filed only within 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors
under §341(a), unless, on request filed before the time has expired, the court for cause extends the
time for filing the motion to dismiss. The party filing the motion shall set forth in the motion all
matters to be considered at the hearing. In addition, a motion to dismiss under §707(b)(1) and (3)
shall state with particularity the circumstances alleged to constitute abuse.
(2) If the hearing is set on the court's own motion, notice of the hearing shall be served on the
debtor no later than 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under §341(a). The
notice shall set forth all matters to be considered by the court at the hearing.
(f) PROCEDURE FOR DISMISSAL, CONVERSION, OR SUSPENSION.
(1) Rule 9014 governs a proceeding to dismiss or suspend a case, or to convert a case to another
chapter, except under §§706(a), 1112(a), 1208(a) or (b), or 1307(a) or (b).
(2) Conversion or dismissal under §§706(a), 1112(a), 1208(b), or 1307(b) shall be on motion
filed and served as required by Rule 9013.
(3) A chapter 12 or chapter 13 case shall be converted without court order when the debtor files
a notice of conversion under §§1208(a) or 1307(a). The filing date of the notice becomes the date
of the conversion order for the purposes of applying §348(c) and Rule 1019. The clerk shall
[Release Point 118-106]
promptly transmit a copy of the notice to the United States trustee.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff.

Dec. 1, 2008.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a) of this rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 120(a). While the rule applies to
voluntary and involuntary cases, the "consent of the parties" referred to is that of petitioning creditors and the
debtor in an involuntary case. The last sentence recognizes that the court should not be confined to petitioning
creditors in its choice of parties on whom to call for assistance in preparing the list of creditors when the
debtor fails to do so. This subdivision implements §§303(j), 707, 1112 and 1307 of the Code by specifying the
manner of and persons to whom notice shall be given and requiring the court to hold a hearing on the issue of
dismissal.
Subdivision (b) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 120(b). A dismissal under this subdivision can
occur only when the petition has been permitted to be filed pursuant to Rule 1006(b). The provision for notice
in paragraph (3) is correlated with the provision in Rule 4006 when there is a waiver, denial, or revocation of a
discharge. As pointed out in the Note accompanying Rule 4008, the purpose of notifying creditors of a debtor
that no discharge has been granted is to correct their assumption to the contrary so that they can take
appropriate steps to protect their claims.
Subdivision (c) is new and specifies the notice required for a hearing on dismissal or suspension pursuant to
§305 of the Code. The suspension to which this subdivision refers is that of the case; it does not concern
abstention of the court in hearing an adversary proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1478(b).
Subdivision (d). Any proceeding, whether by a debtor or other party, to dismiss or convert a case under
§§706, 707, 1112, or 1307 is commenced by a motion pursuant to Rule 9014.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (d) is amended to provide that dismissal or conversion pursuant to §§706(a), 707(b), 1112(a),
and 1307(b) is not automatically a contested matter under Rule 9014. Conversion or dismissal under these
sections is initiated by the filing and serving of a motion as required by Rule 9013. No hearing is required on
these motions unless the court directs.
Conversion of a chapter 13 case to a chapter 7 case as authorized by §1307(a) is accomplished by the filing
of a notice of conversion. The notice of conversion procedure is modeled on the voluntary dismissal provision
of Rule 41(a)(1) F.R.Civ.P. Conversion occurs on the filing of the notice. No court order is required.
Subdivision (e) is new and provides the procedure to be followed when a court on its own motion has made
a preliminary determination that an individual debtor's chapter 7 case may be dismissed pursuant to §707(b) of
the Code, which was added by the 1984 amendments. A debtor's failure to attend the hearing is not a ground
for dismissal pursuant to §707(b).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to clarify that all entities required to receive notice under Rule 2002, including
but not limited to creditors, are entitled to the 20 day notice of the hearing to dismiss the case. The United
States trustee receives the notice pursuant to Rule 2002(k).
The word "petition" is changed to "case" in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) to conform to §§707, 930, 1112,
1208, and 1307.
Subdivision (d) is amended to conform to §348(c) of the Code which refers to the "conversion order."
Subdivisions (a) and (d) are amended to provide procedures for dismissal or conversion of a chapter 12
case. Procedures for dismissal or conversion under §1208(a) and (b) are the same as the procedures for
dismissal or conversion of a chapter 13 case under §1307(a) and (b).
Subdivision (e) is amended to conform to the 1986 amendment to §707(b) of the Code which permits the
United States trustee to make a motion to dismiss a case for substantial abuse. The time limit for such a
motion is added by this subdivision. In general, the facts that are the basis for a motion to dismiss under
§707(b) exist at the time the case is commenced and usually can be discovered early in the case by reviewing
the debtor's schedules and examining the debtor at the meeting of creditors. Since dismissal for substantial
abuse has the effect of denying the debtor a discharge in the chapter 7 case based on matters which may be
discovered early, a motion to dismiss under §707(b) is analogous to an objection to discharge pursuant to Rule
4004 and, therefore, should be required to be made within a specified time period. If matters relating to
substantial abuse are not discovered within the time period specified in subdivision (e) because of the debtor's
false testimony, refusal to obey a court order, fraudulent schedules or other fraud, and the debtor receives a
[Release Point 118-106]
discharge, the debtor's conduct may constitute the basis for revocation of the discharge under §727(d) and (e)
of the Code.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (d) is amended to clarify that the date of the filing of a notice of conversion in a chapter 12 or
chapter 13 case is treated as the date of the conversion order for the purpose of applying Rule 1019. Other
amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b)(3), which provides that notice of dismissal for failure to pay the filing fee shall be sent to all
creditors within 30 days after the dismissal, is deleted as unnecessary. Rule 2002(f) provides for notice to
creditors of the dismissal of a case.
Rule 2002(a) and this rule currently require notice to all creditors of a hearing on dismissal of a voluntary
chapter 7 case for the debtor's failure to file a list of creditors, schedules, and statement of financial affairs
within the time provided in §707(a)(3) of the Code. A new subdivision (c) is added to provide that the United
States trustee, who is the only entity with standing to file a motion to dismiss under §707(a)(3) or §1307(c)(9),
is required to serve the motion on only the debtor, the trustee, and any other entities as the court directs. This
amendment, and the amendment to Rule 2002, will have the effect of avoiding the expense of sending notices
of the motion to all creditors in a chapter 7 case.
New subdivision (f) is the same as current subdivision (d), except that it provides that a motion to suspend
all proceedings in a case or to dismiss a case for substantial abuse of chapter 7 under §707(b) is governed by
Rule 9014.
Other amendments to this rule are stylistic or for clarification.
GAP Report on Rule 1017. No changes since publication, except for stylistic changes in Rule 1017(e) and
(f).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2000 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to permit the court to grant a timely request filed by the United States trustee for an
extension of time to file a motion to dismiss a chapter 7 case under §707(b), whether the court rules on the
request before or after the expiration of the 60-day period.
Reporter's Note on Text of Rule 1017(e). The above text of Rule 1017(e) is not based on the text of the rule
in effect on this date. The above text embodies amendments that have been promulgated by the Supreme
Court in April 1999 and, unless Congress acts with respect to the amendments, will become effective on
December 1, 1999.
GAP Report on Rule 1017(e). No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (e) is amended to implement the 2005 amendments to §707 of the Code. These statutory
amendments permit conversion of a chapter 7 case to a case under chapter 11 or 13, change the basis for
dismissal or conversion from "substantial abuse" to "abuse," authorize parties other than the United States
trustee to bring motions under §707(b) under certain circumstances, and add §707(c) to create an explicit
ground for dismissal based on the request of a victim of a crime of violence or drug trafficking. The
conforming amendments to subdivision (e) preserve the time limits already in place for §707(b) motions,
except to the extent that §704(b)(2) sets the deadline for the United States trustee to act. In contrast to the
grounds for a motion to dismiss under §707(b)(2), which are quite specific, the grounds under §707(b)(1) and
(3) are very general. Therefore, to enable the debtor to respond, subdivision (e) requires that motions to
dismiss under §707(b)(1) and (3) state with particularity the circumstances alleged to constitute abuse.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
Rule 1018. Contested Involuntary Petitions; Contested Petitions Commencing
Chapter 15 Cases; Proceedings to Vacate Order for Relief; Applicability of
Rules in Part VII Governing Adversary Proceedings
Unless the court otherwise directs and except as otherwise prescribed in Part I of these rules, the
following rules in Part VII apply to all proceedings contesting an involuntary petition or a chapter 15
petition for recognition, and to all proceedings to vacate an order for relief: Rules 7005, 7008–7010,
7015, 7016, 7024–7026, 7028–7037, 7052, 7054, 7056, and 7062. The court may direct that other
[Release Point 118-106]
rules in Part VII shall also apply. For the purposes of this rule a reference in the Part VII rules to
adversary proceedings shall be read as a reference to proceedings contesting an involuntary petition
or a chapter 15 petition for recognition, or proceedings to vacate an order for relief. Reference in the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to the complaint shall be read as a reference to the petition.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 28, 2010, eff. Dec. 1, 2010.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
The rules in Part VII to which this rule refers are adaptations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the
purpose of governing the procedure in adversary proceedings in cases under the Code. See the Note
accompanying Rule 7001 infra. Because of the special need for dispatch and expedition in the determination
of the issues in an involuntary petition, see Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co., 222 U.S. 300, 309
(1911), the objective of some of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and their adaptations in Part VII to
facilitate the settlement of multiple controversies involving many persons in a single lawsuit is not compatible
with the exigencies of bankruptcy administration. See United States F. & G. Co. v. Bray, 225 U.S. 205, 218
(1912). For that reason Rules 7013, 7014 and 7018–7023 will rarely be appropriate in a proceeding on a
contested petition.
Certain terms used in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have altered meanings when they are made
applicable in cases under the Code by these rules. See Rule 9002 infra. This Rule 1018 requires that the terms
"adversary proceedings" when used in the rules in Part VII and "complaint" when used in the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure be given altered meanings when they are made applicable to proceedings relating to a
contested petition or proceedings to vacate any order for relief. A motion to vacate an order for relief, whether
or not made on a petition that was or could have been contested, is governed by the rules in Part VII referred
to in this Rule 1018.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Rule 1018 is amended to include within its terms a petition commencing an ancillary case when it is
contested. This provision was formerly included in Rule 1003(e)(4).
Although this rule does not contain an explicit authorization for the entry of an order for relief when a
debtor refuses to cooperate in discovery relating to a contested involuntary petition, the court has ample power
under Rule 37(b) F.R.Civ.P., as incorporated by Rule 7037, to enter an order for relief under appropriate
circumstances. Rule 37(b) authorizes the court to enter judgment by default or an order that "facts shall be
taken as established."
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2010 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to reflect the enactment of chapter 15 of the Code in 2005. As to chapter 15 cases, the
rule applies to contests over the petition for recognition and not to all matters that arise in the case. Thus,
proceedings governed by §1519(e) and §1521(e) of the Code must comply with Rules 7001(7) and 7065,
which provide that actions for injunctive relief are adversary proceedings governed by Part VII of the rules.
The rule is also amended to clarify that it applies to contests over an involuntary petition, and not to matters
merely "relating to" a contested involuntary petition. Matters that may arise in a chapter 15 case or an
involuntary case, other than contests over the petition itself, are governed by the otherwise applicable rules.
Other changes are stylistic.

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, referred to in text, are set out in the Appendix to Title 28, Judiciary
and Judicial Procedure.
Rule 1019. Conversion of a Chapter 11 Reorganization Case, Chapter 12 Family
Farmer's Debt Adjustment Case, or Chapter 13 Individual's Debt
Adjustment Case to a Chapter 7 Liquidation Case
When a chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case has been converted or reconverted to a chapter 7
case:
(1) Filing of Lists, Inventories, Schedules, Statements.
(A) Lists, inventories, schedules, and statements of financial affairs theretofore filed shall be
[Release Point 118-106]
deemed to be filed in the chapter 7 case, unless the court directs otherwise. If they have not
been previously filed, the debtor shall comply with Rule 1007 as if an order for relief had been
entered on an involuntary petition on the date of the entry of the order directing that the case
continue under chapter 7.
(B) If a statement of intention is required, it shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the
order of conversion or before the first date set for the meeting of creditors, whichever is earlier.
The court may grant an extension of time for cause only on written motion filed, or oral request
made during a hearing, before the time has expired. Notice of an extension shall be given to the
United States trustee and to any committee, trustee, or other party as the court may direct.
(2) New Filing Periods.
(A) A new time period for filing a motion under §707(b) or (c), a claim, a complaint
objecting to discharge, or a complaint to obtain a determination of dischargeability of any debt
shall commence under Rules 1 1017, 3002, 4004, or 4007, but a new time period shall not
commence if a chapter 7 case had been converted to a chapter 11, 12, or 13 case and thereafter
reconverted to a chapter 7 case and the time for filing a motion under §707(b) or (c), a claim, a
complaint objecting to discharge, or a complaint to obtain a determination of the
dischargeability of any debt, or any extension thereof, expired in the original chapter 7 case.
(B) A new time period for filing an objection to a claim of exemptions shall commence under
Rule 4003(b) after conversion of a case to chapter 7 unless:
(i) the case was converted to chapter 7 more than one year after the entry of the first order
confirming a plan under chapter 11, 12, or 13; or
(ii) the case was previously pending in chapter 7 and the time to object to a claimed
exemption had expired in the original chapter 7 case.
(3) Claims Filed Before Conversion. All claims actually filed by a creditor before conversion of
the case are deemed filed in the chapter 7 case.
(4) Turnover of Records and Property. After qualification of, or assumption of duties by the
chapter 7 trustee, any debtor in possession or trustee previously acting in the chapter 11, 12, or 13
case shall, forthwith, unless otherwise ordered, turn over to the chapter 7 trustee all records and
property of the estate in the possession or control of the debtor in possession or trustee.
(5) Filing Final Report and Schedule of Postpetition Debts.
(A) Conversion of Chapter 11 or Chapter 12 Case. Unless the court directs otherwise, if a
chapter 11 or chapter 12 case is converted to chapter 7, the debtor in possession or, if the debtor
is not a debtor in possession, the trustee serving at the time of conversion, shall:
(i) not later than 14 days after conversion of the case, file a schedule of unpaid debts
incurred after the filing of the petition and before conversion of the case, including the name
and address of each holder of a claim; and
(ii) not later than 30 days after conversion of the case, file and transmit to the United States
trustee a final report and account;
(B) Conversion of Chapter 13 Case. Unless the court directs otherwise, if a chapter 13 case is
converted to chapter 7,
(i) the debtor, not later than 14 days after conversion of the case, shall file a schedule of
unpaid debts incurred after the filing of the petition and before conversion of the case,
including the name and address of each holder of a claim; and
(ii) the trustee, not later than 30 days after conversion of the case, shall file and transmit to
the United States trustee a final report and account;
(C) Conversion After Confirmation of a Plan. Unless the court orders otherwise, if a chapter
11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case is converted to chapter 7 after confirmation of a plan, the
debtor shall file:
(i) a schedule of property not listed in the final report and account acquired after the filing
[Release Point 118-106]
of the petition but before conversion, except if the case is converted from chapter 13 to
chapter 7 and §348(f)(2) does not apply;
(ii) a schedule of unpaid debts not listed in the final report and account incurred after
confirmation but before the conversion; and
(iii) a schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases entered into or assumed after
the filing of the petition but before conversion.
(D) Transmission to United States Trustee. The clerk shall forthwith transmit to the United
States trustee a copy of every schedule filed pursuant to Rule 1019(5).
(6) Postpetition Claims; Preconversion Administrative Expenses; Notice. A request for payment
of an administrative expense incurred before conversion of the case is timely filed under §503(a)
of the Code if it is filed before conversion or a time fixed by the court. If the request is filed by a
governmental unit, it is timely if it is filed before conversion or within the later of a time fixed by
the court or 180 days after the date of the conversion. A claim of a kind specified in §348(d) may
be filed in accordance with Rules 3001(a)–(d) and 3002. Upon the filing of the schedule of unpaid
debts incurred after commencement of the case and before conversion, the clerk, or some other
person as the court may direct, shall give notice to those entities listed on the schedule of the time
for filing a request for payment of an administrative expense and, unless a notice of insufficient
assets to pay a dividend is mailed in accordance with Rule 2002(e), the time for filing a claim of a
kind specified in §348(d).

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 122 and implements §348 of the Code. The rule applies
to proceedings in a chapter 7 case following supersession of a case commenced under chapter 11 or 13,
whether the latter was initiated by an original petition or was converted from a pending chapter 7 or another
chapter case. The rule is not intended to invalidate any action taken in the superseded case before its
conversion to chapter 7.
Paragraph (1): If requirements applicable in the superseded case respecting the filing of schedules of debts
and property, or lists of creditors and inventory, and of statements of financial affairs have been complied with
before the order directing conversion to liquidation, these documents will ordinarily provide all the
information about the debts, property, financial affairs, and contracts of the debtor needed for the
administration of the estate. If the information submitted in the superseded case is inadequate for the purposes
of administration, however, the court may direct the preparation of further informational material and the
manner and time of its submission pursuant to paragraph (1). If no schedules, lists, inventories, or statements
were filed in the superseded case, this paragraph imposes the duty on the debtor to file schedules and a
statement of affairs pursuant to Rule 1007 as if an involuntary petition had been filed on the date when the
court directed the conversion of the case to a liquidation case.
Paragraphs (2) and (3). Paragraph (2) requires notice to be given to all creditors of the order of conversion.
The notice is to be included in the notice of the meeting of creditors and Official Form No. 16 may be adapted
for use. A meeting of creditors may have been held in the superseded case as required by §341(a) of the Code
but that would not dispense with the need to hold one in the ensuing liquidation case. Section 701(a) of the
Code permits the court to appoint the trustee acting in the chapter 11 or 13 case as interim trustee in the
chapter 7 case. Section 702(a) of the Code allows creditors to elect a trustee but only at the meeting of
creditors held under §341. The right to elect a trustee is not lost because the chapter 7 case follows a chapter
11 or 13 case. Thus a meeting of creditors is necessary. The date fixed for the meeting of creditors will control
at least the time for filing claims pursuant to Rule 3002(c). That time will remain applicable in the ensuing
chapter 7 case except as paragraph (3) provides, if that time had expired in an earlier chapter 7 case which was
converted to the chapter 11 or 13 case, it is not revived in the subsequent chapter 7 case. The same is true if
the time for filing a complaint objecting to discharge or to determine nondischargeability of a debt had
expired. Paragraph (3), however, recognizes that such time may be extended by the court under Rule 4004 or
4007 on motion made within the original prescribed time.
Paragraph (4) renders it unnecessary to file anew claims that had been filed in the chapter 11 or 13 case
[Release Point 118-106]
before conversion to chapter 7.
Paragraph (5) contemplates that typically, after the court orders conversion of a chapter case to liquidation,
a trustee under chapter 7 will forthwith take charge of the property of the estate and proceed expeditiously to
liquidate it. The court may appoint the interim trustee in the chapter 7 case pursuant to §701(a) of the Code. If
creditors do not elect a trustee under §702, the interim trustee becomes the trustee.
Paragraph (6) requires the trustee or debtor in possession acting in the chapter 11 or 13 case to file a final
report and schedule of debts incurred in that case. This schedule will provide the information necessary for
giving the notice required by paragraph (7) of the rule.
Paragraph (7) requires that claims that arose in the chapter 11 or 13 case be filed within 60 days after entry
of the order converting the case to one under chapter 7. Claims not scheduled pursuant to paragraph (6) of the
rule or arising from the rejection of an executory contract entered into during the chapter case may be filed
within a time fixed by the court. Pursuant to §348(c) of the Code, the conversion order is treated as the order
for relief to fix the time for the trustee to assume or reject executory contracts under §365(d).
Paragraph (8) permits the extension of the time for filing claims when claims are not timely filed but only
with respect to any surplus that may remain in the estate. See also §726(a)(2)(C) and (3) of the Code.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Paragraph (1) is amended to provide for the filing of a statement of intention in a case converted to chapter
7. Paragraph (1)(B) is added to provide for the filing of the statement of intention when a case is converted to
chapter 7. The time for filing the statement of intention and for an extension of that time is governed by
§521(2)(A) of the Code. An extension of time for other required filings is governed by Rule 1007(c), which
paragraph (1)(A) incorporates by reference. Because of the amendment to Rule 1007(c), the filing of new lists,
schedules, and statements is now governed exclusively by Rule 1019(1).
Paragraph (3) of the rule is expanded to include the effect of conversion of a chapter 11 or 13 case to a
chapter 7 case. On conversion of a case from chapter 11 or 13 to a chapter 7 case, parties have a new period
within which to file claims or complaints relating to the granting of the discharge or the dischargeability of a
debt. This amendment is consistent with the holding and reasoning of the court in F & M Marquette Nat'l
Bank v. Richards, 780 F.2d 24 (8th Cir. 1985).
Paragraph (4) is amended to deal directly with the status of claims which are properly listed on the
schedules filed in a chapter 11 case and deemed filed pursuant to §1111(a) of the Code. Section 1111(a) is
only applicable to the chapter 11 case. On conversion of the chapter 11 case to a chapter 7 case, paragraph (4)
governs the status of claims filed in the chapter 11 case. The Third Circuit properly construed paragraph (4) as
applicable to claims deemed filed in the superseded chapter 11 case. In re Crouthamel Potato Chip Co., 786
F.2d 141 (3d Cir. 1986).
The amendment to paragraph (4) changes that result by providing that only claims that are actually filed in
the chapter 11 case are treated as filed in the superseding chapter 7 case. When chapter 11 cases are converted
to chapter 7 cases, difficulties in obtaining and verifying the debtors' records are common. It is unfair to the
chapter 7 trustee and creditors to require that they be bound by schedules which may not be subject to
verification.
Paragraph (6) is amended to place the obligation on the chapter 13 debtor to file a schedule of unpaid debts
incurred during the superseded chapter 13 case.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to include conversion of a case from chapter 12 to chapter 7 and to implement the
United States trustee system.
The amendments to paragraph (1)(A) are stylistic. Reference to the statement of executory contracts is
deleted to conform to the amendment to Rule 1007(b)(1) which changes the statement to a schedule of
executory contracts and unexpired leases.
Paragraph (1)(B) is amended to enable the United States trustee to monitor the progress of the case and to
take appropriate action to enforce the debtor's obligation to perform the statement of intention in a timely
manner.
Paragraph (2) is deleted because notice of conversion of the case is required by Rules 1017(d), 2002(f)(2),
and 9022. The United States trustee, who supervises trustees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §586(a), may give notice
of the conversion to the trustee in the superseded case.
Paragraph (6), renumbered as paragraph (5), is amended to reduce to 15 days the time for filing a schedule
of postpetition debts and requires inclusion of the name and address of each creditor in connection with the
postpetition debt. These changes will enable the clerk to send postpetition creditors a timely notice of the
meeting of creditors held pursuant to §341(a) of the Code. The amendments to this paragraph also provide the
United States trustee with the final report and account of the superseded case, and with a copy of every
[Release Point 118-106]
schedule filed after conversion of the case. Conversion to chapter 7 terminates the service of the trustee in the
superseded case pursuant to §348(e) of the Code. Sections 704(a)(9), 1106(a)(1), 1107(a), 1202(b)(1), 1203
and 1302(b)(1) of the Code require the trustee or debtor in possession to file a final report and account with
the court and the United States trustee. The words "with the court" are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules
5005(a) and 9001(3).
Paragraph (7), renumbered as paragraph (6), is amended to conform the time for filing postpetition claims
to the time for filing prepetition claims pursuant to paragraph (3) (renumbered as paragraph (2)) of this rule
and Rule 3002(c). This paragraph is also amended to eliminate the need for a court order to provide notice of
the time for filing claims. It is anticipated that this notice will be given together with the notice of the meeting
of creditors. It is amended further to avoid the need to fix a time for filing claims arising under §365(d) if it is
a no asset case upon conversion. If assets become available for distribution, the court may fix a time for filing
such claims pursuant to Rule 3002(c)(4).
The additions of references to unexpired leases in paragraph (1)(A) and in paragraphs (6) and (7)
(renumbered as paragraphs (5) and (6)) are technical amendments to clarify that unexpired leases are included
as well as other executory contracts.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1996 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (7) is abrogated to conform to the abrogation of Rule 3002(c)(6).
GAP Report on Rule 1019. No changes were made to the text of the rule. The Committee Note was changed
to conform to the proposed changes to Rule 3002 (see GAP Report on Rule 3002 below).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1997 AMENDMENT
The amendments to subdivisions (3) and (5) are technical corrections and stylistic changes. The phrase
"superseded case" is deleted because it creates the erroneous impression that conversion of a case results in a
new case that is distinct from the original case. Similarly, the phrase "original petition" is deleted because it
erroneously implies that there is a second petition with respect to a converted case. See §348 of the Code.
GAP Report on Rule 1019. No changes to the published draft.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
Paragraph (1)(B) is amended to clarify that a motion for an extension of time to file a statement of
intention must be made by written motion filed before the time expires, or by oral request made at a hearing
before the time expires.
Subdivision (6) is amended to provide that a holder of an administrative expense claim incurred after the
commencement of the case, but before conversion to chapter 7, is required to file a request for payment under
§503(a) within a time fixed by the court, rather than a proof of claim under §501 and Rules 3001(a)–(d) and
3002. The 180-day period applicable to governmental units is intended to conform to §502(b)(9) of the Code
and Rule 3002(c)(1). It is unnecessary for the court to fix a time for filing requests for payment if it appears
that there are not sufficient assets to pay preconversion administrative expenses. If a time for filing a request
for payment of an administrative expense is fixed by the court, it may be enlarged as provided in Rule
9006(b). If an administrative expense claimant fails to timely file the request, it may be tardily filed under
§503(a) if permitted by the court for cause.
The final sentence of Rule 1019(6) is deleted because it is unnecessary in view of the other amendments to
this paragraph. If a party has entered into a postpetition contract or lease with the trustee or debtor that
constitutes an administrative expense, a timely request for payment must be filed in accordance with this
paragraph and §503(b) of the Code. The time for filing a proof of claim in connection with the rejection of any
other executory contract or unexpired lease is governed by Rule 3002(c)(4).
The phrase "including the United States, any state, or any subdivision thereof" is deleted as unnecessary.
Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.
GAP Report on Rule 1019. The proposed amendments to Rule 1019(6) were changed to delete the deadline
for filing requests for payment of preconversion administrative expenses that would be applicable in all cases,
and to provide instead that the court may fix such a deadline. The committee note was revised to clarify that it
is not necessary for the court to fix a deadline where there are insufficient assets to pay preconversion
administrative expenses.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (2) is amended to include a new filing period for motions under §707(b) and (c) of the Code
when a case is converted to chapter 7. The establishment of a deadline for filing such motions is not intended
to express a position as to whether such motions are permitted under the Code.
Changes Made After Publication. The Committee Note was amended by adding the second sentence to the
[Release Point 118-106]
Note stating explicitly that the rule was not intended to take a position on whether motions to dismiss a case
under §707(b) and (c) are proper in a case that is converted from another chapter.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2010 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (2). Subdivision (2) is redesignated as subdivision (2)(A), and a new subdivision (2)(B) is
added to the rule. Subdivision (2)(B) provides that a new time period to object to a claim of exemption arises
when a case is converted to chapter 7 from chapter 11, 12, or 13. The new time period does not arise,
however, if the conversion occurs more than one year after the first order confirming a plan, even if the plan
was subsequently modified. A new objection period also does not arise if the case was previously pending
under chapter 7 and the objection period had expired in the prior chapter 7 case.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes since publication.
1 So in original. Probably should be "Rule".
Rule 1020. Chapter 11 Reorganization Case for Small Business Debtors
(a) SMALL BUSINESS DEBTOR DESIGNATION. In a voluntary chapter 11 case, the debtor
shall state in the petition whether the debtor is a small business debtor and, if so, whether the debtor
elects to have subchapter V of chapter 11 apply. In an involuntary chapter 11 case, the debtor shall
file within 14 days after entry of the order for relief a statement as to whether the debtor is a small
business debtor and, if so, whether the debtor elects to have subchapter V of chapter 11 apply. The
status of the case as a small business case or a case under subchapter V of chapter 11 shall be in
accordance with the debtor's statement under this subdivision, unless and until the court enters an
order finding that the debtor's statement is incorrect.
(b) OBJECTING TO DESIGNATION. The United States trustee or a party in interest may file an
objection to the debtor's statement under subdivision (a) no later than 30 days after the conclusion of
the meeting of creditors held under §341(a) of the Code, or within 30 days after any amendment to
the statement, whichever is later.
(c) PROCEDURE FOR OBJECTION OR DETERMINATION. Any objection or request for a
determination under this rule shall be governed by Rule 9014 and served on: the debtor; the debtor's
attorney; the United States trustee; the trustee; the creditors included on the list filed under Rule
1007(d) or, if a committee has been appointed under §1102(a)(3), the committee or its authorized
agent; and any other entity as the court directs.
(Added Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997; amended Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; Mar. 26, 2009,
eff. Dec. 1, 2009; Apr. 11, 2022, eff. Dec. 1, 2022.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1997
This rule is designed to implement §§1121(e) and 1125(f) that were added to the Code by the Bankruptcy
Reform Act of 1994.
GAP Report on Rule 1020. The phrase "or by a later date as the court, for cause, may fix" at the end of the
published draft was deleted. The general provisions on reducing or extending time periods under Rule 9006
will be applicable.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
[Release Point 118-106]
Under the Code, as amended in 2005, there are no longer any provisions permitting or requiring a small
business debtor to elect to be treated as a small business. Therefore, the election provisions in the rule are
eliminated.
The 2005 amendments to the Code include several provisions relating to small business cases under chapter
11. Section 101 includes definitions of "small business debtor" and "small business case." The purpose of the
new language in this rule is to provide a procedure for informing the parties, the United States trustee, and the
court of whether the debtor is a small business debtor, and to provide procedures for resolving disputes
regarding the proper characterization of the debtor. Because it is important to resolve such disputes early in
the case, a time limit for objecting to the debtor's self-designation is imposed. Rule 9006(b)(1), which governs
enlargement of time, is applicable to the time limits set forth in this rule.
An important factor in determining whether the debtor is a small business debtor is whether the United
States trustee has appointed a committee of unsecured creditors under §1102, and whether such a committee is
sufficiently active and representative. Subdivision (c), relating to the appointment and activity of a committee
of unsecured creditors, is designed to be consistent with the Code's definition of "small business debtor."
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended in response to the enactment of the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019
(SBRA), Pub. L. No. 116–54, 133 Stat. 1079. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to
be a debtor under subchapter V of chapter 11. The title and subdivision (a) of the rule are amended to include
that option and to require a small business debtor to state in its voluntary petition, or in a statement filed
within 14 days after the order for relief is entered in an involuntary case, whether it elects to proceed under
subchapter V. The rule does not address whether the court, on a case-by-case basis, may allow a debtor to
make an election to proceed under subchapter V after the times specified in subdivision (a) or, if it can, under
what conditions.
Former subdivision (c) of the rule is deleted because the existence or level of activity of a creditors'
committee is no longer a criterion for small-business-debtor status. The SBRA eliminated that portion of the
definition of "small business debtor" in §101(51D) of the Code.
Former subdivision (d) is redesignated as subdivision (c), and the list of entities to be served is revised to
reflect that in most small business and subchapter V cases there will not be a committee of creditors.
Rule 1021. Health Care Business Case
(a) HEALTH CARE BUSINESS DESIGNATION. Unless the court orders otherwise, if a petition
in a case under chapter 7, chapter 9, or chapter 11 states that the debtor is a health care business, the
case shall proceed as a case in which the debtor is a health care business.
(b) MOTION. The United States trustee or a party in interest may file a motion to determine
whether the debtor is a health care business. The motion shall be transmitted to the United States
trustee and served on: the debtor; the trustee; any committee elected under §705 or appointed under
§1102 of the Code or its authorized agent, or, if the case is a chapter 9 municipality case or a chapter
11 reorganization case and no committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed under §1102, the
creditors included on the list filed under Rule 1007(d); and any other entity as the court directs. The
motion shall be governed by Rule 9014.

COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008
[Release Point 118-106]
Section 101(27A) of the Code, added by the 2005 amendments, defines a health care business. This rule
provides procedures for designating the debtor as a health care business. The debtor in a voluntary case, or
petitioning creditors in an involuntary case, make that designation by checking the appropriate box on the
petition. The rule also provides procedures for resolving disputes regarding the status of the debtor as a health
care business.

Rule 2001. Appointment of Interim Trustee Before Order for Relief in a Chapter
7 Liquidation Case
(a) APPOINTMENT. At any time following the commencement of an involuntary liquidation case
and before an order for relief, the court on written motion of a party in interest may order the
appointment of an interim trustee under §303(g) of the Code. The motion shall set forth the necessity
for the appointment and may be granted only after hearing on notice to the debtor, the petitioning
creditors, the United States trustee, and other parties in interest as the court may designate.
(b) BOND OF MOVANT. An interim trustee may not be appointed under this rule unless the
movant furnishes a bond in an amount approved by the court, conditioned to indemnify the debtor
for costs, attorney's fee, expenses, and damages allowable under §303(i) of the Code.
(c) ORDER OF APPOINTMENT. The order directing the appointment of an interim trustee shall
state the reason the appointment is necessary and shall specify the trustee's duties.
(d) TURNOVER AND REPORT. Following qualification of the trustee selected under §702 of the
Code, the interim trustee, unless otherwise ordered, shall (1) forthwith deliver to the trustee all the
records and property of the estate in possession or subject to control of the interim trustee and, (2)
within 30 days thereafter file a final report and account.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 201. See also former Chapter X Rule 10–201. In
conformity with title 11 of the United States Code, this rule substitutes "interim trustee" for "receiver."
Subdivision (a) and (e) of Rule 201 are not included because the provisions contained therein are found in
detail in §303(g) of the Code, or they are inconsistent with §701 of the Code. Similarly, the provisions in Rule
201(d) relating to a debtor's counterbond are not included because of their presence in §303(g).
Subdivision (a) makes it clear that the court may not on its own motion order the appointment of an interim
trustee before an order for relief is entered. Appointment may be ordered only on motion of a party in interest.
Subdivision (b) requires those seeking the appointment of an interim trustee to furnish a bond. The bond
may be the same one required of petitioning creditors under §303(e) of the Code to indemnify the debtor for
damages allowed by the court under §303(i).
Subdivision (c) requires that the order specify which duties enumerated in §303(g) shall be performed by
the interim trustee. Reference should be made to Rule 2015 for additional duties required of an interim trustee
including keeping records and filing periodic reports with the court.
Subdivision (d) requires turnover of records and property to the trustee selected under §702 of the Code,
after qualification. That trustee may be the interim trustee who becomes the trustee because of the failure of
creditors to elect one under §702(d) or the trustee elected by creditors under §702(b), (c).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to conform to §303(g) of the Code which provides that the United States trustee
appoints the interim trustee. See Rule X–1003. This rule does not apply to the exercise by the court of the
power to act sua sponte pursuant to §105(a) of the Code.

Rule 2002. Notices to Creditors, Equity Security Holders, Administrators in
Foreign Proceedings, Persons Against Whom Provisional Relief is Sought in
Ancillary and Other Cross-Border Cases, United States, and United States
Trustee
(a) TWENTY-ONE-DAY NOTICES TO PARTIES IN INTEREST. Except as provided in
subdivisions (h), (i), (l), (p), and (q) of this rule, the clerk, or some other person as the court may
direct, shall give the debtor, the trustee, all creditors and indenture trustees at least 21 days' notice by
mail of:
(1) the meeting of creditors under §341 or §1104(b) of the Code, which notice, unless the court
orders otherwise, shall include the debtor's employer identification number, social security
number, and any other federal taxpayer identification number;
(2) a proposed use, sale, or lease of property of the estate other than in the ordinary course of
business, unless the court for cause shown shortens the time or directs another method of giving
notice;

of an agreement pursuant to Rule 4001(d), unless the court for cause shown directs that notice not
be sent;

debt adjustment case, the hearing on the dismissal of the case or the conversion of the case to
another chapter, unless the hearing is under §707(a)(3) or §707(b) or is on dismissal of the case for
failure to pay the filing fee;
(5) the time fixed to accept or reject a proposed modification of a plan;
(6) a hearing on any entity's request for compensation or reimbursement of expenses if the
request exceeds $1,000;

subdivision (l) of this rule, the clerk, or some other person as the court may direct, shall give the
debtor, the trustee, all creditors and indenture trustees not less than 28 days' notice by mail of the
time fixed (1) for filing objections and the hearing to consider approval of a disclosure statement or,
under §1125(f), to make a final determination whether the plan provides adequate information so that
a separate disclosure statement is not necessary; (2) for filing objections and the hearing to consider
confirmation of a chapter 9 or chapter 11 plan; and (3) for the hearing to consider confirmation of a
chapter 13 plan.
(c) CONTENT OF NOTICE.
(1) Proposed Use, Sale, or Lease of Property. Subject to Rule 6004, the notice of a proposed

place of any public sale, the terms and conditions of any private sale and the time fixed for filing
objections. The notice of a proposed use, sale, or lease of property, including real estate, is
sufficient if it generally describes the property. The notice of a proposed sale or lease of personally
identifiable information under §363(b)(1) of the Code shall state whether the sale is consistent
with any policy prohibiting the transfer of the information.
(2) Notice of Hearing on Compensation. The notice of a hearing on an application for
compensation or reimbursement of expenses required by subdivision (a)(6) of this rule shall
identify the applicant and the amounts requested.
(3) Notice of Hearing on Confirmation When Plan Provides for an Injunction. If a plan provides
for an injunction against conduct not otherwise enjoined under the Code, the notice required under

[Release Point 118-106]
proposes an injunction;
(B) describe briefly the nature of the injunction; and
(C) identify the entities that would be subject to the injunction.
(d) NOTICE TO EQUITY SECURITY HOLDERS. In a chapter 11 reorganization case, unless
otherwise ordered by the court, the clerk, or some other person as the court may direct, shall in the
manner and form directed by the court give notice to all equity security holders of (1) the order for
relief; (2) any meeting of equity security holders held pursuant to §341 of the Code; (3) the hearing
on the proposed sale of all or substantially all of the debtor's assets; (4) the hearing on the dismissal
or conversion of a case to another chapter; (5) the time fixed for filing objections to and the hearing
to consider approval of a disclosure statement; (6) the time fixed for filing objections to and the
hearing to consider confirmation of a plan; and (7) the time fixed to accept or reject a proposed
modification of a plan.
(e) NOTICE OF NO DIVIDEND. In a chapter 7 liquidation case, if it appears from the schedules
that there are no assets from which a dividend can be paid, the notice of the meeting of creditors may
include a statement to that effect; that it is unnecessary to file claims; and that if sufficient assets
become available for the payment of a dividend, further notice will be given for the filing of claims.
(f) OTHER NOTICES. Except as provided in subdivision (l) of this rule, the clerk, or some other
person as the court may direct, shall give the debtor, all creditors, and indenture trustees notice by

(1) the order for relief;
(2) the dismissal or the conversion of the case to another chapter, or the suspension of
proceedings under §305;
(3) the time allowed for filing claims pursuant to Rule 3002;

the Code as provided in Rule 4004;
(5) the time fixed for filing a complaint to determine the dischargeability of a debt pursuant to
§523 of the Code as provided in Rule 4007;
(6) the waiver, denial, or revocation of a discharge as provided in Rule 4006;

$1,500;
(9) a notice under Rule 5008 regarding the presumption of abuse;
(10) a statement under §704(b)(1) as to whether the debtor's case would be presumed to be an
abuse under §707(b); and
(11) the time to request a delay in the entry of the discharge under §§1141(d)(5)(C), 1228(f),
and 1328(h). Notice of the time fixed for accepting or rejecting a plan pursuant to Rule 3017(c)
shall be given in accordance with Rule 3017(d).
(g) ADDRESSING NOTICES.
(1) Notices required to be mailed under Rule 2002 to a creditor, indenture trustee, or equity
security holder shall be addressed as such entity or an authorized agent has directed in its last
request filed in the particular case. For the purposes of this subdivision—
(A) a proof of claim filed by a creditor or indenture trustee that designates a mailing address
constitutes a filed request to mail notices to that address, unless a notice of no dividend has been
given under Rule 2002(e) and a later notice of possible dividend under Rule 3002(c)(5) has not
been given; and
(B) a proof of interest filed by an equity security holder that designates a mailing address
constitutes a filed request to mail notices to that address.
(2) Except as provided in §342(f) of the Code, if a creditor or indenture trustee has not filed a
request designating a mailing address under Rule 2002(g)(1) or Rule 5003(e), the notices shall be
mailed to the address shown on the list of creditors or schedule of liabilities, whichever is filed
[Release Point 118-106]
later. If an equity security holder has not filed a request designating a mailing address under Rule
2002(g)(1) or Rule 5003(e), the notices shall be mailed to the address shown on the list of equity
security holders.
(3) If a list or schedule filed under Rule 1007 includes the name and address of a legal
representative of an infant or incompetent person, and a person other than that representative files
a request or proof of claim designating a name and mailing address that differs from the name and
address of the representative included in the list or schedule, unless the court orders otherwise,
notices under Rule 2002 shall be mailed to the representative included in the list or schedules and
to the name and address designated in the request or proof of claim.
(4) Notwithstanding Rule 2002(g)(1)–(3), an entity and a notice provider may agree that when
the notice provider is directed by the court to give a notice, the notice provider shall give the
notice to the entity in the manner agreed to and at the address or addresses the entity supplies to
the notice provider. That address is conclusively presumed to be a proper address for the notice.
The notice provider's failure to use the supplied address does not invalidate any notice that is
otherwise effective under applicable law.
(5) A creditor may treat a notice as not having been brought to the creditor's attention under
§342(g)(1) only if, prior to issuance of the notice, the creditor has filed a statement that designates
the name and address of the person or organizational subdivision of the creditor responsible for
receiving notices under the Code, and that describes the procedures established by the creditor to
cause such notices to be delivered to the designated person or subdivision.
(h) NOTICES TO CREDITORS WHOSE CLAIMS ARE FILED.
(1) Voluntary Case. In a voluntary chapter 7 case, chapter 12 case, or chapter 13 case, after 70
days following the order for relief under that chapter or the date of the order converting the case to
chapter 12 or chapter 13, the court may direct that all notices required by subdivision (a) of this
rule be mailed only to:
• the debtor;
• the trustee;
• all indenture trustees;
• creditors that hold claims for which proofs of claim have been filed; and
• creditors, if any, that are still permitted to file claims because an extension was granted
under Rule 3002(c)(1) or (c)(2).
(2) Involuntary Case. In an involuntary chapter 7 case, after 90 days following the order for
relief under that chapter, the court may direct that all notices required by subdivision (a) of this
rule be mailed only to:
• the debtor;
• the trustee;
• all indenture trustees;
• creditors that hold claims for which proofs of claim have been filed; and
• creditors, if any, that are still permitted to file claims because an extension was granted
under Rule 3002(c)(1) or (c)(2).
(3) Insufficient Assets. In a case where notice of insufficient assets to pay a dividend has been
given to creditors under subdivision (e) of this rule, after 90 days following the mailing of a notice
of the time for filing claims under Rule 3002(c)(5), the court may direct that notices be mailed
only to the entities specified in the preceding sentence.
(i) NOTICES TO COMMITTEES. Copies of all notices required to be mailed pursuant to this rule
shall be mailed to the committees elected under §705 or appointed under §1102 of the Code or to
their authorized agents. Notwithstanding the foregoing subdivisions, the court may order that notices
required by subdivision (a)(2), (3) and (6) of this rule be transmitted to the United States trustee and
be mailed only to the committees elected under §705 or appointed under §1102 of the Code or to
[Release Point 118-106]
their authorized agents and to the creditors and equity security holders who serve on the trustee or
debtor in possession and file a request that all notices be mailed to them. A committee appointed
under §1114 shall receive copies of all notices required by subdivisions (a)(1), (a)(5), (b), (f)(2), and
(f)(7), and such other notices as the court may direct.
(j) NOTICES TO THE UNITED STATES. Copies of notices required to be mailed to all creditors
under this rule shall be mailed (1) in a chapter 11 reorganization case, to the Securities and Exchange
Commission at any place the Commission designates, if the Commission has filed either a notice of
appearance in the case or a written request to receive notices; (2) in a commodity broker case, to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission at Washington, D.C.; (3) in a chapter 11 case, to the
Internal Revenue Service at its address set out in the register maintained under Rule 5003(e) for the
district in which the case is pending; (4) if the papers in the case disclose a debt to the United States
other than for taxes, to the United States attorney for the district in which the case is pending and to
the department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States through which the debtor became
indebted; or (5) if the filed papers disclose a stock interest of the United States, to the Secretary of
the Treasury at Washington, D.C.
(k) NOTICES TO UNITED STATES TRUSTEE. Unless the case is a chapter 9 municipality case
or unless the United States trustee requests otherwise, the clerk, or some other person as the court
may direct, shall transmit to the United States trustee notice of the matters described in subdivisions
(a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(8), (a)(9), (b), (f)(1), (f)(2), (f)(4), (f)(6), (f)(7), (f)(8), and (q) of this rule
and notice of hearings on all applications for compensation or reimbursement of expenses. Notices to
the United States trustee shall be transmitted within the time prescribed in subdivision (a) or (b) of
this rule. The United States trustee shall also receive notice of any other matter if such notice is
requested by the United States trustee or ordered by the court. Nothing in these rules requires the
clerk or any other person to transmit to the United States trustee any notice, schedule, report,
application or other document in a case under the Securities Investor Protection Act, 15 U.S.C.
§78aaa et. 1 seq.
(l) NOTICE BY PUBLICATION. The court may order notice by publication if it finds that notice
by mail is impracticable or that it is desirable to supplement the notice.
(m) ORDERS DESIGNATING MATTER OF NOTICES. The court may from time to time enter
orders designating the matters in respect to which, the entity to whom, and the form and manner in
which notices shall be sent except as otherwise provided by these rules.
(n) CAPTION. The caption of every notice given under this rule shall comply with Rule 1005.
The caption of every notice required to be given by the debtor to a creditor shall include the
information required to be in the notice by §342(c) of the Code.
(o) NOTICE OF ORDER FOR RELIEF IN CONSUMER CASE. In a voluntary case commenced
by an individual debtor whose debts are primarily consumer debts, the clerk or some other person as
the court may direct shall give the trustee and all creditors notice by mail of the order for relief
within 21 days from the date thereof.
(p) NOTICE TO A CREDITOR WITH A FOREIGN ADDRESS.
(1) If, at the request of the United States trustee or a party in interest, or on its own initiative, the
court finds that a notice mailed within the time prescribed by these rules would not be sufficient to
give a creditor with a foreign address to which notices under these rules are mailed reasonable
notice under the circumstances, the court may order that the notice be supplemented with notice
by other means or that the time prescribed for the notice by mail be enlarged.
(2) Unless the court for cause orders otherwise, a creditor with a foreign address to which
notices under this rule are mailed shall be given at least 30 days' notice of the time fixed for filing
a proof of claim under Rule 3002(c) or Rule 3003(c).
(3) Unless the court for cause orders otherwise, the mailing address of a creditor with a foreign
address shall be determined under Rule 2002(g).
(q) NOTICE OF PETITION FOR RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN PROCEEDING AND OF
COURT'S INTENTION TO COMMUNICATE WITH FOREIGN COURTS AND FOREIGN
REPRESENTATIVES.
[Release Point 118-106]
(1) Notice of Petition for Recognition. After the filing of a petition for recognition of a foreign
proceeding, the court shall promptly schedule and hold a hearing on the petition. The clerk, or
some other person as the court may direct, shall forthwith give the debtor, all persons or bodies
authorized to administer foreign proceedings of the debtor, all entities against whom provisional
relief is being sought under §1519 of the Code, all parties to litigation pending in the United States
in which the debtor is a party at the time of the filing of the petition, and such other entities as the
court may direct, at least 21 days' notice by mail of the hearing. The notice shall state whether the
petition seeks recognition as a foreign main proceeding or foreign nonmain proceeding and shall
include the petition and any other document the court may require. If the court consolidates the
hearing on the petition with the hearing on a request for provisional relief, the court may set a
shorter notice period, with notice to the entities listed in this subdivision.
(2) Notice of Court's Intention to Communicate with Foreign Courts and Foreign
Representatives. The clerk, or some other person as the court may direct, shall give the debtor, all
persons or bodies authorized to administer foreign proceedings of the debtor, all entities against
whom provisional relief is being sought under §1519 of the Code, all parties to litigation pending
in the United States in which the debtor is a party at the time of the filing of the petition, and such
other entities as the court may direct, notice by mail of the court's intention to communicate with a
foreign court or foreign representative.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Some of the notices required by this rule may be given either by the clerk or as the court may otherwise
direct. For example, the court may order the trustee or debtor in possession to transmit one or more of the
notices required by this rule, such as, notice of a proposed sale of property. See §363(b) of the Code. When
publication of notices is required or desirable, reference should be made to Rule 9008.
Notice of the order for relief is required to be given by §342 of the Code and by subdivision (f)(1) of this
rule. That notice may be combined with the notice of the meeting of creditors as indicated in Official Form
No. 16, the notice and order of the meeting of creditors.
Subdivision (a) sets forth the requirement that 20 days notice be given of the significant events in a case
under the Bankruptcy Code. The former Act and Rules provided a ten day notice in bankruptcy and Chapter
XI cases, and a 20 day notice in a Chapter X case. This rule generally makes uniform the 20 day notice
provision except that subdivision (b) contains a 25 day period for certain events in a chapter 9, 11, or 13 case.
Generally, Rule 9006 permits reduction of time periods. Since notice by mail is complete on mailing, the
requirement of subdivision (a) is satisfied if the notices are deposited in the mail at least 20 days before the
event. See Rule 9006(e). The exceptions referred to in the introductory phrase include the modifications in the
notice procedure permitted by subdivision (h) as to non-filing creditors, subdivision (i) as to cases where a
committee is functioning, and subdivision (k) where compliance with subdivision (a) is impracticable.
The notice of a proposed sale affords creditors an opportunity to object to the sale and raise a dispute for the
court's attention. Section 363(b) of the Code permits the trustee or debtor in possession to sell property, other
than in the ordinary course of business, only after notice and hearing. If no objection is raised after notice,
§102(1) provides that there need not be an actual hearing. Thus, absent objection, there would be no court
involvement with respect to a trustee's sale. Once an objection is raised, only the court may pass on it.
Prior to the Code the court could shorten the notice period for a proposed sale of property or dispense with
notice. This subdivision (a), permits the 20 day period to be shortened in appropriate circumstances but the
rule does not contain a provision allowing the court to dispense with notice. The rule is thus consistent with
the Code, §§363(b) and 102(1)(A) of the Code. See 28 U.S.C. §2075. It may be necessary, in certain
circumstances, however, to use a method of notice other than mail. Subdivision (a)(2) vests the court with
discretion, on cause shown, to order a different method. Reference should also be made to Rule 6004 which
allows a different type of notice of proposed sales when the property is of little value.
Notice of the hearing on an application for compensation or reimbursement of expenses totalling $100 or
[Release Point 118-106]
less need not be given. In chapter 13 cases relatively small amounts are sometimes allowed for
post-confirmation services and it would not serve a useful purpose to require advance notice.
Subdivision (b) is similar to subdivision (a) but lengthens the notice time to 25 days with respect to those
events particularly significant in chapter 9, 11 and 13 cases. The additional time may be necessary to
formulate objections to a disclosure statement or confirmation of a plan and preparation for the hearing on
approval of the disclosure statement or confirmation. The disclosure statement and hearing thereon is only
applicable in chapter 9 cases (§901(a) of the Code), and chapter 11 cases (§1125 of the Code).
Subdivision (c) specifies certain matters that should be included in the notice of a proposed sale of property
and notice of the hearing on an application for allowances. Rule 6004 fixes the time within which parties in
interest may file objections to a proposed sale of property.
Subdivision (d) relates exclusively to the notices given to equity security holders in chapter 11 cases. Under
chapter 11, a plan may impair the interests of the debtor's shareholders or a plan may be a relatively simple
restructuring of unsecured debt. In some cases, it is necessary that equity interest holders receive various
notices and in other cases there is no purpose to be served. This subdivision indicates that the court is not
mandated to order notices but rather that the matter should be treated with some flexibility. The court may
decide whether notice is to be given and how it is to be given. Under §341(b) of the Code, a meeting of equity
security holders is not required in each case, only when it is ordered by the court. Thus subdivision (d)(2)
requires notice only when the court orders a meeting.
In addition to the notices specified in this subdivision, there may be other events or matters arising in a case
as to which equity security holders should receive notice. These are situations left to determination by the
court.
Subdivision (e), authorizing a notice of the apparent insufficiency of assets for the payment of any dividend,
is correlated with Rule 3002(c)(5), which provides for the issuance of an additional notice to creditors if the
possibility of a payment later materializes.
Subdivision (f) provides for the transmission of other notices to which no time period applies. Clause (1)
requires notice of the order for relief; this complements the mandate of §342 of the Code requiring such notice
as is appropriate of the order for relief. This notice may be combined with the notice of the meeting of
creditors to avoid the necessity of more than one mailing. See Official Form No. 16, notice of meeting of
creditors.
Subdivision (g) recognizes that an agent authorized to receive notices for a creditor may, without a court
order, designate where notices to the creditor he represents should be addressed. Agent includes an officer of a
corporation, an attorney at law, or an attorney in fact if the requisite authority has been given him. It should be
noted that Official Forms Nos. 17 and 18 do not include an authorization of the holder of a power of attorney
to receive notices for the creditor. Neither these forms nor this rule carries any implication that such an
authorization may not be given in a power of attorney or that a request for notices to be addressed to both the
creditor or his duly authorized agent may not be filed.
Subdivision (h). After the time for filing claims has expired in a chapter 7 case, creditors who have not filed
their claims in accordance with Rule 3002(c) are not entitled to share in the estate except as they may come
within the special provisions of §726 of the Code or Rule 3002(c)(6). The elimination of notice to creditors
who have no recognized stake in the estate may permit economies in time and expense. Reduction of the list
of creditors to receive notices under this subdivision is discretionary. This subdivision does not apply to the
notice of the meeting of creditors.
Subdivision (i) contains a list of matters of which notice may be given a creditors' committee or to its
authorized agent in lieu of notice to the creditors. Such notice may serve every practical purpose of a notice to
all the creditors and save delay and expense. In re Schulte-United, Inc., 59 F.2d 553, 561 (8th Cir. 1932).
Subdivision (j). The premise for the requirement that the district director of internal revenue receive copies
of notices that all creditors receive in a chapter 11 case is that every debtor is potentially a tax debtor of the
United States. Notice to the district director alerts him to the possibility that a tax debtor's estate is about to be
liquidated or reorganized and that the debtor may be discharged. When other indebtedness to the United States
is indicated, the United States attorney is notified as the person in the best position to protect the interests of
the government. In addition, the provision requires notice by mail to the head of any department, agency, or
instrumentality of the United States through whose action the debtor became indebted to the United States.
This rule is not intended to preclude a local rule from requiring a state or local tax authority to receive some or
all of the notices to creditors under these rules.
Subdivision (k) specifies two kinds of situations in which notice by publication may be appropriate: (1)
when notice by mail is impracticable; and (2) when notice by mail alone is less than adequate. Notice by mail
may be impracticable when, for example, the debtor has disappeared or his records have been destroyed and
the names and addresses of his creditors are unavailable, or when the number of creditors with nominal claims
[Release Point 118-106]
is very large and the estate to be distributed may be insufficient to defray the costs of issuing the notices.
Supplementing notice by mail is also indicated when the debtor's records are incomplete or inaccurate and it is
reasonable to believe that publication may reach some of the creditors who would otherwise be missed. Rule
9008 applies when the court directs notice by publication under this rule. Neither clause (2) of subdivision (a)
nor subdivision (k) of this rule is concerned with the publication of advertisement to the general public of a
sale of property of the estate at public auction under Rule 6004(b). See 3 Collier, Bankruptcy 522–23 (14th ed.
1971); 4B id. 1165–67 (1967); 2 id. 363.03 (15th ed. 1981).
Subdivision (m). Inclusion in notices to creditors of information as to other names used by the debtor as
required by Rule 1005 will assist them in the preparation of their proofs of claim and in deciding whether to
file a complaint objecting to the debtor's discharge. Additional names may be listed by the debtor on his
statement of affairs when he did not file the petition. The mailing of notices should not be postponed to await
a delayed filing of the statement of financial affairs.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to provide that notice of a hearing on an application for compensation must be
given only when the amount requested is in excess of $500.
Subdivision (d). A new notice requirement is added as clause (3). When a proposed sale is of all or
substantially all of the debtor's assets, it is appropriate that equity security holders be given notice of the
proposed sale. The clauses of subdivision (d) are renumbered to accommodate this addition.
Subdivision (f). Clause (7) is eliminated. Mailing of a copy of the discharge order is governed by Rule
4004(g).
Subdivision (g) is amended to relieve the clerk of the duty to mail notices to the address shown in a proof of
claim when a notice of no dividend has been given pursuant to Rule 2002. This amendment avoids the
necessity of the clerk searching proofs of claim which are filed in no dividend cases to ascertain whether a
different address is shown.
Subdivision (n) was enacted by §321 of the 1984 amendments.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a)(3) is amended to exclude compromise or settlement agreements concerning adequate
protection or which modify or terminate the automatic stay, provide for use of cash collateral, or create a
senior or equal lien on collateral to obtain credit. Notice requirements relating to approval of such agreements
are governed by Rule 4001(d).
Subdivision (a)(5) is amended to include a hearing on dismissal or conversion of a chapter 12 case. This
subdivision does not apply when a hearing is not required. It is also amended to avoid the necessity of giving
notice to all creditors of a hearing on the dismissal of a consumer debtor's case based on substantial abuse of
chapter 7. Such hearings on dismissal under §707(b) of the Code are governed by Rule 1017(e).
Subdivision (a)(9) is added to provide for notice of the time fixed for filing objections and the hearing to
consider confirmation of a plan in a chapter 12 case. Section 1224 of the Code requires "expedited notice" of
the confirmation hearing in a chapter 12 case and requires that the hearing be concluded not later than 45 days
after the filing of the plan unless the time is extended for cause. This amendment establishes 20 days as the
notice period. The court may shorten this time on its own motion or on motion of a party in interest. The
notice includes both the date of the hearing and the date for filing objections, and must be accompanied by a
copy of the plan or a summary of the plan in accordance with Rule 3015(d).
Subdivision (b) is amended to delete as unnecessary the references to subdivisions (h) and (i).
Subdivision (d) does not require notice to equity security holders in a chapter 12 case. The procedural
burden of requiring such notice is outweighed by the likelihood that all equity security holders of a family
farmer will be informed of the progress of the case without formal notice. Subdivision (d) is amended to
recognize that the United States trustee may convene a meeting of equity security holders pursuant to §341(b).
Subdivision (f)(2) is amended and subdivision (f)(4) is deleted to require notice of any conversion of the
case, whether the conversion is by court order or is effectuated by the debtor filing a notice of conversion
pursuant to §§1208(a) or 1307(a). Subdivision (f)(8), renumbered (f)(7), is amended to include entry of an
order confirming a chapter 12 plan. Subdivision (f)(9) is amended to increase the amount to $1,500.
Subdivisions (g) and (j) are amended to delete the words "with the court" and subdivision (i) is amended to
delete the words "with the clerk" because these phrases are unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
Subdivision (i) is amended to require that the United States trustee receive notices required by subdivision
(a)(2), (3) and (7) of this rule notwithstanding a court order limiting such notice to committees and to creditors
and equity security holders who request such notices. Subdivision (i) is amended further to include
committees elected pursuant to §705 of the Code and to provide that committees of retired employees
appointed in chapter 11 cases receive certain notices.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subdivision (k) is derived from Rule X–1008. The administrative functions of the United States trustee
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §586(a) and standing to be heard on issues under §307 and other sections of the Code
require that the United States trustee be informed of developments and issues in every case except chapter 9
cases. The rule omits those notices described in subdivision (a)(1) because a meeting of creditors is convened
only by the United States trustee, and those notices described in subdivision (a)(4) (date fixed for filing claims
against a surplus), subdivision (a)(6) (time fixed to accept or reject proposed modification of a plan),
subdivision (a)(8) (time fixed for filing proofs of claims in chapter 11 cases), subdivision (f)(3) (time fixed for
filing claims in chapter 7, 12, and 13 cases), and subdivision (f)(5) (time fixed for filing complaint to
determine dischargeability of debt) because these notices do not relate to matters that generally involve the
United States trustee. Nonetheless, the omission of these notices does not prevent the United States trustee
from receiving such notices upon request. The United States trustee also receives notice of hearings on
applications for compensation or reimbursement without regard to the $500 limitation contained in
subdivision (a)(7) of this rule. This rule is intended to be flexible in that it permits the United States trustee in
a particular judicial district to request notices in certain categories, and to request not to receive notices in
other categories, when the practice in that district makes that desirable.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (j) is amended to avoid the necessity of sending an additional notice to the Washington, D.C.
address of the Securities and Exchange Commission if the Commission prefers to have notices sent only to a
local office. This change also clarifies that notices required to be mailed pursuant to this rule must be sent to
the Securities and Exchange Commission only if it has filed a notice of appearance or has filed a written
request. Other amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1996 AMENDMENT
Paragraph (a)(4) is abrogated to conform to the abrogation of Rule 3002(c)(6). The remaining paragraphs
of subdivision (a) are renumbered, and references to these paragraphs contained in other subdivisions of this
rule are amended accordingly.
Paragraph (f)(8) is amended so that a summary of the trustee's final account, which is prepared after
distribution of property, does not have to be mailed to the debtor, all creditors, and indenture trustees in a
chapter 7 case. Parties are sufficiently protected by receiving a summary of the trustee's final report that
informs parties of the proposed distribution of property.
Subdivision (h) is amended (1) to provide that an order under this subdivision may not be issued if a notice
of no dividend is given pursuant to Rule 2002(e) and the time for filing claims has not expired as provided in
Rule 3002(c)(5); (2) to clarify that notices required to be mailed by subdivision (a) to parties other than
creditors must be mailed to those entities despite an order issued pursuant to subdivision (h); (3) to provide
that if the court, pursuant to Rule 3002(c)(1) or 3002(c)(2), has granted an extension of time to file a proof of
claim, the creditor for whom the extension has been granted must continue to receive notices despite an order
issued pursuant to subdivision (h); and (4) to delete references to subdivision (a)(4) and Rule 3002(c)(6),
which have been abrogated.
Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.
GAP Report on Rule 2002. No changes since publication, except for stylistic changes and the correction of
a typographical error in the committee note.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1997 AMENDMENT
Paragraph (a)(1) is amended to include notice of a meeting of creditors convened under §1104(b) of the
Code for the purpose of electing a trustee in a chapter 11 case. The court for cause shown may order the
20-day period reduced pursuant to Rule 9006(c)(1).
Subdivision (n) is amended to conform to the 1994 amendment to §342 of the Code. As provided in
§342(c), the failure of a notice given by the debtor to a creditor to contain the information required by §342(c)
does not invalidate the legal effect of the notice.
GAP Report on Rule 2002. No changes to the published draft.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
Paragraph (a)(4) is amended to conform to the amendments to Rule 1017. If the United States trustee files
a motion to dismiss a case for the debtor's failure to file the list of creditors, schedules, or the statement of
financial affairs within the time specified in §707(a)(3), the amendments to this rule and to Rule 1017
eliminate the requirement that all creditors receive notice of the hearing.
Paragraph (a)(4) is amended further to conform to Rule 1017(b), which requires that notice of the hearing
on dismissal of a case for failure to pay the filing fee be served on only the debtor and the trustee.
[Release Point 118-106]
Paragraph (f)(2) is amended to provide for notice of the suspension of proceedings under §305.
GAP Report on Rule 2002. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2000 AMENDMENT
Paragraph (a)(6) is amended to increase the dollar amount from $500 to $1,000. The amount was last
amended in 1987, when it was changed from $100 to $500. The amendment also clarifies that the notice is
required only if a particular entity is requesting more than $1,000 as compensation or reimbursement of
expenses. If several professionals are requesting compensation or reimbursement, and only one hearing will be
held on all applications, notice under paragraph (a)(6) is required only with respect to the entities that have
requested more than $1,000. If each applicant requests $1,000 or less, notice under paragraph (a)(6) is not
required even though the aggregate amount of all applications to be considered at the hearing is more than
$1,000.
If a particular entity had filed prior applications or had received compensation or reimbursement of
expenses at an earlier time in the case, the amounts previously requested or awarded are not considered when
determining whether the present application exceeds $1,000 for the purpose of applying this rule.
GAP Report on Rule 2002(a). No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2001 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c)(3) is added to assure that parties given notice of a hearing to consider confirmation of a plan
under subdivision (b) are given adequate notice of an injunction provided for in the plan if it would enjoin
conduct that is not otherwise enjoined by operation of the Code. The validity and effect of any injunction
provided for in a plan are substantive law matters that are beyond the scope of these rules.
The notice requirement of subdivision (c)(3) is not applicable to an injunction contained in a plan if it is
substantially the same as an injunction provided under the Code. For example, if a plan contains an injunction
against acts to collect a discharged debt from the debtor, Rule 2002(c)(3) would not apply because that
conduct would be enjoined under §524(a)(2) upon the debtor's discharge. But if a plan provides that creditors
will be enjoined from asserting claims against persons who are not debtors in the case, the notice of the
confirmation hearing must include the information required under Rule 2002(c)(3) because that conduct
would not be enjoined by operation of the Code. See §524(e).
The requirement that the notice identify the entities that would be subject to the injunction requires only
reasonable identification under the circumstances. If the entities that would be subject to the injunction cannot
be identified by name, the notice may describe them by class or category if reasonable under the
circumstances. For example, it may be sufficient for the notice to identify the entities as "all creditors of the
debtor" and for the notice to be published in a manner that satisfies due process requirements.
Subdivision (g) has been revised to clarify that where a creditor or indenture trustee files both a proof of
claim which includes a mailing address and a separate request designating a mailing address, the last paper
filed determines the proper address. The amendments also clarify that a request designating a mailing address
is effective only with respect to a particular case.
Under Rule 2002(g), a duly filed proof of claim is considered a request designating a mailing address if a
notice of no dividend has been given under Rule 2002(e), but has been superseded by a subsequent notice of
possible dividend under Rule 3002(c)(5). A duly filed proof of interest is considered a request designating a
mailing address of an equity security holder.
Rule 2002(g)(3) is added to assure that notices to an infant or incompetent person under this rule are mailed
to the appropriate guardian or other legal representative. Under Rule 1007(m), if the debtor knows that a
creditor is an infant or incompetent person, the debtor is required to include in the list and schedule of
creditors the name and address of the person upon whom process would be served in an adversary proceeding
in accordance with Rule 7004(b)(2). If the infant or incompetent person, or another person, files a request or
proof of claim designating a different name and mailing address, the notices would have to be mailed to both
names and addresses until the court resolved the issue as to the proper mailing address.
The other amendments to Rule 2002(g) are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. In Rule 2002(c)(3), the word "highlighted" was replaced
with "underlined" because highlighted documents are difficult to scan electronically for inclusion in the clerks'
files. The Committee Note was revised to put in a more prominent position the statement that the validity and
effect of any injunction provided for in a plan are substantive matters beyond the scope of the rules.
In Rule 2002(g), no changes were made.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2003 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a)(1) of the rule is amended to direct the clerk or other person giving notice of the §341 or
§1104(b) meeting of creditors to include the debtor's full social security number on the notice. Official Form
[Release Point 118-106]
9, the form of the notice of the meeting of creditors that will become a part of the court's file in the case, will
include only the last four digits of the debtor's social security number. This rule, however, directs the clerk to
include the full social security number on the notice that is served on the creditors and other identified parties,
unless the court orders otherwise in a particular case. This will enable creditors and other parties in interest
who are in possession of the debtor's social security number to verify the debtor's identity and proceed
accordingly. The filed Official Form 9, however, will not include the debtor's full social security number. This
will prevent the full social security number from becoming a part of the court's file in the case, and the number
will not be included in the court's electronic records. Creditors who already have the debtor's social security
number will be able to verify the existence of a case under the debtor's social security number, but any person
searching the electronic case files without the number will not be able to acquire the debtor's social security
number.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The rule amendment was made in response to concerns of
both private creditors and taxing authorities that truncating the social security number of a debtor to the last
four digits would unduly hamper their ability to identify the debtor and govern their actions accordingly.
Therefore, the Advisory Committee amended Rule 2002 to require the clerk to include the debtor's full social
security number on the notice informing creditors of the §341 meeting and other significant deadlines in the
case. This is essentially a continuation of the practice under the current rules, and the amendment is necessary
because of the amendment to Rule 1005 that restricts publication of the social security number on the caption
of the petition to the final four digits of the number.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2004 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to reflect that the structure of the Internal Revenue Service no longer includes a
District Director. Thus, rather than sending notice to the District Director, the rule now requires that the
notices be sent to the location designated by the Service and set out in the register of addresses maintained by
the clerk under Rule 5003(e). The other change is stylistic.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2005 AMENDMENT
A new paragraph (g)(4) is inserted in the rule. The new paragraph authorizes an entity and a notice provider
to agree that the notice provider will give notices to the entity at the address or addresses set out in their
agreement. Rule 9001(9) sets out the definition of a notice provider.
The business of many entities is national in scope, and technology currently exists to direct the transmission
of notice (both electronically and in paper form) to those entities in an accurate and much more efficient
manner than by sending individual notices to the same creditor by separate mailings. The rule authorizes an
entity and a notice provider to determine the manner of the service as well as to set the address or addresses to
which the notices must be sent. For example, they could agree that all notices sent by the notice provider to
the entity must be sent to a single, nationwide electronic or postal address. They could also establish local or
regional addresses to which notices would be sent in matters pending in specific districts. Since the entity and
notice provider also can agree on the date of the commencement of service under the agreement, there is no
need to set a date in the rule after which notices would have to be sent to the address or addresses that the
entity establishes. Furthermore, since the entity supplies the address to the notice provider, use of that address
is conclusively presumed to be proper. Nonetheless, if that address is not used, the notice still may be effective
if the notice is otherwise effective under applicable law. This is the same treatment given under Rule 5003(e)
to notices sent to governmental units at addresses other than those set out in that register of addresses.
The remaining subdivisions of Rule 2002(g) continue to govern the addressing of a notice that is not sent
pursuant to an agreement described in Rule 2002(g)(4).
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is amended to provide for 25 days' notice of the time for the court to make a final
determination whether the plan in a small business case can serve as a disclosure statement. Conditional
approval of a disclosure statement in a small business case is governed by Rule 3017.1 and does not require 25
days' notice. The court may consider this matter in a hearing combined with the confirmation hearing in a
small business case.
Because of the requirements of Rule 6004(g), subdivision (c)(1) is amended to require that a trustee leasing
or selling personally identifiable information under §363(b)(1)(A) or (B) of the Code, as amended in 2005,
include in the notice of the lease or sale transaction a statement as to whether the lease or sale is consistent
with a policy prohibiting the transfer of the information.
Subdivisions (f)(9) and (10) are new. They reflect the 2005 amendments to §§342(d) and 704(b) of the
Code. Section 342(d) requires the clerk to give notice to creditors shortly after the commencement of the case
[Release Point 118-106]
as to whether a presumption of abuse exists. Subdivision (f)(9) adds this notice to the list of notices that the
clerk must give. Subdivision (f)(10) implements the amendment to §704(b), which requires the court to
provide a copy to all creditors of a statement by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator as to
whether the debtor's case would be presumed to be an abuse under §707(b) not later than five days after
receiving it.
Subdivision (f)(11) is also added to provide notice to creditors of the debtor's filing of a statement in a
chapter 11, 12, or 13 case that there is no reasonable cause to believe that §522(q) applies in the case. This
allows a creditor who disputes that assertion to request a delay of the entry of the discharge in the case.
Subdivision (g)(2) of the rule is amended because the 2005 amendments to §342(f) of the Code permit
creditors in chapter 7 and 13 individual debtor cases to file a notice with any bankruptcy court of the address
to which the creditor wishes all notices to be sent. The amendment to Rule 2002(g)(2) therefore only limits
application of the subdivision when a creditor files a notice under §342(f).
New subdivision (g)(5) implements §342(g)(1) which was added to the Code in 2005. Section 342(g)(1)
allows a creditor to treat a notice as not having been brought to the creditor's attention, and so potentially
ineffective, until it is received by a person or organizational subdivision that the creditor has designated to
receive notices under the Bankruptcy Code. Under that section, the creditor must have established reasonable
procedures for such notices to be delivered to the designated person or subdivision. The rule provides that, in
order to challenge a notice under §342(g)(1), a creditor must have filed the name and address of the
designated notice recipient, as well as a description of the procedures for directing notices to that recipient,
prior to the time that the challenged notice was issued. The filing required by the rule may be made as part of
a creditor's filing under §342(f), which allows a creditor to file a notice of the address to be used by all
bankruptcy courts or by particular bankruptcy courts to provide notice to the creditor in cases under chapters 7
and 13. Filing the name and address of the designated notice recipient and the procedures for directing notices
to that recipient will reduce uncertainty as to the proper party for receiving notice and limit factual disputes as
to whether a notice recipient has been designated and as to the nature of procedures adopted to direct notices
to the recipient.
Subdivision (k) is amended to add notices given under subdivision (q) to the list of notices which must be
served on the United States trustee.
Section 1514(d) of the Code, added by the 2005 amendments, requires that such additional time as is
reasonable under the circumstances be given to creditors with foreign addresses with respect to notices and the
filing of a proof of claim. Thus, subdivision (p)(1) is added to this rule to give the court flexibility to direct
that notice by other means shall supplement notice by mail, or to enlarge the notice period, for creditors with
foreign addresses. If cause exists, such as likely delays in the delivery of mailed notices in particular locations,
the court may order that notice also be given by email, facsimile, or private courier. Alternatively, the court
may enlarge the notice period for a creditor with a foreign address. It is expected that in most situations
involving foreign creditors, fairness will not require any additional notice or extension of the notice period.
This rule recognizes that the court has discretion to establish procedures to determine, on its own initiative,
whether relief under subdivision (p) is appropriate, but that the court is not required to establish such
procedures and may decide to act only on request of a party in interest.
Subdivision (p)(2) is added to the rule to grant creditors with a foreign address to which notices are mailed
at least 30 days' notice of the time within which to file proofs of claims if notice is mailed to the foreign
address, unless the court orders otherwise. If cause exists, such as likely delays in the delivery of notices in
particular locations, the court may extend the notice period for creditors with foreign addresses. The court may
also shorten the additional notice time if circumstances so warrant. For example, if the court in a chapter 11
case determines that supplementing the notice to a foreign creditor with notice by electronic means, such as
email or facsimile, would give the creditor reasonable notice, the court may order that the creditor be given
only 20 days' notice in accordance with Rule 2002(a)(7).
Subdivision (p)(3) is added to provide that the court may, for cause, override a creditor's designation of a
foreign address under Rule 2002(g). For example, if a party in interest believes that a creditor has wrongfully
designated a foreign address to obtain additional time when it has a significant presence in the United States,
the party can ask the court to order that notices to that creditor be sent to an address other than the one
designated by the foreign creditor.
Subdivision (q) is added to require that notice of the hearing on the petition for recognition of a foreign
proceeding be given to the debtor, all administrators in foreign proceedings of the debtor, entities against
whom provisional relief is sought, and entities with whom the debtor is engaged in litigation at the time of the
commencement of the case. There is no need at this stage of the proceedings to provide notice to all creditors.
If the foreign representative should take action to commence a case under another chapter of the Code, the
rules governing those proceedings will operate to provide that notice is given to all creditors.
[Release Point 118-106]
The rule also requires notice of the court's intention to communicate with a foreign court or foreign
representative.
Changes Made After Publication. Subdivision (g)(2) was amended to provide that the designated address of
a governmental unit under Rule 5003(e) establishes an exception to the rule that a creditor's address is to be
taken from the debtor's schedules. The fifth and sixth paragraphs of the Committee Note were amended to
explain that change.
Subdivision (p)(3) was added to the rule to provide that the court may override a creditor's designation of a
foreign mailing address under Rule 2002(g). This will permit a party in interest to seek court relief if a creditor
has improperly designated a foreign address.
Subdivision (q)(1) and (2) were amended by adopting language from §101(24) to identify foreign
representatives as "all persons or bodies authorized to administer foreign proceedings of the debtor" rather
than as "all administrators in foreign proceedings of the debtor." References to Rule 5012 in subdivision (q)(2)
and in the Committee Note were deleted.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2016 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (q) is amended to clarify the procedures for giving notice in cross-border proceedings. The
amended rule provides, in keeping with Code §1517(c), for the court to schedule a hearing to be held promptly
on the petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding. The amended rule contemplates that a hearing on a
request for provisional relief may sometimes overlap substantially with the merits of the petition for
recognition. In that case, the court may choose to consolidate the hearing on the request for provisional relief
with the hearing on the petition for recognition, see Rules 1018 and 7065, and accordingly shorten the usual
21-day notice period.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2017 AMENDMENT
Subdivisions (a) and (b) are amended and reorganized to alter the provisions governing notice under this
rule in chapter 13 cases. Subdivision (a)(9) is added to require at least 21 days' notice of the time for filing
objections to confirmation of a chapter 13 plan. Subdivision (b)(3) is added to provide separately for 28 days'
notice of the date of the confirmation hearing in a chapter 13 case. These amendments conform to amended
Rule 3015, which governs the time for presenting objections to confirmation of a chapter 13 plan. Other
changes are stylistic.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2020 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (f) is amended to add cases under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code to paragraph (7).
Subdivision (h) is amended to add cases under chapters 12 and 13 of the Bankruptcy Code and to conform
the time periods in the subdivision to the respective deadlines for filing proofs of claim under Rule 3002(c).
Subdivision (k) is amended to add a reference to subdivision (a)(9) of this rule. This change corresponds to
the relocation of the deadline for objecting to confirmation of a chapter 13 plan from subdivision (b) to
subdivision (a)(9). The rule thereby continues to require transmittal of notice of that deadline to the United
States trustee.

Rule 2003. Meeting of Creditors or Equity Security Holders
(a) DATE AND PLACE. Except as otherwise provided in §341(e) of the Code, in a chapter 7
liquidation or a chapter 11 reorganization case, the United States trustee shall call a meeting of
creditors to be held no fewer than 21 and no more than 40 days after the order for relief. In a chapter
12 family farmer debt adjustment case, the United States trustee shall call a meeting of creditors to
be held no fewer than 21 and no more than 35 days after the order for relief. In a chapter 13
individual's debt adjustment case, the United States trustee shall call a meeting of creditors to be held
no fewer than 21 and no more than 50 days after the order for relief. If there is an appeal from or a
motion to vacate the order for relief, or if there is a motion to dismiss the case, the United States
trustee may set a later date for the meeting. The meeting may be held at a regular place for holding
court or at any other place designated by the United States trustee within the district convenient for
the parties in interest. If the United States trustee designates a place for the meeting which is not
regularly staffed by the United States trustee or an assistant who may preside at the meeting, the
meeting may be held not more than 60 days after the order for relief.
(b) ORDER OF MEETING.
(1) Meeting of Creditors. The United States trustee shall preside at the meeting of creditors. The
business of the meeting shall include the examination of the debtor under oath and, in a chapter 7
liquidation case, may include the election of a creditors' committee and, if the case is not under
subchapter V of chapter 7, the election of a trustee. The presiding officer shall have the authority
to administer oaths.
(2) Meeting of Equity Security Holders. If the United States trustee convenes a meeting of
equity security holders pursuant to §341(b) of the Code, the United States trustee shall fix a date
for the meeting and shall preside.
(3) Right To Vote. In a chapter 7 liquidation case, a creditor is entitled to vote at a meeting if, at
or before the meeting, the creditor has filed a proof of claim or a writing setting forth facts
evidencing a right to vote pursuant to §702(a) of the Code unless objection is made to the claim or
the proof of claim is insufficient on its face. A creditor of a partnership may file a proof of claim
or writing evidencing a right to vote for the trustee for the estate of the general partner
notwithstanding that a trustee for the estate of the partnership has previously qualified. In the
event of an objection to the amount or allowability of a claim for the purpose of voting, unless the
court orders otherwise, the United States trustee shall tabulate the votes for each alternative
presented by the dispute and, if resolution of such dispute is necessary to determine the result of
the election, the tabulations for each alternative shall be reported to the court.
(c) RECORD OF MEETING. Any examination under oath at the meeting of creditors held
pursuant to §341(a) of the Code shall be recorded verbatim by the United States trustee using
electronic sound recording equipment or other means of recording, and such record shall be
[Release Point 118-106]
preserved by the United States trustee and available for public access until two years after the
conclusion of the meeting of creditors. Upon request of any entity, the United States trustee shall
certify and provide a copy or transcript of such recording at the entity's expense.
(d) REPORT OF ELECTION AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A CHAPTER 7 CASE.
(1) Report of Undisputed Election. In a chapter 7 case, if the election of a trustee or a member
of a creditors' committee is not disputed, the United States trustee shall promptly file a report of
the election, including the name and address of the person or entity elected and a statement that
the election is undisputed.
(2) Disputed Election. If the election is disputed, the United States trustee shall promptly file a
report stating that the election is disputed, informing the court of the nature of the dispute, and
listing the name and address of any candidate elected under any alternative presented by the
dispute. No later than the date on which the report is filed, the United States trustee shall mail a
copy of the report to any party in interest that has made a request to receive a copy of the report.
Pending disposition by the court of a disputed election for trustee, the interim trustee shall
continue in office. Unless a motion for the resolution of the dispute is filed no later than 14 days
after the United States trustee files a report of a disputed election for trustee, the interim trustee
shall serve as trustee in the case.
(e) ADJOURNMENT. The meeting may be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the
meeting of the adjourned date and time. The presiding official shall promptly file a statement
specifying the date and time to which the meeting is adjourned.
(f) SPECIAL MEETINGS. The United States trustee may call a special meeting of creditors on
request of a party in interest or on the United States trustee's own initiative.
(g) FINAL MEETING. If the United States trustee calls a final meeting of creditors in a case in
which the net proceeds realized exceed $1,500, the clerk shall mail a summary of the trustee's final
account to the creditors with a notice of the meeting, together with a statement of the amount of the
claims allowed. The trustee shall attend the final meeting and shall, if requested, report on the
administration of the estate.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Section 341(a) of the Code requires a meeting of creditors in a chapter 7, 11 or 13 case, and §341(b) permits
the court to order a meeting of equity security holders. A major change from prior law, however, prohibits the
judge from attending or presiding over the meeting. Section 341(c).
This rule does not apply either in a case for the reorganization of a railroad or for the adjustment of debts of
a municipality. Sections 1161 and 901 render §§341 and 343 inapplicable in these types of cases. Section 341
sets the requirement for a meeting of creditors and §343 provides for the examination of the debtor.
Subdivision (a). The meeting is to be held between 20 and 40 days after the date of the order for relief. In a
voluntary case, the date of the order for relief is the date of the filing of the petition (§301 of the Code); in an
involuntary case, it is the date of an actual order (§303(i) of the Code).
Subdivision (b) provides flexibility as to who will preside at the meeting of creditors. The court may
designate a person to serve as presiding officer, such as the interim trustee appointed under §701 of the Code.
If the court does not designate anyone, the clerk will preside. In either case, creditors may elect a person of
their own choosing. In any event, the clerk may remain to record the proceedings and take appearances. Use
of the clerk is not contrary to the legislative policy of §341(c). The judge remains insulated from any
information coming forth at the meeting and any information obtained by the clerk must not be relayed to the
judge.
Although the clerk may preside at the meeting, the clerk is not performing any kind of judicial role, nor
should the clerk give any semblance of performing such a role. It would be pretentious for the clerk to ascend
the bench, don a robe or be addressed as "your honor". The clerk should not appear to parties or others as any
type of judicial officer.
In a chapter 11 case, if a committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed pursuant to §1102(a)(1) of
the Code and a chairman has been selected, the chairman will preside or a person, such as the attorney for the
[Release Point 118-106]
committee, may be designated to preside by the chairman.
Since the judge must fix the bond of the trustee but cannot be present at the meeting, the rule allows the
creditors to recommend the amount of the bond. They should be able to obtain relevant information
concerning the extent of assets of the debtor at the meeting.
Paragraph (1) authorizes the presiding officer to administer oaths. This is important because the debtor's
examination must be under oath.
Paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) has application only in a chapter 7 case. That is the only type of case under
the Code that permits election of a trustee or committee. In all other cases, no vote is taken at the meeting of
creditors. If it is necessary for the court to make a determination with respect to a claim, the meeting may be
adjourned until the objection or dispute is resolved.
The second sentence recognizes that partnership creditors may vote for a trustee of a partner's estate along
with the separate creditors of the partner. Although §723(c) gives the trustee of a partnership a claim against a
partner's estate for the full amount of partnership creditors' claims allowed, the purpose and function of this
provision are to simplify distribution and prevent double proof, not to disfranchise partnership creditors in
electing a trustee of an estate against which they hold allowable claims.
Subdivision (c) requires minutes and a record of the meeting to be maintained by the presiding officer. A
verbatim record must be made of the debtor's examination but the rule is flexible as to the means used to
record the examination.
Subdivision (d) recognizes that the court must be informed immediately about the election or nonelection of
a trustee in a chapter 7 case. Pursuant to Rule 2008, the clerk officially informs the trustee of his election or
appointment and how he is to qualify. The presiding person has no authority to resolve a disputed election.
For purposes of expediency, the results of the election should be obtained for each alternative presented by
the dispute and immediately reported to the court. Thus, when an interested party presents the dispute to the
court, its prompt resolution by the court will determine the dispute and a new or adjourned meeting to conduct
the election may be avoided. The clerk is not an interested party.
A creditors' committee may be elected only in a chapter 7 case. In chapter 11 cases, a creditors' committee
is appointed pursuant to §1102.
While a final meeting is not required, Rule 2002(f)(10) provides for the trustee's final account to be sent to
creditors.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a). Many courts schedule meetings of creditors at various locations in the district. Because the
clerk must schedule meetings at those locations, an additional 20 days for scheduling the meetings is provided
under the amended rule.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The amendment to subdivision (a) relating to the calling of the meeting of creditors in a chapter 12 case is
consistent with the expedited procedures of chapter 12. Subdivision (a) is also amended to clarify that the
United States trustee does not call a meeting of creditors in a chapter 9 case. Pursuant to §901(a) of the Code,
§341 is inapplicable in chapter 9 cases. The other amendments to subdivisions (a), (b)(1), and (b)(2) and the
additions of subdivisions (f) and (g) are derived from Rule X–1006 and conform to the 1986 amendments to
§341 of the Code. The second sentence of subdivision (b)(3) is amended because Rule 2009(e) is abrogated.
Although the United States trustee fixes the date for the meeting, the clerk of the bankruptcy court transmits
the notice of the meeting unless the court orders otherwise, as prescribed in Rule 2002(a)(1).
Pursuant to §702 and §705 of the Code, creditors may elect a trustee and a committee in a chapter 7 case.
Subdivision (b) of this rule provides that the United States trustee shall preside over any election that is held
under those sections. The deletion of the last sentence of subdivision (b)(1) does not preclude creditors from
recommending to the United States trustee the amount of the trustee's bond when a trustee is elected. Trustees
and committees are not elected in chapter 11, 12, and 13 cases.
If an election is disputed, the United States trustee shall not resolve the dispute. For purposes of expediency,
the United States trustee shall tabulate the results of the election for each alternative presented by the dispute.
However, if the court finds that such tabulation is not feasible under the circumstances, the United States
trustee need not tabulate the votes. If such tabulation is feasible and if the disputed vote or votes would affect
the result of the election, the tabulations of votes for each alternative presented by the dispute shall be reported
to the court. If a motion is made for resolution of the dispute in accordance with subdivision (d) of this rule,
the court will determine the issue and another meeting to conduct the election may not be necessary.
Subdivisions (f) and (g) are derived from Rule X–1006(d) and (e), except that the amount is increased to
$1,500 to conform to the amendment to Rule 2002(f).
[Release Point 118-106]
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to extend by ten days the time for holding the meeting of creditors in a chapter
13 case. This extension will provide more flexibility for scheduling the meeting of creditors. Other
amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (d) is amended to require the United States trustee to mail a copy of a report of a disputed
election to any party in interest that has requested a copy of it. Also, if the election is for a trustee, the rule as
amended will give a party in interest ten days from the filing of the report, rather than from the date of the
meeting of creditors, to file a motion to resolve the dispute.
The substitution of "United States trustee" for "presiding officer" is stylistic. Section 341(a) of the Code
provides that the United States trustee shall preside at the meeting of creditors. Other amendments are
designed to conform to the style of Rule 2007.1(b)(3) regarding the election of a trustee in a chapter 11 case.
GAP Report on Rule 2003. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2003 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to reflect the enactment of subchapter V of chapter 7 of the Code governing
multilateral clearing organization liquidations. Section 782 of the Code provides that the designation of a
trustee or alternative trustee for the case is made by the Federal Reserve Board. Therefore, the meeting of
creditors in those cases cannot include the election of a trustee.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
If the debtor has solicited acceptances to a plan before commencement of the case, §341(e), which was
added to the Code by the 2005 amendments, authorizes the court, on request of a party in interest and after
notice and a hearing, to order that a meeting of creditors not be convened. The rule is amended to recognize
that a meeting of creditors might not be held in those cases.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2011 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) is amended to require the presiding official to file a statement after the
adjournment of a meeting of creditors or equity security holders designating the period of the adjournment.
The presiding official is the United States trustee or the United States trustee's designee. This requirement will
provide notice to parties in interest not present at the initial meeting of the date and time to which the meeting
has been continued. An adjourned meeting is "held open" as permitted by §1308(b)(1) of the Code. The filing
of this statement will also discourage premature motions to dismiss or convert the case under §1307(e).
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made to the language of the rule following publication.
The Committee Note was revised to state more explicitly that adjournment of a meeting of creditors to a
specific date constitutes holding it open for purposes of §1308(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.
Rule 2004. Examination
(a) EXAMINATION ON MOTION. On motion of any party in interest, the court may order the
examination of any entity.
(b) SCOPE OF EXAMINATION. The examination of an entity under this rule or of the debtor
under §343 of the Code may relate only to the acts, conduct, or property or to the liabilities and
financial condition of the debtor, or to any matter which may affect the administration of the debtor's
[Release Point 118-106]
estate, or to the debtor's right to a discharge. In a family farmer's debt adjustment case under chapter
12, an individual's debt adjustment case under chapter 13, or a reorganization case under chapter 11
of the Code, other than for the reorganization of a railroad, the examination may also relate to the
operation of any business and the desirability of its continuance, the source of any money or property
acquired or to be acquired by the debtor for purposes of consummating a plan and the consideration
given or offered therefor, and any other matter relevant to the case or to the formulation of a plan.
(c) COMPELLING ATTENDANCE AND PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS OR
ELECTRONICALLY STORED INFORMATION. The attendance of an entity for examination and
for the production of documents or electronically stored information, whether the examination is to
be conducted within or without the district in which the case is pending, may be compelled as
provided in Rule 9016 for the attendance of a witness at a hearing or trial. As an officer of the court,
an attorney may issue and sign a subpoena on behalf of the court where the case is pending if the
attorney is admitted to practice in that court.
(d) TIME AND PLACE OF EXAMINATION OF DEBTOR. The court may for cause shown and
on terms as it may impose order the debtor to be examined under this rule at any time or place it
designates, whether within or without the district wherein the case is pending.
(e) MILEAGE. An entity other than a debtor shall not be required to attend as a witness unless
lawful mileage and witness fee for one day's attendance shall be first tendered. If the debtor resides
more than 100 miles from the place of examination when required to appear for an examination
under this rule, the mileage allowed by law to a witness shall be tendered for any distance more than
100 miles from the debtor's residence at the date of the filing of the first petition commencing a case
under the Code or the residence at the time the debtor is required to appear for the examination,
whichever is the lesser.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 29, 2002, eff.
Dec. 1, 2002; Apr. 27, 2020, eff. Dec. 1, 2020.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a) of this rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 205(a). See generally 2 Collier,
Bankruptcy 343.02, 343.08, 343.13 (15th ed. 1981). It specifies the manner of moving for an examination.
The motion may be heard ex parte or it may be heard on notice.
Subdivision (b) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rules 205(d) and 11–26.
Subdivision (c) specifies the mode of compelling attendance of a witness or party for an examination and
for the production of evidence under this rule. The subdivision is substantially declaratory of the practice that
had developed under §21a of the Act. See 2 Collier, supra 343.11.
This subdivision will be applicable for the most part to the examination of a person other than the debtor.
The debtor is required to appear at the meeting of creditors for examination. The word "person" includes the
debtor and this subdivision may be used if necessary to obtain the debtor's attendance for examination.
Subdivision (d) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 205(f) and is not a limitation on subdivision (c).
Any person, including the debtor, served with a subpoena within the range of a subpoena must attend for
examination pursuant to subdivision (c). Subdivision (d) applies only to the debtor and a subpoena need not be
issued. There are no territorial limits on the service of an order on the debtor. See, e.g., In re Totem Lodge &
Country Club, Inc., 134 F. Supp. 158 (S.D.N.Y. 1955).
Subdivision (e) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 205(g). The lawful mileage and fee for attendance
at a United States court as a witness are prescribed by 28 U.S.C. §1821.
Definition of debtor. The word "debtor" as used in this rule includes the persons specified in the definition
in Rule 9001(5).
Spousal privilege. The limitation on the spousal privilege formerly contained in §21a of the Act is not
carried over in the Code. For privileges generally, see Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence made
applicable in cases under the Code by Rule 1101 thereof.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to allow the examination in a chapter 12 case to cover the same matters that may be
covered in an examination in a chapter 11 or 13 case.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2002 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c) is amended to clarify that an examination ordered under Rule 2004(a) may be held outside
[Release Point 118-106]
the district in which the case is pending if the subpoena is issued by the court for the district in which the
examination is to be held and is served in the manner provided in Rule 45 F. R. Civ. P., made applicable by
Rule 9016.
The subdivision is amended further to clarify that, in addition to the procedures for the issuance of a
subpoena set forth in Rule 45 F. R. Civ. P., an attorney may issue and sign a subpoena on behalf of the court
for the district in which a Rule 2004 examination is to be held if the attorney is authorized to practice, even if
admitted pro hac vice, either in the court in which the case is pending or in the court for the district in which
the examination is to be held. This provision supplements the procedures for the issuance of a subpoena set
forth in Rule 45(a)(3)(A) and (B) F. R. Civ. P. and is consistent with one of the purposes of the 1991
amendments to Rule 45, to ease the burdens of interdistrict law practice.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The typographical error was corrected, but no other
changes were made.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2020 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c) is amended in two respects. First, the provision now refers expressly to the production of
electronically stored information, in addition to the production of documents. This change is an
acknowledgment of the form in which information now commonly exists and the type of production that is
frequently sought in connection with an examination under Rule 2004.
Second, subdivision (c) is amended to bring its subpoena provision into conformity with the current version
of F.R.Civ.P. 45, which Rule 9016 makes applicable in bankruptcy cases. Under Rule 45, a subpoena always
issues from the court where the action is pending, even for a deposition in another district, and an attorney
admitted to practice in the issuing court may issue and sign it. In light of this procedure, a subpoena for a Rule
2004 examination is now properly issued from the court where the bankruptcy case is pending and by an
attorney authorized to practice in that court, even if the examination is to occur in another district.
Rule 2005. Apprehension and Removal of Debtor to Compel Attendance for
Examination
(a) ORDER TO COMPEL ATTENDANCE FOR EXAMINATION. On motion of any party in
interest supported by an affidavit alleging (1) that the examination of the debtor is necessary for the
proper administration of the estate and that there is reasonable cause to believe that the debtor is
about to leave or has left the debtor's residence or principal place of business to avoid examination,
or (2) that the debtor has evaded service of a subpoena or of an order to attend for examination, or
(3) that the debtor has willfully disobeyed a subpoena or order to attend for examination, duly
served, the court may issue to the marshal, or some other officer authorized by law, an order
directing the officer to bring the debtor before the court without unnecessary delay. If, after hearing,
the court finds the allegations to be true, the court shall thereupon cause the debtor to be examined
forthwith. If necessary, the court shall fix conditions for further examination and for the debtor's
obedience to all orders made in reference thereto.
(b) REMOVAL. Whenever any order to bring the debtor before the court is issued under this rule
and the debtor is found in a district other than that of the court issuing the order, the debtor may be
taken into custody under the order and removed in accordance with the following rules:
(1) If the debtor is taken into custody under the order at a place less than 100 miles from the
place of issue of the order, the debtor shall be brought forthwith before the court that issued the
order.
(2) If the debtor is taken into custody under the order at a place 100 miles or more from the
place of issue of the order, the debtor shall be brought without unnecessary delay before the
nearest available United States magistrate judge, bankruptcy judge, or district judge. If, after
hearing, the magistrate judge, bankruptcy judge, or district judge finds that an order has issued
under this rule and that the person in custody is the debtor, or if the person in custody waives a
hearing, the magistrate judge, bankruptcy judge, or district judge shall order removal, and the
person in custody shall be released on conditions ensuring prompt appearance before the court that
issued the order to compel the attendance.
(c) CONDITIONS OF RELEASE. In determining what conditions will reasonably assure
[Release Point 118-106]
attendance or obedience under subdivision (a) of this rule or appearance under subdivision (b) of this
rule, the court shall be governed by the relevant provisions and policies of title 18 U.S.C. §3142.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Aug. 1, 1993; Apr. 14, 2021, eff.
Dec. 1, 2021.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 206. The rule requires the debtor to be examined as soon
as possible if allegations of the movant for compulsory examination under this rule are found to be true after a
hearing. Subdivision (b) includes in paragraphs (1) and (2) provisions adapted from subdivisions (a) and (b) of
Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which governs the handling of a person arrested in one
district on a warrant issued in another. Subdivision (c) incorporates by reference the features of subdivisions
(a) and (b) of 18 U.S.C. §3146, which prescribe standards, procedures and factors to be considered in
determining conditions of release of accused persons in noncapital cases prior to trial. The word "debtor" as
used in this rule includes the persons named in Rule 9001(5).
The affidavit required to be submitted in support of the motion may be subscribed by the unsworn
declaration provided for in 28 U.S.C. §1746.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b)(2) is amended to conform to §321 of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, Pub. L. No.
101–650, which changed the title of "United States magistrate" to "United States magistrate judge." Other
amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2021 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to replace the reference to 18 U.S.C. §3146(a) and (b) with a reference to 18 U.S.C.
§3142. Sections 3141 through 3151 of Title 18 were repealed by the Bail Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. No.
98–473, Title II, §203(a), 98 Stat. 1976 (1984), and replaced by new provisions dealing with bail. The current
version of 18 U.S.C. §3146 deals not with conditions to assure attendance or appearance, but with penalties
for failure to appear. The topic of conditions is in 18 U.S.C. §3142. Because 18 U.S.C. §3142 contains
provisions bearing on topics not included in former 18 U.S.C. §3146(a) and (b), the rule is also amended to
limit the reference to the "relevant" provisions and policies of §3142.
Rule 2006. Solicitation and Voting of Proxies in Chapter 7 Liquidation Cases
(a) APPLICABILITY. This rule applies only in a liquidation case pending under chapter 7 of the
Code.
(b) DEFINITIONS.
(1) Proxy. A proxy is a written power of attorney authorizing any entity to vote the claim or
otherwise act as the owner's attorney in fact in connection with the administration of the estate.
(2) Solicitation of Proxy. The solicitation of a proxy is any communication, other than one from
an attorney to a regular client who owns a claim or from an attorney to the owner of a claim who
has requested the attorney to represent the owner, by which a creditor is asked, directly or
indirectly, to give a proxy after or in contemplation of the filing of a petition by or against the
debtor.
(c) AUTHORIZED SOLICITATION.
(1) A proxy may be solicited only by (A) a creditor owning an allowable unsecured claim
against the estate on the date of the filing of the petition; (B) a committee elected pursuant to §705
of the Code; (C) a committee of creditors selected by a majority in number and amount of claims
of creditors (i) whose claims are not contingent or unliquidated, (ii) who are not disqualified from
voting under §702(a) of the Code and (iii) who were present or represented at a meeting of which
all creditors having claims of over $500 or the 100 creditors having the largest claims had at least
seven days' notice in writing and of which meeting written minutes were kept and are available
reporting the names of the creditors present or represented and voting and the amounts of their
[Release Point 118-106]
claims; or (D) a bona fide trade or credit association, but such association may solicit only
creditors who were its members or subscribers in good standing and had allowable unsecured
claims on the date of the filing of the petition.
(2) A proxy may be solicited only in writing.
(d) SOLICITATION NOT AUTHORIZED. This rule does not permit solicitation (1) in any
interest other than that of general creditors; (2) by or on behalf of any custodian; (3) by the interim
trustee or by or on behalf of any entity not qualified to vote under §702(a) of the Code; (4) by or on
behalf of an attorney at law; or (5) by or on behalf of a transferee of a claim for collection only.
(e) DATA REQUIRED FROM HOLDERS OF MULTIPLE PROXIES. At any time before the
voting commences at any meeting of creditors pursuant to §341(a) of the Code, or at any other time
as the court may direct, a holder of two or more proxies shall file and transmit to the United States
trustee a verified list of the proxies to be voted and a verified statement of the pertinent facts and
circumstances in connection with the execution and delivery of each proxy, including:
(1) a copy of the solicitation;
(2) identification of the solicitor, the forwarder, if the forwarder is neither the solicitor nor the
owner of the claim, and the proxyholder, including their connections with the debtor and with each
other. If the solicitor, forwarder, or proxyholder is an association, there shall also be included a
statement that the creditors whose claims have been solicited and the creditors whose claims are to
be voted were members or subscribers in good standing and had allowable unsecured claims on
the date of the filing of the petition. If the solicitor, forwarder, or proxyholder is a committee of
creditors, the statement shall also set forth the date and place the committee was organized, that
the committee was organized in accordance with clause (B) or (C) of paragraph (c)(1) of this rule,
the members of the committee, the amounts of their claims, when the claims were acquired, the
amounts paid therefor, and the extent to which the claims of the committee members are secured
or entitled to priority;
(3) a statement that no consideration has been paid or promised by the proxyholder for the
proxy;
(4) a statement as to whether there is any agreement and, if so, the particulars thereof, between
the proxyholder and any other entity for the payment of any consideration in connection with
voting the proxy, or for the sharing of compensation with any entity, other than a member or
regular associate of the proxyholder's law firm, which may be allowed the trustee or any entity for
services rendered in the case, or for the employment of any person as attorney, accountant,
appraiser, auctioneer, or other employee for the estate;
(5) if the proxy was solicited by an entity other than the proxyholder, or forwarded to the holder
by an entity who is neither a solicitor of the proxy nor the owner of the claim, a statement signed
and verified by the solicitor or forwarder that no consideration has been paid or promised for the
proxy, and whether there is any agreement, and, if so, the particulars thereof, between the solicitor
or forwarder and any other entity for the payment of any consideration in connection with voting
the proxy, or for sharing compensation with any entity other than a member or regular associate of
the solicitor's or forwarder's law firm which may be allowed the trustee or any entity for services
rendered in the case, or for the employment of any person as attorney, accountant, appraiser,
auctioneer, or other employee for the estate;
(6) if the solicitor, forwarder, or proxyholder is a committee, a statement signed and verified by
each member as to the amount and source of any consideration paid or to be paid to such member
in connection with the case other than by way of dividend on the member's claim.
(f) ENFORCEMENT OF RESTRICTIONS ON SOLICITATION. On motion of any party in
interest or on its own initiative, the court may determine whether there has been a failure to comply
with the provisions of this rule or any other impropriety in connection with the solicitation or voting
of a proxy. After notice and a hearing the court may reject any proxy for cause, vacate any order
entered in consequence of the voting of any proxy which should have been rejected, or take any
other appropriate action.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is a comprehensive regulation of solicitation and voting of proxies in liquidation cases. It is
derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 208. The rule applies only in chapter 7 cases because no voting occurs,
other than on a plan, in a chapter 11 case. Former Bankruptcy Rule 208 did not apply to solicitations of
acceptances of plans.
Creditor control was a basic feature of the Act and is continued, in part, by the Code. Creditor democracy is
perverted and the congressional objective frustrated, however, if control of administration falls into the hands
of persons whose principal interest is not in what the estate can be made to yield to the unsecured creditors but
in what it can yield to those involved in its administration or in other ulterior objectives.
Subdivision (b). The definition of proxy in the first paragraph of subdivision (b) is derived from former
Bankruptcy Rule 208.
Subdivision (c). The purpose of the rule is to protect creditors against loss of control of administration of
their debtors' estates to holders of proxies having interests that differ from those of the creditors. The rule does
not prohibit solicitation but restricts it to those who were creditors at the commencement of the case or their
freely and fairly selected representatives. The special role occupied by credit and trade associations is
recognized in the last clause of subdivision (c)(1). On the assumption that members or subscribers may have
affiliated with an association in part for the purpose of obtaining its services as a representative in liquidation
proceedings, an established association is authorized to solicit its own members, or its regular customers or
clients, who were creditors on the date of the filing of the petition. Although the association may not solicit
nonmembers or nonsubscribers for proxies, it may sponsor a meeting of creditors at which a committee
entitled to solicit proxies may be selected in accordance with clause (C) of subdivision (c)(1).
Under certain circumstances, the relationship of a creditor, creditors' committee, or association to the estate
or the case may be such as to warrant rejection of any proxy solicited by such a person or group. Thus a
person who is forbidden by the Code to vote his own claim should be equally disabled to solicit proxies from
creditors. Solicitation by or on behalf of the debtor has been uniformly condemned, e.g., In re White, 15 F.2d
371 (9th Cir. 1926), as has solicitation on behalf of a preferred creditor, Matter of Law, 13 Am.B.R. 650 (S.D.
Ill. 1905). The prohibition on solicitation by a receiver or his attorney made explicit by General Order 39 has
been collaterally supported by rulings rejecting proxies solicited by a receiver in equity, In re Western States
Bldg.-Loan Ass'n, 54 F.2d 415 (S.D. Cal. 1931), and by an assignee for the benefit of creditors, Lines v.
Falstaff Brewing Co., 233 F.2d 927 (9th Cir. 1956).
Subdivision (d) prohibits solicitation by any person or group having a relationship described in the
preceding paragraph. It also makes no exception for attorneys or transferees of claims for collection. The rule
does not undertake to regulate communications between an attorney and his regular client or between an
attorney and a creditor who has asked the attorney to represent him in a proceeding under the Code, but any
other communication by an attorney or any other person or group requesting a proxy from the owner of a
claim constitutes a regulated solicitation. Solicitation by an attorney of a proxy from a creditor who was not a
client prior to the solicitation is objectionable not only as unethical conduct as recognized by such cases as In
the Matter of Darland Company, 184 F. Supp. 760 (S.D. Iowa 1960) but also and more importantly because
the practice carries a substantial risk that administration will fall into the hands of those whose interest is in
obtaining fees from the estate rather than securing dividends for creditors. The same risk attaches to
solicitation by the holder of a claim for collection only.
Subdivision (e). The regulation of solicitation and voting of proxies is achieved by the rule principally
through the imposition of requirements of disclosure on the holders of two or more proxies. The disclosures
must be made to the clerk before the meeting at which the proxies are to be voted to afford the clerk or a party
in interest an opportunity to examine the circumstances accompanying the acquisition of the proxies in
advance of any exercise of the proxies. In the light of the examination the clerk or a party in interest should
bring to the attention of the judge any question that arises and the judge may permit the proxies that comply
with the rule to be voted and reject those that do not unless the holders can effect or establish compliance in
such manner as the court shall prescribe. The holders of single proxies are excused from the disclosure
requirements because of the insubstantiality of the risk that such proxies have been solicited, or will be voted,
in an interest other than that of general creditors.
Every holder of two or more proxies must include in the submission a verified statement that no
consideration has been paid or promised for the proxy, either by the proxyholder or the solicitor or any
forwarder of the proxy. Any payment or promise of consideration for a proxy would be conclusive evidence of
a purpose to acquire control of the administration of an estate for an ulterior purpose. The holder of multiple
[Release Point 118-106]
proxies must also include in the submission a verified statement as to whether there is any agreement by the
holder, the solicitor, or any forwarder of the proxy for the employment of any person in the administration of
an estate or for the sharing of any compensation allowed in connection with the administration of the estate.
The provisions requiring these statements implement the policy of the Code expressed in §504 as well as the
policy of this rule to deter the acquisition of proxies for the purpose of obtaining a share in the outlays for
administration. Finally the facts as to any consideration moving or promised to any member of a committee
which functions as a solicitor, forwarder, or proxyholder must be disclosed by the proxyholder. Such
information would be of significance to the court in evaluating the purpose of the committee in obtaining,
transmitting, or voting proxies.
Subdivision (f) has counterparts in the local rules referred to in the Advisory Committee's Note to former
Bankruptcy Rule 208. Courts have been accorded a wide range of discretion in the handling of disputes
involving proxies. Thus the referee was allowed to reject proxies and to proceed forthwith to hold a scheduled
election at the same meeting. E.g., In re Portage Wholesale Co., 183 F.2d 959 (7th Cir. 1950); In re McGill,
106 Fed. 57 (6th Cir. 1901); In re Deena Woolen Mills, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 260, 273 (D. Me. 1953); In re
Finlay, 3 Am.B.R. 738 (S.D.N.Y. 1900). The bankruptcy judge may postpone an election to permit a
determination of issues presented by a dispute as to proxies and to afford those creditors whose proxies are
rejected an opportunity to give new proxies or to attend an adjourned meeting to vote their own claims. Cf. In
the Matter of Lenrick Sales, Inc., 369 F.2d 439, 442–43 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 822 (1967); In the
Matter of Construction Supply Corp. 221 F. Supp. 124, 128 (E.D. Va. 1963). This rule is not intended to
restrict the scope of the court's discretion in the handling of disputes as to proxies.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to give the United States trustee information in connection with proxies so that the
United States trustee may perform responsibilities as presiding officer at the §341 meeting of creditors. See
Rule 2003.
The words "with the clerk" are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
Rule 2007. Review of Appointment of Creditors' Committee Organized Before
Commencement of the Case
(a) MOTION TO REVIEW APPOINTMENT. If a committee appointed by the United States
trustee pursuant to §1102(a) of the Code consists of the members of a committee organized by
creditors before the commencement of a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case, on motion of a party in interest
and after a hearing on notice to the United States trustee and other entities as the court may direct,
the court may determine whether the appointment of the committee satisfies the requirements of
§1102(b)(1) of the Code.
(b) SELECTION OF MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE. The court may find that a committee
organized by unsecured creditors before the commencement of a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case was
fairly chosen if:
(1) it was selected by a majority in number and amount of claims of unsecured creditors who
may vote under §702(a) of the Code and were present in person or represented at a meeting of
which all creditors having unsecured claims of over $1,000 or the 100 unsecured creditors having
the largest claims had at least seven days' notice in writing, and of which meeting written minutes
reporting the names of the creditors present or represented and voting and the amounts of their
claims were kept and are available for inspection;
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) all proxies voted at the meeting for the elected committee were solicited pursuant to Rule
2006 and the lists and statements required by subdivision (e) thereof have been transmitted to the
United States trustee; and
(3) the organization of the committee was in all other respects fair and proper.
(c) FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR APPOINTMENT. After a hearing
on notice pursuant to subdivision (a) of this rule, the court shall direct the United States trustee to
vacate the appointment of the committee and may order other appropriate action if the court finds
that such appointment failed to satisfy the requirements of §1102(b)(1) of the Code.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Mar. 26, 2009, eff.
Dec. 1, 2009.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Section 1102(b)(1) of the Code permits the court to appoint as the unsecured creditors' committee, the
committee that was selected by creditors before the order for relief. This provision recognizes the propriety of
continuing a "prepetition" committee in an official capacity. Such a committee, however, must be found to
have been fairly chosen and representative of the different kinds of claims to be represented.
Subdivision (a) does not necessarily require a hearing but does require a party in interest to bring to the
court's attention the fact that a prepetition committee had been organized and should be appointed. An
application would suffice for this purpose. Party in interest would include the committee, any member of the
committee, or any of its agents acting for the committee. Whether or not notice of the application should be
given to any other party is left to the discretion of the court.
Subdivision (b) implements §1102(b)(1). The Code provision allows the court to appoint, as the official
§1102(a) committee, a "prepetition" committee if its members were fairly chosen and the committee is
representative of the different kinds of claims. This subdivision of the rule indicates some of the factors the
court may consider in determining whether the requirements of §1102(b)(1) have been satisfied. In effect, the
subdivision provides various factors which are similar to those set forth in Rule 2006 with respect to the
solicitation and voting of proxies in a chapter 7 liquidation case.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to conform to the 1984 amendments to §1102(b)(1) of the Code.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to conform to the 1986 amendments to §1102(a). The United States trustee appoints
committees pursuant to §1102 in chapter 11 cases. Section 1102 is applicable in chapter 9 cases pursuant to
§901(a).
Although §1102(b)(1) of the Code permits the United States trustee to appoint a prepetition committee as
the statutory committee if its members were fairly chosen and it is representative of the different kinds of
claims to be represented, the amendment to this rule provides a procedure for judicial review of the
appointment. The factors that may be considered by the court in determining whether the committee was fairly
chosen are not new. A finding that a prepetition committee has not been fairly chosen does not prohibit the
appointment of some or all of its members to the creditors' committee. Although this rule deals only with
judicial review of the appointment of prepetition committees, it does not preclude judicial review under Rule
2020 regarding the appointment of other committees.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
[Release Point 118-106]
Rule 2007.1. Appointment of Trustee or Examiner in a Chapter 11
Reorganization Case
(a) ORDER TO APPOINT TRUSTEE OR EXAMINER. In a chapter 11 reorganization case, a
motion for an order to appoint a trustee or an examiner under §1104(a) or §1104(c) of the Code shall
be made in accordance with Rule 9014.
(b) ELECTION OF TRUSTEE.
(1) Request for an Election. A request to convene a meeting of creditors for the purpose of
electing a trustee in a chapter 11 reorganization case shall be filed and transmitted to the United
States trustee in accordance with Rule 5005 within the time prescribed by §1104(b) of the Code.
Pending court approval of the person elected, any person appointed by the United States trustee
under §1104(d) and approved in accordance with subdivision (c) of this rule shall serve as trustee.
(2) Manner of Election and Notice. An election of a trustee under §1104(b) of the Code shall be
conducted in the manner provided in Rules 2003(b)(3) and 2006. Notice of the meeting of
creditors convened under §1104(b) shall be given as provided in Rule 2002. The United States
trustee shall preside at the meeting. A proxy for the purpose of voting in the election may be
solicited only by a committee of creditors appointed under §1102 of the Code or by any other
party entitled to solicit a proxy pursuant to Rule 2006.
(3) Report of Election and Resolution of Disputes.
(A) Report of Undisputed Election. If no dispute arises out of the election, the United States
trustee shall promptly file a report certifying the election, including the name and address of the
person elected and a statement that the election is undisputed. The report shall be accompanied
by a verified statement of the person elected setting forth that person's connections with the
debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the
United States trustee, or any person employed in the office of the United States trustee.
(B) Dispute Arising Out of an Election. If a dispute arises out of an election, the United States
trustee shall promptly file a report stating that the election is disputed, informing the court of the
nature of the dispute, and listing the name and address of any candidate elected under any
alternative presented by the dispute. The report shall be accompanied by a verified statement by
each candidate elected under each alternative presented by the dispute, setting forth the person's
connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and
accountants, the United States trustee, or any person employed in the office of the United States
trustee. Not later than the date on which the report of the disputed election is filed, the United
States trustee shall mail a copy of the report and each verified statement to any party in interest
that has made a request to convene a meeting under §1104(b) or to receive a copy of the report,
and to any committee appointed under §1102 of the Code.
(c) APPROVAL OF APPOINTMENT. An order approving the appointment of a trustee or an
examiner under §1104(d) of the Code shall be made on application of the United States trustee. The
application shall state the name of the person appointed and, to the best of the applicant's knowledge,
all the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other parties in interest, their respective
attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, or persons employed in the office of the United
States trustee. The application shall state the names of the parties in interest with whom the United
States trustee consulted regarding the appointment. The application shall be accompanied by a
verified statement of the person appointed setting forth the person's connections with the debtor,
creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States
trustee, or any person employed in the office of the United States trustee.
(Added Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; amended Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997; Apr. 23, 2008,
eff. Dec. 1, 2008.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991
This rule is added to implement the 1986 amendments to §1104 of the Code regarding the appointment of a
trustee or examiner in a chapter 11 case. A motion for an order to appoint a trustee or examiner is a contested
matter. Although the court decides whether the appointment is warranted under the particular facts of the case,
[Release Point 118-106]
it is the United States trustee who makes the appointment pursuant to §1104(c) of the Code. The appointment
is subject to approval of the court, however, which may be obtained by application of the United States
trustee. Section 1104(c) of the Code requires that the appointment be made after consultation with parties in
interest and that the person appointed be disinterested.
The requirement that connections with the United States trustee or persons employed in the United States
trustee's office be revealed is not intended to enlarge the definition of "disinterested person" in §101(13) of the
Code, to supersede executive regulations or other laws relating to appointments by United States trustees, or to
otherwise restrict the United States trustee's discretion in making appointments. This information is required,
however, in the interest of full disclosure and confidence in the appointment process and to give the court all
information that may be relevant to the exercise of judicial discretion in approving the appointment of a
trustee or examiner in a chapter 11 case.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1997 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to implement the 1994 amendments to §1104 of the Code regarding the election of a
trustee in a chapter 11 case.
Eligibility for voting in an election for a chapter 11 trustee is determined in accordance with Rule
2003(b)(3). Creditors whose claims are deemed filed under §1111(a) are treated for voting purposes as
creditors who have filed proofs of claim.
Proxies for the purpose of voting in the election may be solicited only by a creditors' committee appointed
under §1102 or by any other party entitled to solicit proxies pursuant to Rule 2006. Therefore, a trustee or
examiner who has served in the case, or a committee of equity security holders appointed under §1102, may
not solicit proxies.
The procedures for reporting disputes to the court derive from similar provisions in Rule 2003(d) applicable
to chapter 7 cases. An election may be disputed by a party in interest or by the United States trustee. For
example, if the United States trustee believes that the person elected is ineligible to serve as trustee because
the person is not "disinterested," the United States trustee should file a report disputing the election.
The word "only" is deleted from subdivision (b), redesignated as subdivision (c), to avoid any negative
inference with respect to the availability of procedures for obtaining review of the United States trustee's acts
or failure to act pursuant to Rule 2020.
GAP Report on Rule 2017.1. The published draft of proposed new subdivision (b)(3) of Rule 2017.1
[2007.1], and the Committee Note, was substantially revised to implement Mr. Patchan's recommendations
(described above), to clarify how a disputed election will be reported, and to make stylistic improvements.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Under §1104(b)(2) of the Code, as amended in 2005, if an eligible, disinterested person is elected to serve
as trustee in a chapter 11 case, the United States trustee is directed to file a report certifying the election. The
person elected does not have to be appointed to the position. Rather, the filing of the report certifying the
election itself constitutes the appointment. The section further provides that in the event of a dispute in the
election of a trustee, the court must resolve the matter. The rule is amended to be consistent with §1104(b)(2).
When the United States trustee files a report certifying the election of a trustee, the person elected must
provide a verified statement, similar to the statement required of professional persons under Rule 2014,
disclosing connections with parties in interest and certain other persons connected with the case. Although
court approval of the person elected is not required, the disclosure of the person's connections will enable
parties in interest to determine whether the person is disinterested.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
Rule 2007.2. Appointment of Patient Care Ombudsman in a Health Care
Business Case
(a) ORDER TO APPOINT PATIENT CARE OMBUDSMAN. In a chapter 7, chapter 9, or
chapter 11 case in which the debtor is a health care business, the court shall order the appointment of
a patient care ombudsman under §333 of the Code, unless the court, on motion of the United States
trustee or a party in interest filed no later than 21 days after the commencement of the case or within
another time fixed by the court, finds that the appointment of a patient care ombudsman is not
necessary under the specific circumstances of the case for the protection of patients.
(b) MOTION FOR ORDER TO APPOINT OMBUDSMAN. If the court has found that the
appointment of an ombudsman is not necessary, or has terminated the appointment, the court, on
[Release Point 118-106]
motion of the United States trustee or a party in interest, may order the appointment at a later time if
it finds that the appointment has become necessary to protect patients.
(c) NOTICE OF APPOINTMENT. If a patient care ombudsman is appointed under §333, the
United States trustee shall promptly file a notice of the appointment, including the name and address
of the person appointed. Unless the person appointed is a State Long-Term Care Ombudsman, the
notice shall be accompanied by a verified statement of the person appointed setting forth the person's
connections with the debtor, creditors, patients, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys
and accountants, the United States trustee, and any person employed in the office of the United
States trustee.
(d) TERMINATION OF APPOINTMENT. On motion of the United States trustee or a party in
interest, the court may terminate the appointment of a patient care ombudsman if the court finds that
the appointment is not necessary to protect patients.
(e) MOTION. A motion under this rule shall be governed by Rule 9014. The motion shall be
transmitted to the United States trustee and served on: the debtor; the trustee; any committee elected
under §705 or appointed under §1102 of the Code or its authorized agent, or, if the case is a chapter
9 municipality case or a chapter 11 reorganization case and no committee of unsecured creditors has
been appointed under §1102, on the creditors included on the list filed under Rule 1007(d); and such
other entities as the court may direct.
(Added Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; amended Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008
Section 333 of the Code, added by the 2005 amendments, requires the court to order the appointment of a
health care ombudsman within the first 30 days of a health care business case, unless the court finds that the
appointment is not necessary for the protection of patients. The rule recognizes this requirement and provides
a procedure by which a party may obtain a court order finding that the appointment of a patient care
ombudsman is unnecessary. In the absence of a timely motion under subdivision (a) of this rule, the court will
enter an order directing the United States trustee to appoint the ombudsman.
Subdivision (b) recognizes that, despite a previous order finding that a patient care ombudsman is not
necessary, circumstances of the case may change or newly discovered evidence may demonstrate the necessity
of an ombudsman to protect the interests of patients. In that event, a party may move the court for an order
directing the appointment of an ombudsman.
When the appointment of a patient care ombudsman is ordered, the United States trustee is required to
appoint a disinterested person to serve in that capacity. Court approval of the appointment is not required, but
subdivision (c) requires the person appointed, if not a State Long-Term Care Ombudsman, to file a verified
statement similar to the statement filed by professional persons under Rule 2014 so that parties in interest will
have information relevant to disinterestedness. If a party believes that the person appointed is not
disinterested, it may file a motion asking the court to find that the person is not eligible to serve.
Subdivision (d) permits parties in interest to move for the termination of the appointment of a patient care
ombudsman. If the movant can show that there no longer is any need for the ombudsman, the court may order
the termination of the appointment.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
Rule 2008. Notice to Trustee of Selection
The United States trustee shall immediately notify the person selected as trustee how to qualify
[Release Point 118-106]
and, if applicable, the amount of the trustee's bond. A trustee that has filed a blanket bond pursuant to
Rule 2010 and has been selected as trustee in a chapter 7, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case that does not
notify the court and the United States trustee in writing of rejection of the office within seven days
after receipt of notice of selection shall be deemed to have accepted the office. Any other person
selected as trustee shall notify the court and the United States trustee in writing of acceptance of the
office within seven days after receipt of notice of selection or shall be deemed to have rejected the
office.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Mar. 26, 2009, eff.
Dec. 1, 2009.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 209(c). The remainder of that rule is inapplicable
because its provisions are covered by §§701–703, 321 of the Code.
If the person selected as trustee accepts the office, he must qualify within five days after his selection, as
required by §322(a) of the Code.
In districts having a standing trustee for chapter 13 cases, a blanket acceptance of the appointment would be
sufficient for compliance by the standing trustee with this rule.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to eliminate the need for a standing chapter 13 trustee or member of the panel of
chapter 7 trustees to accept or reject an appointment.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The amendments to this rule relating to the United States trustee are derived from Rule X–1004(a) and
conform to the 1986 amendments to the Code and 28 U.S.C. §586 which provide that the United States trustee
appoints and supervises trustees, and in a chapter 7 case presides over any election of a trustee. This rule
applies when a trustee is either appointed or elected. This rule is also amended to provide for chapter 12 cases.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
Rule 2009. Trustees for Estates When Joint Administration Ordered
(a) ELECTION OF SINGLE TRUSTEE FOR ESTATES BEING JOINTLY ADMINISTERED. If
the court orders a joint administration of two or more estates under Rule 1015(b), creditors may elect
a single trustee for the estates being jointly administered, unless the case is under subchapter V of
chapter 7 or subchapter V of chapter 11 of the Code.
(b) RIGHT OF CREDITORS TO ELECT SEPARATE TRUSTEE. Notwithstanding entry of an
order for joint administration under Rule 1015(b), the creditors of any debtor may elect a separate
trustee for the estate of the debtor as provided in §702 of the Code, unless the case is under
subchapter V of chapter 7 or subchapter V of chapter 11 of the Code.
(c) APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEES FOR ESTATES BEING JOINTLY ADMINISTERED.
(1) Chapter 7 Liquidation Cases. Except in a case governed by subchapter V of chapter 7, the
United States trustee may appoint one or more interim trustees for estates being jointly
administered in chapter 7 cases.
(2) Chapter 11 Reorganization Cases. If the appointment of a trustee is ordered or is required
by the Code, the United States trustee may appoint one or more trustees for estates being jointly
administered in chapter 11 cases.
[Release Point 118-106]
(3) Chapter 12 Family Farmer's Debt Adjustment Cases. The United States trustee may appoint
one or more trustees for estates being jointly administered in chapter 12 cases.
(4) Chapter 13 Individual's Debt Adjustment Cases. The United States trustee may appoint one
or more trustees for estates being jointly administered in chapter 13 cases.
(d) POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. On a showing that creditors or equity security
holders of the different estates will be prejudiced by conflicts of interest of a common trustee who
has been elected or appointed, the court shall order the selection of separate trustees for estates being
jointly administered.
(e) SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. The trustee or trustees of estates being jointly administered shall
keep separate accounts of the property and distribution of each estate.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Mar. 27, 2003, eff.
Dec. 1, 2003; Apr. 11, 2022, eff. Dec. 1, 2022.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is applicable in chapter 7 cases and, in part, in chapter 11 and 13 cases. The provisions in
subdivisions (a) and (b) concerning creditor election of a trustee apply only in a chapter 7 case because it is
only pursuant to §702 of the Code that creditors may elect a trustee. Subdivision (c) of the rule applies in
chapter 11 and 13 as well as chapter 7 cases; pursuant to §1104 of the Code, the court may order the
appointment of a trustee on application of a party in interest and, pursuant to §1163 of the Code, the court
must appoint a trustee in a railroad reorganization case. Subdivision (c) should not be taken as an indication
that more than one trustee may be appointed for a single debtor. Section 1104(c) permits only one trustee for
each estate. In a chapter 13 case, if there is no standing trustee, the court is to appoint a person to serve as
trustee pursuant to §1302 of the Code. There is no provision for a trustee in a chapter 9 case, except for a very
limited purpose; see §926 of the Code.
This rule recognizes that economical and expeditious administration of two or more estates may be
facilitated not only by the selection of a single trustee for a partnership and its partners, but by such selection
whenever estates are being jointly administered pursuant to Rule 1015. See In the Matter of International Oil
Co., 427 F.2d 186, 187 (2d Cir. 1970). The rule is derived from former §5c of the Act and former Bankruptcy
Rule 210. The premise of §5c of the Act was that notwithstanding the potentiality of conflict between the
interests of the creditors of the partners and those of the creditors of the partnership, the conflict is not
sufficiently serious or frequent in most cases to warrant the selection of separate trustees for the firm and the
several partners. Even before the proviso was added to §5c of the Act in 1938 to permit the creditors of a
general partner to elect their separate trustee for his estate, it was held that the court had discretion to permit
such an election or to make a separate appointment when a conflict of interest was recognized. In re Wood,
248 Fed. 246, 249–50 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 247 U.S. 512 (1918); 4 Collier, Bankruptcy 723.04 (15th ed.
1980). The rule retains in subdivision (e) the features of the practice respecting the selection of a trustee that
was developed under §5 of the Act. Subdivisions (a) and (c) permit the court to authorize election of a single
trustee or to make a single appointment when joint administration of estates of other kinds of debtors is
ordered, but subdivision (d) requires the court to make a preliminary evaluation of the risks of conflict of
interest. If after the election or appointment of a common trustee a conflict of interest materializes, the court
must take appropriate action to deal with it.
Subdivision (f) is derived from §5e of the Act and former Bankruptcy Rule 210(f) and requires that the
common trustee keep a separate account for each estate in all cases that are jointly administered.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
One or more trustees may be appointed for estates being jointly administered in chapter 12 cases.
The amendments to this rule are derived from Rule X–1005 and are necessary because the United States
trustee, rather than the court, has responsibility for appointing trustees pursuant to §§701, 1104, 1202, and
1302 of the Code.
If separate trustees are ordered for chapter 7 estates pursuant to subdivision (d), separate and successor
trustees should be chosen as prescribed in §703 of the Code. If the occasion for another election arises, the
United States trustee should call a meeting of creditors for this purpose. An order to select separate trustees
does not disqualify an appointed or elected trustee from serving for one of the estates.
Subdivision (e) is abrogated because the exercise of discretion by the United States trustee, who is in the
Executive Branch, is not subject to advance restriction by rule of court. United States v. Cox, 342 F.2d 167
(5th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 863 (1965); United States v. Frumento, 409 F.Supp. 136, 141 (E.D.Pa.),
[Release Point 118-106]
aff'd, 563 F.2d 1083 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1072 (1977); see, Smith v. United States, 375 F.2d
243 (5th Cir. 1967); House Report No. 95–595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 110 (1977). However, a trustee
appointed by the United States trustee may be removed by the court for cause. See §324 of the Code.
Subdivision (d) of this rule, as amended, is consistent with §324. Subdivision (f) is redesignated as
subdivision (e).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2003 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to reflect the enactment of subchapter V of chapter 7 of the Code governing
multilateral clearing organization liquidations. Section 782 of the Code provides that the designation of a
trustee or alternative trustee for the case is made by the Federal Reserve Board. Therefore, neither the United
States trustee nor the creditors can appoint or elect a trustee in these cases.
Other amendments are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended in response to the enactment of the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, Pub.
L. No. 116–54, 133 Stat. 1079. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to be a debtor
under subchapter V of chapter 11. In a case under that subchapter, §1183 of the Code requires the United
States trustee to appoint a trustee, so there will be no election. Accordingly, subdivisions (a) and (b) of the rule
are amended to except cases under subchapter V from their coverage. Subdivision (c)(2), which addresses the
appointment of trustees in jointly administered chapter 11 cases, is amended to make it applicable to cases
under subchapter V.
Rule 2010. Qualification by Trustee; Proceeding on Bond
(a) BLANKET BOND. The United States trustee may authorize a blanket bond in favor of the
United States conditioned on the faithful performance of official duties by the trustee or trustees to
cover (1) a person who qualifies as trustee in a number of cases, and (2) a number of trustees each of
whom qualifies in a different case.
(b) PROCEEDING ON BOND. A proceeding on the trustee's bond may be brought by any party
in interest in the name of the United States for the use of the entity injured by the breach of the
condition.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivisions (a) and (b). Subdivision (a) gives authority for approval by the court of a single bond to cover
(1) a person who qualifies as trustee in a number of cases, and (2) a number of trustees each of whom qualifies
in a different case. The cases need not be related in any way. Substantial economies can be effected if a single
bond covering a number of different cases can be issued and approved at one time. When a blanket bond is
filed, the trustee qualifies under subdivision (b) of the rule by filing an acceptance of the office.
Subdivision (c) prescribes the evidentiary effect of a certified copy of an order approving the trustee's bond
given by a trustee under this rule or, when a blanket bond has been authorized, of a certified copy of
acceptance. This rule supplements the Federal Rules of Evidence, which apply in bankruptcy cases. See Rule
1101 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The order of approval should conform to Official Form No. 25. See,
however, §549(c) of the Code which provides only for the filing of the petition in the real estate records to
serve as constructive notice of the pendency of the case. See also Rule 2011 which prescribes the evidentiary
effect of a certificate that the debtor is a debtor in possession.
Subdivision (d) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 212(f). Reference should be made to §322(a) and
(d) of the Code which requires the bond to be filed with the bankruptcy court and places a two year limitation
for the commencement of a proceeding on the bond. A bond filed under this rule should conform to Official
Form No. 25. A proceeding on the bond of a trustee is governed by the rules in Part VII. See the Note
accompanying Rule 7001. See also Rule 9025.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is deleted because of the amendment to Rule 2008.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
[Release Point 118-106]
This rule is amended to conform to the 1986 amendment of §322 of the Code. The United States trustee
determines the amount and sufficiency of the trustee's bond. The amendment to subdivision (a) is derived
from Rule X–1004(b).
Subdivision (b) is abrogated because an order approving a bond is no longer necessary in view of the 1986
amendments to §322 of the Code. Subdivision (c) is redesignated as subdivision (b).
Rule 2011. Evidence of Debtor in Possession or Qualification of Trustee
(a) Whenever evidence is required that a debtor is a debtor in possession or that a trustee has
qualified, the clerk may so certify and the certificate shall constitute conclusive evidence of that fact.
(b) If a person elected or appointed as trustee does not qualify within the time prescribed by
§322(a) of the Code, the clerk shall so notify the court and the United States trustee.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule prescribes the evidentiary effect of a certificate issued by the clerk that the debtor is a debtor in
possession. See Official Form No. 26. Only chapter 11 of the Code provides for a debtor in possession. See
§1107(a) of the Code. If, however, a trustee is appointed in the chapter 11 case, there will not be a debtor in
possession. See §§1101(1), 1105 of the Code.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to provide a procedure for proving that a trustee has qualified in accordance with §322
of the Code. Subdivision (b) is added so that the court and the United States trustee will be informed if the
person selected as trustee pursuant to §§701, 702, 1104, 1202, 1302, or 1163 fails to qualify within the time
prescribed in §322(a).
Rule 2012. Substitution of Trustee or Successor Trustee; Accounting
(a) TRUSTEE. If a trustee is appointed in a chapter 11 case (other than under subchapter V), or
the debtor is removed as debtor in possession in a chapter 12 case or in a case under subchapter V of
chapter 11, the trustee is substituted automatically for the debtor in possession as a party in any
pending action, proceeding, or matter.
(b) SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE. When a trustee dies, resigns, is removed, or otherwise ceases to
hold office during the pendency of a case under the Code (1) the successor is automatically
substituted as a party in any pending action, proceeding, or matter; and (2) the successor trustee shall
prepare, file, and transmit to the United States trustee an accounting of the prior administration of the
estate.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 11, 2022, eff.
Dec. 1, 2022.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Paragraph (1) of this rule implements §325 of the Code. It provides that a pending action or proceeding
continues without abatement and that the trustee's successor is automatically substituted as a party whether it
be another trustee or the debtor returned to possession, as such party.
Paragraph (2) places it within the responsibility of a successor trustee to file an accounting of the prior
administration of the estate. If an accounting is impossible to obtain from the prior trustee because of death or
lack of cooperation, prior reports submitted in the earlier administration may be updated.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is new. The subdivision provides for the substitution of a trustee appointed in a chapter 11
case for the debtor in possession in any pending litigation.
The original provisions of the rule are now in subdivision (b).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to include any chapter 12 case in which the debtor is removed as debtor in
[Release Point 118-106]
possession pursuant to §1204(a) of the Code.
Subdivision (b) is amended to require that the accounting of the prior administration which must be filed
with the court is also transmitted to the United States trustee who is responsible for supervising the
administration of cases and trustees. See 28 U.S.C. §586(a)(3). Because a court order is not required for the
appointment of a successor trustee, requiring the court to fix a time for filing the accounting is inefficient and
unnecessary. The United States trustee has supervisory powers over trustees and may require the successor
trustee to file the accounting within a certain time period. If the successor trustee fails to file the accounting
within a reasonable time, the United States trustee or a party in interest may take appropriate steps including a
request for an appropriate court order. See 28 U.S.C. §586(a)(3)(G). The words "with the court" are deleted in
subdivision (b)(2) as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended in response to the enactment of the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, Pub.
L. No. 116–54, 133 Stat. 1079. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to be a debtor
under subchapter V of chapter 11. Subdivision (a) of the rule is amended to include any case under that
subchapter in which the debtor is removed as debtor in possession under §1185 of the Code.
Rule 2013. Public Record of Compensation Awarded to Trustees, Examiners,
and Professionals
(a) RECORD TO BE KEPT. The clerk shall maintain a public record listing fees awarded by the
court (1) to trustees and attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers and other professionals
employed by trustees, and (2) to examiners. The record shall include the name and docket number of
the case, the name of the individual or firm receiving the fee and the amount of the fee awarded. The
record shall be maintained chronologically and shall be kept current and open to examination by the
public without charge. "Trustees," as used in this rule, does not include debtors in possession.
(b) SUMMARY OF RECORD. At the close of each annual period, the clerk shall prepare a
summary of the public record by individual or firm name, to reflect total fees awarded during the
preceding year. The summary shall be open to examination by the public without charge. The clerk
shall transmit a copy of the summary to the United States trustee.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is adapted from former Rule 213. The first sentence of that rule is omitted because of the
provisions in 28 U.S.C. §§586 and 604(f) creating panels of private trustees.
The rule is not applicable to standing trustees serving in chapter 13 cases. See §1302 of the Code.
A basic purpose of the rule is to prevent what Congress has defined as "cronyism." Appointment or
employment, whether in a chapter 7 or 11 case, should not center among a small select group of individuals
unless the circumstances are such that it would be warranted. The public record of appointments to be kept by
the clerk will provide a means for monitoring the appointment process.
Subdivision (b) provides a convenient source for public review of fees paid from debtors' estates in the
bankruptcy courts. Thus, public recognition of appointments, fairly distributed and based on professional
qualifications and expertise, will be promoted and notions of improper favor dispelled. This rule is in keeping
with the findings of the Congressional subcommittees as set forth in the House Report of the Committee on
the Judiciary, No. 95–595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 89–99 (1977). These findings included the observations that
there were frequent appointments of the same person, contacts developed between the bankruptcy bar and the
courts, and an unusually close relationship between the bar and the judges developed over the years. A major
purpose of the new statute is to dilute these practices and instill greater public confidence in the system. Rule
2013 implements that laudatory purpose.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
In subdivisions (b) and (c) the word awarded is substituted for the word paid. While clerks do not know if
fees are paid, they can determine what fees are awarded by the court.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is deleted. The matter contained in this subdivision is more properly left for regulation by
[Release Point 118-106]
the United States trustee. When appointing trustees and examiners and when monitoring applications for
employment of auctioneers, appraisers and other professionals, the United States trustee should be sensitive to
disproportionate or excessive fees received by any person.
Subdivision (b), redesignated as subdivision (a), is amended to reflect the fact that the United States trustee
appoints examiners subject to court approval.
Subdivision (c), redesignated as subdivision (b), is amended to furnish the United States trustee with a copy
of the annual summary which may assist that office in the performance of its responsibilities under 28 U.S.C.
§586 and the Code.
The rule is not applicable to standing trustees serving in chapter 12 cases. See §1202 of the Code.
Rule 2014. Employment of Professional Persons
(a) APPLICATION FOR AND ORDER OF EMPLOYMENT. An order approving the
employment of attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, agents, or other professionals
pursuant to §327, §1103, or §1114 of the Code shall be made only on application of the trustee or
committee. The application shall be filed and, unless the case is a chapter 9 municipality case, a copy
of the application shall be transmitted by the applicant to the United States trustee. The application
shall state the specific facts showing the necessity for the employment, the name of the person to be
employed, the reasons for the selection, the professional services to be rendered, any proposed
arrangement for compensation, and, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, all of the person's
connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and
accountants, the United States trustee, or any person employed in the office of the United States
trustee. The application shall be accompanied by a verified statement of the person to be employed
setting forth the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their
respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, or any person employed in the office
of the United States trustee.
(b) SERVICES RENDERED BY MEMBER OR ASSOCIATE OF FIRM OF ATTORNEYS OR
ACCOUNTANTS. If, under the Code and this rule, a law partnership or corporation is employed as
an attorney, or an accounting partnership or corporation is employed as an accountant, or if a named
attorney or accountant is employed, any partner, member, or regular associate of the partnership,
corporation, or individual may act as attorney or accountant so employed, without further order of
the court.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a) is adapted from the second sentence of former Bankruptcy Rule 215(a). The remainder of
that rule is covered by §327 of the Code.
Subdivision (b) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 215(f). The compensation provisions are set forth
in §504 of the Code.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to include retention of professionals by committees of retired employees pursuant to
§1114 of the Code.
The United States trustee monitors applications filed under §327 of the Code and may file with the court
comments with respect to the approval of such applications. See 28 U.S.C. §586(a)(3)(H). The United States
trustee also monitors creditors' committees in accordance with 28 U.S.C. §586(a)(3)(E). The addition of the
second sentence of subdivision (a) is designed to enable the United States trustee to perform these duties.
Subdivision (a) is also amended to require disclosure of the professional's connections with the United
States trustee or persons employed in the United States trustee's office. This requirement is not intended to
prohibit the employment of such persons in all cases or to enlarge the definition of "disinterested person" in
§101(13) of the Code. However, the court may consider a connection with the United States trustee's office as
a factor when exercising its discretion. Also, this information should be revealed in the interest of full
disclosure and confidence in the bankruptcy system, especially since the United States trustee monitors and
may be heard on applications for compensation and reimbursement of professionals employed under this rule.
The United States trustee appoints committees pursuant to §1102 of the Code which is applicable in chapter
[Release Point 118-106]
9 cases under §901. In the interest of full disclosure and confidence in the bankruptcy system, a connection
between the United States trustee and a professional employed by the committee should be revealed in every
case, including a chapter 9 case. However, since the United States trustee does not have any role in the
employment of professionals in chapter 9 cases, it is not necessary in such cases to transmit to the United
States trustee a copy of the application under subdivision (a) of this rule. See 28 U.S.C. §586(a)(3)(H).
Rule 2015. Duty to Keep Records, Make Reports, and Give Notice of Case or
Change of Status
(a) TRUSTEE OR DEBTOR IN POSSESSION. A trustee or debtor in possession shall:
(1) in a chapter 7 liquidation case and, if the court directs, in a chapter 11 reorganization case
(other than under subchapter V), file and transmit to the United States trustee a complete inventory
of the property of the debtor within 30 days after qualifying as a trustee or debtor in possession,
unless such an inventory has already been filed;
(2) keep a record of receipts and the disposition of money and property received;
(3) file the reports and summaries required by §704(a)(8) of the Code, which shall include a
statement, if payments are made to employees, of the amounts of deductions for all taxes required
to be withheld or paid for and in behalf of employees and the place where these amounts are
deposited;
(4) as soon as possible after the commencement of the case, give notice of the case to every
entity known to be holding money or property subject to withdrawal or order of the debtor,
including every bank, savings or building and loan association, public utility company, and
landlord with whom the debtor has a deposit, and to every insurance company which has issued a
policy having a cash surrender value payable to the debtor, except that notice need not be given to
any entity who has knowledge or has previously been notified of the case;
(5) in a chapter 11 reorganization case (other than under subchapter V), on or before the last day
of the month after each calendar quarter during which there is a duty to pay fees under 28 U.S.C.
§1930(a)(6), file and transmit to the United States trustee a statement of any disbursements made
during that quarter and of any fees payable under 28 U.S.C. §1930(a)(6) for that quarter; and
(6) in a chapter 11 small business case, unless the court, for cause, sets another reporting
interval, file and transmit to the United States trustee for each calendar month after the order for
relief, on the appropriate Official Form, the report required by §308. If the order for relief is
within the first 15 days of a calendar month, a report shall be filed for the portion of the month that
follows the order for relief. If the order for relief is after the 15th day of a calendar month, the
period for the remainder of the month shall be included in the report for the next calendar month.
Each report shall be filed no later than 21 days after the last day of the calendar month following
the month covered by the report. The obligation to file reports under this subparagraph terminates
on the effective date of the plan, or conversion or dismissal of the case.
(b) TRUSTEE, DEBTOR IN POSSESSION, AND DEBTOR IN A CASE UNDER
SUBCHAPTER V OF CHAPTER 11. In a case under subchapter V of chapter 11, the debtor in
possession shall perform the duties prescribed in (a)(2)–(4) and, if the court directs, shall file and
transmit to the United States trustee a complete inventory of the debtor's property within the time
fixed by the court. If the debtor is removed as debtor in possession, the trustee shall perform the
duties of the debtor in possession prescribed in this subdivision (b). The debtor shall perform the
duties prescribed in (a)(6).
(c) CHAPTER 12 TRUSTEE AND DEBTOR IN POSSESSION. In a chapter 12 family farmer's
debt adjustment case, the debtor in possession shall perform the duties prescribed in clauses (2)–(4)
of subdivision (a) of this rule and, if the court directs, shall file and transmit to the United States
trustee a complete inventory of the property of the debtor within the time fixed by the court. If the
debtor is removed as debtor in possession, the trustee shall perform the duties of the debtor in
possession prescribed in this subdivision (c).
(d) CHAPTER 13 TRUSTEE AND DEBTOR.
[Release Point 118-106]
(1) Business Cases. In a chapter 13 individual's debt adjustment case, when the debtor is
engaged in business, the debtor shall perform the duties prescribed by clauses (2)–(4) of
subdivision (a) of this rule and, if the court directs, shall file and transmit to the United States
trustee a complete inventory of the property of the debtor within the time fixed by the court.
(2) Nonbusiness Cases. In a chapter 13 individual's debt adjustment case, when the debtor is not
engaged in business, the trustee shall perform the duties prescribed by clause (2) of subdivision (a)
of this rule.
(e) FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVE. In a case in which the court has granted recognition of a
foreign proceeding under chapter 15, the foreign representative shall file any notice required under
§1518 of the Code within 14 days after the date when the representative becomes aware of the
subsequent information.
(f) TRANSMISSION OF REPORTS. In a chapter 11 case the court may direct that copies or
summaries of annual reports and copies or summaries of other reports shall be mailed to the
creditors, equity security holders, and indenture trustees. The court may also direct the publication of
summaries of any such reports. A copy of every report or summary mailed or published pursuant to
this subdivision shall be transmitted to the United States trustee.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule combines the provisions found in former Rules 218, 10–208, 11–30 and 13–208 of the Rules of
Bankruptcy Procedure. It specifies various duties which are in addition to those required by §§704, 1106,
1302 and 1304 of the Code.
In subdivision (a) the times permitted to be fixed by the court in clause (3) for the filing of reports and
summaries may be fixed by local rule or order.
Subdivision (b). This subdivision prescribes duties on either the debtor or trustee in chapter 13 cases,
depending on whether or not the debtor is engaged in business (§1304 of the Code). The duty of giving notice
prescribed by subdivision (a)(4) is not included in a nonbusiness case because of its impracticability.
Subdivision (c) is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10–208(c) which, in turn, was derived from §190 of
the Act. The equity security holders to whom the reports should be sent are those of record at the time of
transmittal of such reports.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to add as a duty of the trustee or debtor in possession the filing of a notice of or
a copy of the petition. The filing of such notice or a copy of the petition is essential to the protection of the
estate from unauthorized post-petition conveyances of real property. Section 549(c) of the Code protects the
title of a good faith purchaser for fair equivalent value unless the notice or copy of the petition is filed.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to provide the United States trustee with information needed to perform supervisory
responsibilities in accordance with 28 U.S.C. §586(a)(3) and to exercise the right to raise, appear and be heard
on issues pursuant to §307 of the Code.
Subdivision (a)(3) is amended to conform to the 1986 amendments to §704(8) of the Code and the United
States trustee system. It may not be necessary for the court to fix a time to file reports if the United States
trustee requests that they be filed within a specified time and there is no dispute regarding such time.
Subdivision (a)(5) is deleted because the filing of a notice of or copy of the petition to protect real property
against unauthorized postpetition transfers in a particular case is within the discretion of the trustee.
The new subdivision (a)(5) was added to enable the United States trustee, parties in interest, and the court to
determine the appropriate quarterly fee required by 28 U.S.C. §1930(a)(6). The requirements of subdivision
(a)(5) should be satisfied whenever possible by including this information in other reports filed by the trustee
or debtor in possession. Nonpayment of the fee may result in dismissal or conversion of the case pursuant to
§1112(b) of the Code.
Rule X–1007(b), which provides that the trustee or debtor in possession shall cooperate with the United
States trustee by furnishing information that the United States trustee reasonably requires, is deleted as
unnecessary. The deletion of Rule X–1007(b) should not be construed as a limitation of the powers of the
[Release Point 118-106]
United States trustee or of the duty of the trustee or debtor in possession to cooperate with the United States
trustee in the performance of the statutory responsibilities of that office.
Subdivision (a)(6) is abrogated as unnecessary. See §1106(a)(7) of the Code.
Subdivision (a)(7) is abrogated. The closing of a chapter 11 case is governed by Rule 3022.
New subdivision (b), which prescribes the duties of the debtor in possession and trustee in a chapter 12
case, does not prohibit additional reporting requirements pursuant to local rule or court order.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1996 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a)(1) provides that the trustee in a chapter 7 case and, if the court directs, the trustee or debtor
in possession in a chapter 11 case, is required to file and transmit to the United States trustee a complete
inventory of the debtor's property within 30 days after qualifying as trustee or debtor in possession, unless
such an inventory has already been filed. Subdivisions (b) and (c) are amended to clarify that a debtor in
possession and trustee in a chapter 12 case, and a debtor in a chapter 13 case where the debtor is engaged in
business, are not required to file and transmit to the United States trustee a complete inventory of the property
of the debtor unless the court so directs. If the court so directs, the court also fixes the time limit for filing and
transmitting the inventory.
GAP Report on Rule 2015. No changes since publication, except for a stylistic change in the first sentence
of the committee note.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2002 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a)(5) is amended to provide that the duty to file quarterly disbursement reports continues only
so long as there is an obligation to make quarterly payments to the United States trustee under 28 U.S.C.
§1930(a)(6).
Other amendments are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Subparagraph (a)(6) implements §308 of the Code, added by the 2005 amendments. That section requires
small business chapter 11 debtors to file periodic financial and operating reports, and the rule sets the time for
filing those reports and requires the use of an Official Form for the report. The obligation to file reports under
this rule does not relieve the trustee or debtor of any other obligations to provide information or documents to
the United States trustee.
The rule also is amended to fix the time for the filing of notices under §1518, added to the Code in 2005.
Former subdivision (d) is renumbered as subdivision (e).
Other changes are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2012 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a)(3). Subdivision (a)(3) is amended to correct the reference to §704. The 2005 amendments to
the Code expanded §704 and created subsections within it. The provision that was previously §704(8) became
§704(a)(8). The other change to (a)(3) is stylistic.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended in response to the enactment of the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, Pub.
L. No. 116–54, 133 Stat. 1079. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to be a debtor
under subchapter V of chapter 11. Subdivision (b) is amended to prescribe the duties of a debtor in possession,
[Release Point 118-106]
trustee, and debtor in a subchapter V case. Those cases are excepted from subdivision (a) because, unlike
other chapter 11 cases, there will generally be both a trustee and a debtor in possession. Subdivision (b) also
reflects that §1187 of the Code prescribes reporting duties for the debtor in a subchapter V case.
Former subdivisions (b), (c), (d), and (e) are redesignated (c), (d), (e), and (f)[,] respectively.
Rule 2015.1. Patient Care Ombudsman
(a) REPORTS. A patient care ombudsman, at least 14 days before making a report under
§333(b)(2) of the Code, shall give notice that the report will be made to the court, unless the court
orders otherwise. The notice shall be transmitted to the United States trustee, posted conspicuously at
the health care facility that is the subject of the report, and served on: the debtor; the trustee; all
patients; and any committee elected under §705 or appointed under §1102 of the Code or its
authorized agent, or, if the case is a chapter 9 municipality case or a chapter 11 reorganization case
and no committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed under §1102, on the creditors included
on the list filed under Rule 1007(d); and such other entities as the court may direct. The notice shall
state the date and time when the report will be made, the manner in which the report will be made,
and, if the report is in writing, the name, address, telephone number, email address, and website, if
any, of the person from whom a copy of the report may be obtained at the debtor's expense.
(b) AUTHORIZATION TO REVIEW CONFIDENTIAL PATIENT RECORDS. A motion by a
patient care ombudsman under §333(c) to review confidential patient records shall be governed by
Rule 9014, served on the patient and any family member or other contact person whose name and
address have been given to the trustee or the debtor for the purpose of providing information
regarding the patient's health care, and transmitted to the United States trustee subject to applicable
nonbankruptcy law relating to patient privacy. Unless the court orders otherwise, a hearing on the
motion may not be commenced earlier than 14 days after service of the motion.
(Added Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; amended Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008
This rule is new and implements §333 of the Code, added by the 2005 amendments. Subdivision (a) is
designed to give parties in interest, including patients or their representatives, sufficient notice so that they
will be able to review written reports or attend hearings at which reports are made. The rule permits a notice to
relate to a single report or to periodic reports to be given during the case. For example, the ombudsman may
give notice that reports will be made at specified intervals or dates during the case.
Subdivision (a) of the rule also requires that the notice be posted conspicuously at the health care facility in
a place where it will be seen by patients and their families or others visiting the patients. This may require
posting in common areas and patient rooms within the facility. Because health care facilities and the patients
they serve can vary greatly, the locations of the posted notice should be tailored to the specific facility that is
the subject of the report.
Subdivision (b) requires the ombudsman to notify the patient and the United States trustee that the
ombudsman is seeking access to confidential patient records so that they will be able to appear and be heard
on the matter. This procedure should assist the court in reaching its decision both as to access to the records
and appropriate restrictions on that access to ensure continued confidentiality. Notices given under this rule
are subject to the provisions of applicable federal and state law that relate to the protection of patients' privacy,
such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104–191 (HIPAA).
Changes Made After Publication. Two stylistic changes were made to the rule. The reference to the court's
authority to order otherwise was moved from the beginning to the end of the first sentence of subdivision (a).
On line 19, the word "patient" was substituted for "health" to be consistent with the Code.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
[Release Point 118-106]
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
Rule 2015.2. Transfer of Patient in Health Care Business Case
Unless the court orders otherwise, if the debtor is a health care business, the trustee may not
transfer a patient to another health care business under §704(a)(12) of the Code unless the trustee
gives at least 14 days' notice of the transfer to the patient care ombudsman, if any, the patient, and
any family member or other contact person whose name and address has been given to the trustee or
the debtor for the purpose of providing information regarding the patient's health care. The notice is
subject to applicable nonbankruptcy law relating to patient privacy.
(Added Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; amended Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008
This rule is new. Section 704(a)(12), added to the Code by the 2005 amendments, authorizes the trustee to
relocate patients when a health care business debtor's facility is in the process of being closed. The Code
permits the trustee to take this action without the need for any court order, but the notice required by this rule
will enable a patient care ombudsman appointed under §333, or a patient who contends that the trustee's
actions violate §704(a)(12), to have those issues resolved before the patient is transferred.
This rule also permits the court to enter an order dispensing with or altering the notice requirement in
proper circumstances. For example, a facility could be closed immediately, or very quickly, such that 10 days'
notice would not be possible in some instances. In that event, the court may shorten the time required for
notice.
Notices given under this rule are subject to the provisions of applicable federal and state law that relate to
the protection of patients' privacy, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,
Pub. L. No. 104–191 (HIPAA).
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
Rule 2015.3. Reports of Financial Information on Entities in Which a Chapter 11
Estate Holds a Controlling or Substantial Interest
(a) REPORTING REQUIREMENT. In a chapter 11 case, the trustee or debtor in possession shall
file periodic financial reports of the value, operations, and profitability of each entity that is not a
publicly traded corporation or a debtor in a case under title 11, and in which the estate holds a
substantial or controlling interest. The reports shall be prepared as prescribed by the appropriate
Official Form, and shall be based upon the most recent information reasonably available to the
trustee or debtor in possession.
(b) TIME FOR FILING; SERVICE. The first report required by this rule shall be filed no later
than seven days before the first date set for the meeting of creditors under §341 of the Code.
Subsequent reports shall be filed no less frequently than every six months thereafter, until the
effective date of a plan or the case is dismissed or converted. Copies of the report shall be served on
the United States trustee, any committee appointed under §1102 of the Code, and any other party in
interest that has filed a request therefor.
[Release Point 118-106]
(c) PRESUMPTION OF SUBSTANTIAL OR CONTROLLING INTEREST; JUDICIAL
DETERMINATION. For purposes of this rule, an entity of which the estate controls or owns at least
a 20 percent interest, shall be presumed to be an entity in which the estate has a substantial or
controlling interest. An entity in which the estate controls or owns less than a 20 percent interest
shall be presumed not to be an entity in which the estate has a substantial or controlling interest.
Upon motion, the entity, any holder of an interest therein, the United States trustee, or any other
party in interest may seek to rebut either presumption, and the court shall, after notice and a hearing,
determine whether the estate's interest in the entity is substantial or controlling.
(d) MODIFICATION OF REPORTING REQUIREMENT. The court may, after notice and a
hearing, vary the reporting requirement established by subdivision (a) of this rule for cause,
including that the trustee or debtor in possession is not able, after a good faith effort, to comply with
those reporting requirements, or that the information required by subdivision (a) is publicly
available.
(e) NOTICE AND PROTECTIVE ORDERS. No later than 14 days before filing the first report
required by this rule, the trustee or debtor in possession shall send notice to the entity in which the
estate has a substantial or controlling interest, and to all holders—known to the trustee or debtor in
possession—of an interest in that entity, that the trustee or debtor in possession expects to file and
serve financial information relating to the entity in accordance with this rule. The entity in which the
estate has a substantial or controlling interest, or a person holding an interest in that entity, may
request protection of the information under §107 of the Code.
(f) EFFECT OF REQUEST. Unless the court orders otherwise, the pendency of a request under
subdivisions (c), (d), or (e) of this rule shall not alter or stay the requirements of subdivision (a).
(Added Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; amended Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008
This rule implements §419 of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005
("BAPCPA"). Reports are to be made on the appropriate Official Form. While §419 of BAPCPA places the
obligation to report upon the "debtor," this rule extends the obligation to include cases in which a trustee has
been appointed. The court can order that the reports not be filed in appropriate circumstances, such as when
the information that would be included in these reports is already available to interested parties.
Changes After Publication. In subdivision (e), the 20 day period was changed to 14 days. This better
reconciles the timing of the notice and the scheduling of the §341 meeting of creditors, and it is also consistent
with the upcoming time computation amendments.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
Rule 2016. Compensation for Services Rendered and Reimbursement of
Expenses
(a) APPLICATION FOR COMPENSATION OR REIMBURSEMENT. An entity seeking interim
or final compensation for services, or reimbursement of necessary expenses, from the estate shall file
an application setting forth a detailed statement of (1) the services rendered, time expended and
expenses incurred, and (2) the amounts requested. An application for compensation shall include a
statement as to what payments have theretofore been made or promised to the applicant for services
rendered or to be rendered in any capacity whatsoever in connection with the case, the source of the
[Release Point 118-106]
compensation so paid or promised, whether any compensation previously received has been shared
and whether an agreement or understanding exists between the applicant and any other entity for the
sharing of compensation received or to be received for services rendered in or in connection with the
case, and the particulars of any sharing of compensation or agreement or understanding therefor,
except that details of any agreement by the applicant for the sharing of compensation as a member or
regular associate of a firm of lawyers or accountants shall not be required. The requirements of this
subdivision shall apply to an application for compensation for services rendered by an attorney or
accountant even though the application is filed by a creditor or other entity. Unless the case is a
chapter 9 municipality case, the applicant shall transmit to the United States trustee a copy of the
application.
(b) DISCLOSURE OF COMPENSATION PAID OR PROMISED TO ATTORNEY FOR
DEBTOR. Every attorney for a debtor, whether or not the attorney applies for compensation, shall
file and transmit to the United States trustee within 14 days after the order for relief, or at another
time as the court may direct, the statement required by §329 of the Code including whether the
attorney has shared or agreed to share the compensation with any other entity. The statement shall
include the particulars of any such sharing or agreement to share by the attorney, but the details of
any agreement for the sharing of the compensation with a member or regular associate of the
attorney's law firm shall not be required. A supplemental statement shall be filed and transmitted to
the United States trustee within 14 days after any payment or agreement not previously disclosed.
(c) DISCLOSURE OF COMPENSATION PAID OR PROMISED TO BANKRUPTCY
PETITION PREPARER. Before a petition is filed, every bankruptcy petition preparer for a debtor
shall deliver to the debtor, the declaration under penalty of perjury required by §110(h)(2). The
declaration shall disclose any fee, and the source of any fee, received from or on behalf of the debtor
within 12 months of the filing of the case and all unpaid fees charged to the debtor. The declaration
shall also describe the services performed and documents prepared or caused to be prepared by the
bankruptcy petition preparer. The declaration shall be filed with the petition. The petition preparer
shall file a supplemental statement within 14 days after any payment or agreement not previously
disclosed.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Mar. 27, 2003, eff.
Dec. 1, 2003; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Rule 219. Many of the former rule's requirements are, however, set forth in
the Code. Section 329 requires disclosure by an attorney of transactions with the debtor, §330 sets forth the
bases for allowing compensation, and §504 prohibits sharing of compensation. This rule implements those
various provisions.
Subdivision (a) includes within its provisions a committee, member thereof, agent, attorney or accountant
for the committee when compensation or reimbursement of expenses is sought from the estate.
Regular associate of a law firm is defined in Rule 9001(9) to include any attorney regularly employed by,
associated with, or counsel to that law firm. Firm is defined in Rule 9001(6) to include a partnership or
professional corporation.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to change "person" to "entity". There are occasions in which a governmental
unit may be entitled to file an application under this rule. The requirement that the application contain a
"detailed statement of services rendered, time expended and expenses incurred" gives to the court authority to
ensure that the application is both comprehensive and detailed. No amendments are made to delineate further
the requirements of the application because the amount of detail to be furnished is a function of the nature of
the services rendered and the complexity of the case.
Subdivision (b) is amended to require that the attorney for the debtor file the §329 statement before the
meeting of creditors. This will assist the parties in conducting the examination of the debtor. In addition, the
amended rule requires the attorney to supplement the §329 statement if an undisclosed payment is made to the
attorney or a new or amended agreement is entered into by the debtor and the attorney.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to enable the United States trustee to perform the duty to monitor applications
[Release Point 118-106]
for compensation and reimbursement filed under §330 of the Code. See 28 U.S.C. §586(a)(3)(A).
Subdivision (b) is amended to give the United States trustee the information needed to determine whether to
request appropriate relief based on excessive fees under §329(b) of the Code. See Rule 2017.
The words "with the court" are deleted in subdivisions (a) and (b) as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and
9001(3).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2003 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended by adding subdivision (c) to implement §110(h)(1) of the Code.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
Subdivision (c) is amended to reflect the 2005 amendment to §110(h)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code which
now requires that the declaration be filed with the petition. The statute previously required that the petition
preparer file the declaration within 10 days after the filing of the petition. The amendment to the rule also
corrects the cross reference to §110(h)(1), which was redesignated as subparagraph (h)(2) of §110 by the 2005
amendment to the Code.
Other changes are stylistic.
Rule 2017. Examination of Debtor's Transactions with Debtor's Attorney
(a) PAYMENT OR TRANSFER TO ATTORNEY BEFORE ORDER FOR RELIEF. On motion
by any party in interest or on the court's own initiative, the court after notice and a hearing may
determine whether any payment of money or any transfer of property by the debtor, made directly or
indirectly and in contemplation of the filing of a petition under the Code by or against the debtor or
before entry of the order for relief in an involuntary case, to an attorney for services rendered or to be
rendered is excessive.
(b) PAYMENT OR TRANSFER TO ATTORNEY AFTER ORDER FOR RELIEF. On motion by
the debtor, the United States trustee, or on the court's own initiative, the court after notice and a
hearing may determine whether any payment of money or any transfer of property, or any agreement
therefor, by the debtor to an attorney after entry of an order for relief in a case under the Code is
excessive, whether the payment or transfer is made or is to be made directly or indirectly, if the
payment, transfer, or agreement therefor is for services in any way related to the case.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from §60d of the Act and former Bankruptcy Rule 220 and implements §329 of the
Code. Information required to be disclosed by the attorney for a debtor by §329 of the Code and by the debtor
in his Statement of Financial Affairs (Item #15 of Form No. 7, Item #20 of Form No. 8) will assist the court in
determining whether to proceed under this rule. Section 60d was enacted in recognition of "the temptation of a
failing debtor to deal too liberally with his property in employing counsel to protect him in view of financial
reverses and probable failure." In re Wood & Henderson, 210 U.S. 246, 253 (1908). This rule, like §60d of the
Act and §329 of the Code, is premised on the need for and appropriateness of judicial scrutiny of
arrangements between a debtor and his attorney to protect the creditors of the estate and the debtor against
overreaching by an officer of the court who is in a peculiarly advantageous position to impose on both the
creditors and his client. 2 Collier, Bankruptcy 329.02 (15th ed. 1980); MacLachlan, Bankruptcy 318 (1956).
Rule 9014 applies to any contested matter arising under this rule.
This rule is not to be construed to permit post-petition payments or transfers which may be avoided under
[Release Point 118-106]
other provisions of the Code.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to include within subdivision (a) a payment or transfer of property by the debtor to an
attorney after the filing of an involuntary petition but before the order for relief. Any party in interest should
be able to make a motion for a determination of whether such payment or transfer is excessive because the
funds or property transferred may be property of the estate.
The United States trustee supervises and monitors the administration of bankruptcy cases other than chapter
9 cases and pursuant to §307 of the Code may raise, appear and be heard on issues relating to fees paid to the
debtor's attorney. It is consistent with that role to expect the United States trustee to review statements filed
under Rule 2016(b) and to file motions relating to excessive fees pursuant to §329 of the Code.
Rule 2018. Intervention; Right to Be Heard
(a) PERMISSIVE INTERVENTION. In a case under the Code, after hearing on such notice as the
court directs and for cause shown, the court may permit any interested entity to intervene generally
or with respect to any specified matter.
(b) INTERVENTION BY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF A STATE. In a chapter 7, 11, 12, or 13
case, the Attorney General of a State may appear and be heard on behalf of consumer creditors if the
court determines the appearance is in the public interest, but the Attorney General may not appeal
from any judgment, order, or decree in the case.
(c) CHAPTER 9 MUNICIPALITY CASE. The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States
may, or if requested by the court shall, intervene in a chapter 9 case. Representatives of the state in
which the debtor is located may intervene in a chapter 9 case with respect to matters specified by the
court.
(d) LABOR UNIONS. In a chapter 9, 11, or 12 case, a labor union or employees' association,
representative of employees of the debtor, shall have the right to be heard on the economic
soundness of a plan affecting the interests of the employees. A labor union or employees' association
which exercises its right to be heard under this subdivision shall not be entitled to appeal any
judgment, order, or decree relating to the plan, unless otherwise permitted by law.
(e) SERVICE ON ENTITIES COVERED BY THIS RULE. The court may enter orders governing
the service of notice and papers on entities permitted to intervene or be heard pursuant to this rule.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Rules 8–210, 9–15 and 10–210 and it implements §§1109 and 1164 of the
Code.
Pursuant to §1109 of the Code, parties in interest have a right to be heard and the Securities and Exchange
Commission may raise and be heard on any issue but it may not take an appeal. That section is applicable in
chapter 9 cases (§901 of the Code) and in chapter 11 cases, including cases under subchapter IV thereof for
the reorganization of a railroad.
In a railroad reorganization case under subchapter IV of chapter 11, §1164 also gives the right to be heard
to the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Department of Transportation and any state or local regulatory
commission with jurisdiction over the debtor, but these entities may not appeal.
This rule does not apply in adversary proceedings. For intervention in adversary proceedings, see Rule
7024. The rules do not provide any right of compensation to or reimbursement of expenses for intervenors or
others covered by this rule. Section 503(b)(3)(D) and (4) is not applicable to the entities covered by this rule.
Subdivision (a) is derived from former Chapter VIII Rule 8–210 and former Chapter X Rule 10–210. It
permits intervention of an entity (see §101(14), (21) of the Code) not otherwise entitled to do so under the
Code or this rule. Such a party seeking to intervene must show cause therefor.
Subdivision (b) specifically grants the appropriate state's Attorney General the right to appear and be heard
on behalf of consumer creditors when it is in the public interest. See House Rep. No. 95–595, 95th Cong., 1st
Sess. (1977) 189. While "consumer creditor" is not defined in the Code or elsewhere, it would include the type
of individual entitled to priority under §507(a)(5) of the Code, that is, an individual who has deposited money
[Release Point 118-106]
for the purchase, lease or rental of property or the purchase of services for the personal, family, or household
use of the individual. It would also include individuals who purchased or leased property for such purposes in
connection with which there may exist claims for breach of warranty.
This subdivision does not grant the Attorney General the status of party in interest. In other contexts, the
Attorney General will, of course, be a party in interest as for example, in representing a state in connection
with a tax claim.
Subdivision (c) recognizes the possible interests of the Secretary of the Treasury or of the state of the
debtor's locale when a municipality is the debtor. It is derived from former Chapter IX Rule 9–15 and §85(d)
of the Act.
Subdivision (d) is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10–210 which, in turn, was derived from §206 of the
Act. Section 206 has no counterpart in the Code.
Subdivision (e) is derived from former Chapter VIII Rule 8–210(d). It gives the court flexibility in directing
the type of future notices to be given intervenors.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (d) is amended to make it clear that the prohibition against appeals by labor unions is limited
only to their participation in connection with the hearings on the plan as provided in subdivision (d). If a labor
union would otherwise have the right to file an appeal or to be a party to an appeal, this rule does not preclude
the labor union from exercising that right.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivisions (b) and (d) are amended to include chapter 12.
Rule 2019. Disclosure Regarding Creditors and Equity Security Holders in
Chapter 9 and Chapter 11 Cases
(a) DEFINITIONS. In this rule the following terms have the meanings indicated:
(1) "Disclosable economic interest" means any claim, interest, pledge, lien, option,
participation, derivative instrument, or any other right or derivative right granting the holder an
economic interest that is affected by the value, acquisition, or disposition of a claim or interest.
(2) "Represent" or "represents" means to take a position before the court or to solicit votes
regarding the confirmation of a plan on behalf of another.
(b) DISCLOSURE BY GROUPS, COMMITTEES, AND ENTITIES.
(1) In a chapter 9 or 11 case, a verified statement setting forth the information specified in
subdivision (c) of this rule shall be filed by every group or committee that consists of or
represents, and every entity that represents, multiple creditors or equity security holders that are
(A) acting in concert to advance their common interests, and (B) not composed entirely of
affiliates or insiders of one another.
(2) Unless the court orders otherwise, an entity is not required to file the verified statement
described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision solely because of its status as:
(A) an indenture trustee;
(B) an agent for one or more other entities under an agreement for the extension of credit;
(C) a class action representative; or
(D) a governmental unit that is not a person.
(c) INFORMATION REQUIRED. The verified statement shall include:
(1) the pertinent facts and circumstances concerning:
(A) with respect to a group or committee, other than a committee appointed under §1102 or
§1114 of the Code, the formation of the group or committee, including the name of each entity
at whose instance the group or committee was formed or for whom the group or committee has
agreed to act; or
(B) with respect to an entity, the employment of the entity, including the name of each
creditor or equity security holder at whose instance the employment was arranged;
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) if not disclosed under subdivision (c)(1), with respect to an entity, and with respect to each
member of a group or committee:
(A) name and address;
(B) the nature and amount of each disclosable economic interest held in relation to the debtor
as of the date the entity was employed or the group or committee was formed; and
(C) with respect to each member of a group or committee that claims to represent any entity
in addition to the members of the group or committee, other than a committee appointed under
§1102 or §1114 of the Code, the date of acquisition by quarter and year of each disclosable
economic interest, unless acquired more than one year before the petition was filed;
(3) if not disclosed under subdivision (c)(1) or (c)(2), with respect to each creditor or equity
security holder represented by an entity, group, or committee, other than a committee appointed
under §1102 or §1114 of the Code:
(A) name and address; and
(B) the nature and amount of each disclosable economic interest held in relation to the debtor
as of the date of the statement; and
(4) a copy of the instrument, if any, authorizing the entity, group, or committee to act on behalf
of creditors or equity security holders.
(d) SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENTS. If any fact disclosed in its most recently filed statement
has changed materially, an entity, group, or committee shall file a verified supplemental statement
whenever it takes a position before the court or solicits votes on the confirmation of a plan. The
supplemental statement shall set forth the material changes in the facts required by subdivision (c) to
be disclosed.
(e) DETERMINATION OF FAILURE TO COMPLY; SANCTIONS.
(1) On motion of any party in interest, or on its own motion, the court may determine whether
there has been a failure to comply with any provision of this rule.
(2) If the court finds such a failure to comply, it may:
(A) refuse to permit the entity, group, or committee to be heard or to intervene in the case;
(B) hold invalid any authority, acceptance, rejection, or objection given, procured, or
received by the entity, group, or committee; or
(C) grant other appropriate relief.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 26, 2011, eff.
Dec. 1, 2011.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is a comprehensive regulation of representation in chapter 9 municipality and in chapter 11
reorganization cases. It is derived from §§209–213 of the Act and former Chapter X Rule 10–211.
Subdivision (b) is derived from §§212, 213 of the Act. As used in clause (2), "other authorization" would
include a power or warrant of attorney which are specifically mentioned in §212 of the Act. This rule deals
with representation provisions in mortgages, trust deeds, etc. to protect the beneficiaries from unfair practices
and the like. It does not deal with the validation or invalidation of security interests generally. If immediate
compliance is not possible, the court may permit a representative to be heard on a specific matter, but there is
no implicit waiver of compliance on a permanent basis.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to exclude from the requirements of this rule committees of retired employees
appointed pursuant to §1114 of the Code. The words "with the clerk" are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules
5005(a) and 9001(3).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2011 AMENDMENT
The rule is substantially amended to expand the scope of its coverage and the content of its disclosure
requirements. Stylistic and organizational changes are also made in order to provide greater clarity. Because
the rule no longer applies only to representatives of creditors and equity security holders, the title of the rule
[Release Point 118-106]
has been changed to reflect its broadened focus on disclosure of financial information in chapter 9 and chapter
11 cases.
Subdivision (a). The content of subdivision (a) is new. It sets forth two definitions. The first is the definition
of the term "disclosable economic interest," which is used in subdivisions (c)(2) and (c)(3). The definition of
the term is intended to be sufficiently broad to cover any economic interest that could affect the legal and
strategic positions a stakeholder takes in a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case. A disclosable economic interest
extends beyond claims and interests owned by a stakeholder and includes, among other types of holdings,
short positions, credit default swaps, and total return swaps.
The second definition is of "represent" or "represents." The definition provides that representation requires
active participation in the case or in a proceeding on behalf of another entity—either by taking a position on a
matter before the court or by soliciting votes on the confirmation of a plan. Thus, for example, an attorney
who is retained and consulted by a creditor or equity security holder to monitor the case, but who does not
advocate any position before the court or engage in solicitation activities on behalf of that client, does not
represent the creditor or equity security holder for purposes of this rule.
Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b)(1) specifies who is covered by the rule's disclosure requirements. In
addition to an entity, group, or committee that represents more than one creditor or equity security holder, the
amendment extends the rule's coverage to groups or committees that consist of more than one creditor or
equity security holder. The rule no longer excludes official committees, except as specifically indicated. The
rule applies to a group of creditors or equity security holders that act in concert to advance common interests
(except when the group consists exclusively of affiliates or insiders of one another), even if the group does not
call itself a committee.
Subdivision (b)(2) excludes certain entities from the rule's coverage. Even though these entities may
represent multiple creditors or equity security holders, they do so under formal legal arrangements of trust or
contract law that preclude them from acting on the basis of conflicting economic interests. For example, an
indenture trustee's responsibilities are defined by the indenture, and individual interests of bondholders would
not affect the trustee's representation.
Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) sets forth the information that must be included in a verified statement
required to be filed under this rule. Subdivision (c)(1) continues to require disclosure concerning the formation
of a committee or group, other than an official committee, and the employment of an entity.
Subdivision (c)(2) specifies information that must be disclosed with respect to the entity and each member
of the committee and group filing the statement. In the case of a committee or group, the information about
the nature and amount of a disclosable economic interest must be specifically provided on a
member-by-member basis, and not in the aggregate. The quarter and year in which each disclosable economic
interest was acquired by each member of a committee or group (other than an official committee) that claims
to represent others must also be specifically provided, except for a disclosable economic interest acquired
more than a year before the filing of the petition. Although the rule no longer requires the disclosure of the
precise date of acquisition or the amount paid for disclosable economic interests, nothing in this rule precludes
either the discovery of that information or its disclosure when ordered by the court pursuant to authority
outside this rule.
Subdivision (c)(3) specifies information that must be disclosed with respect to creditors or equity security
holders that are represented by an entity, group, or committee. This provision does not apply with respect to
those represented by official committees. The information required to be disclosed under subdivision (c)(3)
parallels that required to be disclosed under subdivision (c)(2)(A) and (B). The amendment also clarifies that
under (c)(3) the nature and amount of each disclosable economic interest of represented creditors and
shareholders must be stated as of the date of the verified statement.
Subdivision (c)(4) requires the attachment of any instrument authorizing the filer of the verified statement
to act on behalf of creditors or equity security holders.
Subdivision (d). Subdivision (d) requires the filing of a supplemental statement at the time an entity, group,
or committee takes a position before the court or solicits votes on a plan if there has been a material change in
any of the information contained in its last filed statement. The supplemental verified statement must set forth
the material changes that have occurred regarding the information required to be disclosed by subdivision (c)
of this rule.
Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) addresses the court's authority to determine whether there has been a
violation of this rule and to impose a sanction for any violation. It no longer addresses the court's authority to
determine violations of other applicable laws regulating the activities and personnel of an entity, group, or
committee.
Changes Made After Publication.
Subdivision (a). A definition of "represent" or "represents" was added, and the subdivision was divided into
[Release Point 118-106]
paragraphs (1) and (2).
Subdivision (b). The provision authorizing the court to require disclosure by an entity that seeks or opposes
the granting of relief was deleted.
In the paragraph now designated as (1), language was added providing that groups, committees, and entities
are covered by the rule only if they consist of or represent multiple creditors or equity security holders "that
are (A) acting in concert to advance their common interests, and (B) not composed entirely of affiliates or
insiders of one another." The phrase "and, unless the court directs otherwise, every indenture trustee," was
deleted.
Subdivision (b)(2) was added to specify entities that are not required to file a verified statement merely
because they act in one of the designated capacities.
Subdivision (c). The authorization in subdivision (c)(2)(B) and (c)(3)(B) for the court to require the
disclosure of the amount paid for a disclosable economic interest was deleted.
The requirement in subdivision (c)(2)(C) and (c)(3)(C) for disclosure of the acquisition date of each
disclosable economic interest was modified. The requirement was made applicable only to members of an
unofficial group or committee that claims to represent any entity in addition to the members of the group or
committee, and the date that must be disclosed was limited to the quarter and year of acquisition.
Subdivision (d). The requirement of monthly supplementation of a verified statement was modified to
require supplementation whenever a covered group, committee, or entity takes a position before the court or
solicits votes on the confirmation of a plan and there has been a material change in any fact disclosed in its
most recently filed statement.
Subdivision (e). The provisions published as subdivision (e)(1)(B) and (C), which authorized the court to
determine failures to comply with legal requirements other than those imposed by Rule 2019, were deleted.
Subdivision (e)(2), which enumerated the materials the court could examine in making a determination of
noncompliance, was deleted.
Committee Note. In the discussion of the definition of "disclosable economic interest," the specific
examples of "short positions, credit default swaps, and total return swaps" were added to illustrate the breadth
of the definition. A sentence was added to the discussion of subdivision (c)(2) that states that the rule does not
affect the right of a party to obtain information by means of discovery or as ordered by the court under any
authority outside the rule.
Other changes. Stylistic and organizational changes were made throughout the rule and Committee Note to
reduce the length and clarify the meaning of the published proposal.
Rule 2020. Review of Acts by United States Trustee
A proceeding to contest any act or failure to act by the United States trustee is governed by Rule
9014.
(Added Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991
The United States trustee performs administrative functions, such as the convening of the meeting of
creditors and the appointment of trustees and committees. Most of the acts of the United States trustee are not
controversial and will go unchallenged. However, the United States trustee is not a judicial officer and does
not resolve disputes regarding the propriety of its own actions. This rule, which is new, provides a procedure
for judicial review of the United States trustee's acts or failure to act in connection with the administration of
the case. For example, if the United States trustee schedules a §341 meeting to be held 90 days after the
petition is filed, and a party in interest wishes to challenge the propriety of that act in view of §341(a) of the
Code and Rule 2003 which requires that the meeting be held not more than 40 days after the order for relief,
this rule permits the party to do so by motion.
This rule provides for review of acts already committed by the United States trustee, but does not provide
for advisory opinions in advance of the act. This rule is not intended to limit the discretion of the United States
trustee, provided that the United States trustee's act is authorized by, and in compliance with, the Code, title
28, these rules, and other applicable law.
PART III—CLAIMS AND DISTRIBUTION TO CREDITORS AND EQUITY
[Release Point 118-106]
INTEREST HOLDERS; PLANS
Rule 3001. Proof of Claim
(a) FORM AND CONTENT. A proof of claim is a written statement setting forth a creditor's
claim. A proof of claim shall conform substantially to the appropriate Official Form.
(b) WHO MAY EXECUTE. A proof of claim shall be executed by the creditor or the creditor's
authorized agent except as provided in Rules 3004 and 3005.
(c) SUPPORTING INFORMATION.
(1) Claim Based on a Writing. Except for a claim governed by paragraph (3) of this subdivision,
when a claim, or an interest in property of the debtor securing the claim, is based on a writing, a
copy of the writing shall be filed with the proof of claim. If the writing has been lost or destroyed,
a statement of the circumstances of the loss or destruction shall be filed with the claim.
(2) Additional Requirements in an Individual Debtor Case; Sanctions for Failure to Comply. In
a case in which the debtor is an individual:
(A) If, in addition to its principal amount, a claim includes interest, fees, expenses, or other
charges incurred before the petition was filed, an itemized statement of the interest, fees,
expenses, or charges shall be filed with the proof of claim.
(B) If a security interest is claimed in the debtor's property, a statement of the amount
necessary to cure any default as of the date of the petition shall be filed with the proof of claim.
(C) If a security interest is claimed in property that is the debtor's principal residence, the
attachment prescribed by the appropriate Official Form shall be filed with the proof of claim. If
an escrow account has been established in connection with the claim, an escrow account
statement prepared as of the date the petition was filed and in a form consistent with applicable
nonbankruptcy law shall be filed with the attachment to the proof of claim.
(D) If the holder of a claim fails to provide any information required by this subdivision (c),
the court may, after notice and hearing, take either or both of the following actions:
(i) preclude the holder from presenting the omitted information, in any form, as evidence
in any contested matter or adversary proceeding in the case, unless the court determines that
the failure was substantially justified or is harmless; or
(ii) award other appropriate relief, including reasonable expenses and attorney's fees
caused by the failure.
(3) Claim Based on an Open-End or Revolving Consumer Credit Agreement.
(A) When a claim is based on an open-end or revolving consumer credit agreement—except
one for which a security interest is claimed in the debtor's real property—a statement shall be
filed with the proof of claim, including all of the following information that applies to the
account:
(i) the name of the entity from whom the creditor purchased the account;
(ii) the name of the entity to whom the debt was owed at the time of an account holder's
last transaction on the account;
(iii) the date of an account holder's last transaction;
(iv) the date of the last payment on the account; and
(v) the date on which the account was charged to profit and loss.
(B) On written request by a party in interest, the holder of a claim based on an open-end or
revolving consumer credit agreement shall, within 30 days after the request is sent, provide the
requesting party a copy of the writing specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision.
(d) EVIDENCE OF PERFECTION OF SECURITY INTEREST. If a security interest in property
of the debtor is claimed, the proof of claim shall be accompanied by evidence that the security
interest has been perfected.
(e) TRANSFERRED CLAIM.
[Release Point 118-106]
(1) Transfer of Claim Other Than for Security Before Proof Filed. If a claim has been
transferred other than for security before proof of the claim has been filed, the proof of claim may
be filed only by the transferee or an indenture trustee.
(2) Transfer of Claim Other than for Security after Proof Filed. If a claim other than one based
on a publicly traded note, bond, or debenture has been transferred other than for security after the
proof of claim has been filed, evidence of the transfer shall be filed by the transferee. The clerk
shall immediately notify the alleged transferor by mail of the filing of the evidence of transfer and
that objection thereto, if any, must be filed within 21 days of the mailing of the notice or within
any additional time allowed by the court. If the alleged transferor files a timely objection and the
court finds, after notice and a hearing, that the claim has been transferred other than for security, it
shall enter an order substituting the transferee for the transferor. If a timely objection is not filed
by the alleged transferor, the transferee shall be substituted for the transferor.
(3) Transfer of Claim for Security Before Proof Filed. If a claim other than one based on a
publicly traded note, bond, or debenture has been transferred for security before proof of the claim
has been filed, the transferor or transferee or both may file a proof of claim for the full amount.
The proof shall be supported by a statement setting forth the terms of the transfer. If either the
transferor or the transferee files a proof of claim, the clerk shall immediately notify the other by
mail of the right to join in the filed claim. If both transferor and transferee file proofs of the same
claim, the proofs shall be consolidated. If the transferor or transferee does not file an agreement
regarding its relative rights respecting voting of the claim, payment of dividends thereon, or
participation in the administration of the estate, on motion by a party in interest and after notice
and a hearing, the court shall enter such orders respecting these matters as may be appropriate.
(4) Transfer of Claim for Security after Proof Filed. If a claim other than one based on a
publicly traded note, bond, or debenture has been transferred for security after the proof of claim
has been filed, evidence of the terms of the transfer shall be filed by the transferee. The clerk shall
immediately notify the alleged transferor by mail of the filing of the evidence of transfer and that
objection thereto, if any, must be filed within 21 days of the mailing of the notice or within any
additional time allowed by the court. If a timely objection is filed by the alleged transferor, the
court, after notice and a hearing, shall determine whether the claim has been transferred for
security. If the transferor or transferee does not file an agreement regarding its relative rights
respecting voting of the claim, payment of dividends thereon, or participation in the administration
of the estate, on motion by a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court shall enter
such orders respecting these matters as may be appropriate.
(5) Service of Objection or Motion; Notice of Hearing. A copy of an objection filed pursuant to
paragraph (2) or (4) or a motion filed pursuant to paragraph (3) or (4) of this subdivision together
with a notice of a hearing shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to the transferor or transferee,
whichever is appropriate, at least 30 days prior to the hearing.
(f) EVIDENTIARY EFFECT. A proof of claim executed and filed in accordance with these rules
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim.
(g) 1 To the extent not inconsistent with the United States Warehouse Act or applicable State law,
a warehouse receipt, scale ticket, or similar document of the type routinely issued as evidence of title
by a grain storage facility, as defined in section 557 of title 11, shall constitute prima facie evidence
of the validity and amount of a claim of ownership of a quantity of grain.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rules 301 and 302. The Federal Rules of Evidence, made
applicable to cases under the Code by Rule 1101, do not prescribe the evidentiary effect to be accorded
particular documents. Subdivision (f) of this rule supplements the Federal Rules of Evidence as they apply to
cases under the Code.
Subdivision (c). This subdivision is similar to former Bankruptcy Rule 302(c) and continues the
[Release Point 118-106]
requirement for the filing of any written security agreement and provides that the filing of a duplicate of a
writing underlying a claim authenticates the claim with the same effect as the filing of the original writing. Cf.
Rules 1001(4) and 1003 of F.R. of Evid. Subdivision (d) together with the requirement in the first sentence of
subdivision (c) for the filing of any written security agreement, is designed to facilitate the determination
whether the claim is secured and properly perfected so as to be valid against the trustee.
Subdivision (d). "Satisfactory evidence" of perfection, which is to accompany the proof of claim, would
include a duplicate of an instrument filed or recorded, a duplicate of a certificate of title when a security
interest is perfected by notation on such a certificate, a statement that pledged property has been in possession
of the secured party since a specified date, or a statement of the reasons why no action was necessary for
perfection. The secured creditor may not be required to file a proof of claim under this rule if he is not seeking
allowance of a claim for a deficiency. But see §506(d) of the Code.
Subdivision (e). The rule recognizes the differences between an unconditional transfer of a claim and a
transfer for the purpose of security and prescribes a procedure for dealing with the rights of the transferor and
transferee when the transfer is for security. The rule clarifies the procedure to be followed when a transfer
precedes or follows the filing of the petition. The interests of sound administration are served by requiring the
post-petition transferee to file with the proof of claim a statement of the transferor acknowledging the transfer
and the consideration for the transfer. Such a disclosure will assist the court in dealing with evils that may
arise out of post-bankruptcy traffic in claims against an estate. Monroe v. Scofield, 135 F.2d 725 (10th Cir.
1943); In re Philadelphia & Western Ry., 64 F. Supp. 738 (E.D. Pa. 1946); cf. In re Latham Lithographic
Corp., 107 F.2d 749 (2d Cir. 1939). Both paragraphs (1) and (3) of this subdivision, which deal with a transfer
before the filing of a proof of claim, recognize that the transferee may be unable to obtain the required
statement from the transferor, but in that event a sound reason for such inability must accompany the proof of
claim filed by the transferee.
Paragraphs (3) and (4) clarify the status of a claim transferred for the purpose of security. An assignee for
security has been recognized as a rightful claimant in bankruptcy. Feder v. John Engelhorn & Sons, 202 F.2d
411 (2d Cir. 1953). An assignor's right to file a claim notwithstanding the assignment was sustained in In re R
& L Engineering Co., 182 F. Supp. 317 (S.D. Cal. 1960). Facilitation of the filing of proofs by both claimants
as holders of interests in a single claim is consonant with equitable treatment of the parties and sound
administration. See In re Latham Lithographic Corp., 107 F.2d 749 (2d Cir. 1939).
Paragraphs (2) and (4) of subdivision (e) deal with the transfer of a claim after proof has been filed.
Evidence of the terms of the transfer required to be disclosed to the court will facilitate the court's
determination of the appropriate order to be entered because of the transfer.
Paragraph (5) describes the procedure to be followed when an objection is made by the transferor to the
transferee's filed evidence of transfer.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987
Subdivision (g) was added by §354 of the 1984 amendments.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.
Subdivision (e) is amended to limit the court's role to the adjudication of disputes regarding transfers of
claims. If a claim has been transferred prior to the filing of a proof of claim, there is no need to state the
consideration for the transfer or to submit other evidence of the transfer. If a claim has been transferred other
than for security after a proof of claim has been filed, the transferee is substituted for the transferor in the
absence of a timely objection by the alleged transferor. In that event, the clerk should note the transfer without
the need for court approval. If a timely objection is filed, the court's role is to determine whether a transfer has
been made that is enforceable under nonbankruptcy law. This rule is not intended either to encourage or
discourage postpetition transfers of claims or to affect any remedies otherwise available under nonbankruptcy
law to a transferor or transferee such as for misrepresentation in connection with the transfer of a claim. "After
notice and a hearing" as used in subdivision (e) shall be construed in accordance with paragraph (5).
The words "with the clerk" in subdivision (e)(2) and (e)(4) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a)
and 9001(3).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
[Release Point 118-106]
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2011 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) is amended to prescribe with greater specificity the supporting information
required to accompany certain proofs of claim and, in cases in which the debtor is an individual, the
consequences of failing to provide the required information.
Existing subdivision (c) is redesignated as (c)(1).
Subdivision (c)(2) is added to require additional information to accompany proofs of claim filed in cases in
which the debtor is an individual. When the holder of a claim seeks to recover—in addition to the principal
amount of a debt—interest, fees, expenses, or other charges, the proof of claim must be accompanied by a
statement itemizing these additional amounts with sufficient specificity to make clear the basis for the claimed
amount.
If a claim is secured by a security interest in the property of the debtor and the debtor defaulted on the claim
prior to the filing of the petition, the proof of claim must be accompanied by a statement of the amount
required to cure the prepetition default.
If the claim is secured by a security interest in the debtor's principal residence, the proof of claim must be
accompanied by the attachment prescribed by the appropriate Official Form. In that attachment, the holder of
the claim must provide the information required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph (2). In
addition, if an escrow account has been established in connection with the claim, an escrow account statement
showing the account balance, and any amount owed, as of the date the petition was filed must be submitted in
accordance with subparagraph (C). The statement must be prepared in a form consistent with the requirements
of nonbankruptcy law. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. §2601 et seq. (Real Estate Settlement Procedure Act). Thus the
holder of the claim may provide the escrow account statement using the same form it uses outside of
bankruptcy for this purpose.
Subparagraph (D) of subdivision (c)(2) sets forth sanctions that the court may impose on a creditor in an
individual debtor case that fails to provide information required by subdivision (c). Failure to provide the
required information does not itself constitute a ground for disallowance of a claim. See §502(b) of the Code.
But when an objection to the allowance of a claim is made or other litigation arises concerning the status or
treatment of a claim, if the holder of that claim has not complied with the requirements of this subdivision, the
court may preclude it from presenting as evidence any of the omitted information, unless the failure to comply
with this subdivision was substantially justified or harmless. The court retains discretion to allow an
amendment to a proof of claim under appropriate circumstances or to impose a sanction different from or in
addition to the preclusion of the introduction of evidence.
Changes Made After Publication.
Subdivision (c)(1). The requirement that the last account statement sent to the debtor be filed with the proof
of claim was deleted.
Subdivision (c)(2). In subparagraph (C), a provision was added requiring the use of the appropriate Official
Form for the attachment filed by a holder of a claim secured by a security interest in a debtor's principal
residence.
In subdivision (c)(2)(D), the clause "the holder shall be precluded" was deleted, and the provision was
revised to state that "the court may, after notice and hearing, take either or both" of the specified actions.
Committee Note. In the discussion of subdivision (c)(2), the term "security interest" was added to the
sentence that discusses the required filing of a statement of the amount necessary to cure a prepetition default.
The discussion of subdivision (c)(2)(D) was expanded to clarify that failure to provide required
documentation, by itself, is not a ground for disallowance of a claim and that the court has several options in
responding to a creditor's failure to provide information required by subdivision (c).
Other changes. Stylistic changes were made to the rule and the Committee Note.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2012 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) is amended in several respects. The former requirement in paragraph (1) to
file an original or duplicate of a supporting document is amended to reflect the current practice of filing only
copies. The proof of claim form instructs claimants not to file the original of a document because it may be
destroyed by the clerk's office after scanning.
Subdivision (c) is further amended to add paragraph (3). Except with respect to claims secured by a security
interest in the debtor's real property (such as a home equity line of credit), paragraph (3) specifies information
that must be provided in support of a claim based on an open-end or revolving consumer credit agreement
[Release Point 118-106]
(such as an agreement underlying the issuance of a credit card). Because a claim of this type may have been
sold one or more times prior to the debtor's bankruptcy, the debtor may not recognize the name of the person
filing the proof of claim. Disclosure of the information required by paragraph (3) will assist the debtor in
associating the claim with a known account. It will also provide a basis for assessing the timeliness of the
claim. The date, if any, on which the account was charged to profit and loss ("charge-off" date) under
subparagraph (A)(v) should be determined in accordance with applicable standards for the classification and
account management of consumer credit. A proof of claim executed and filed in accordance with
subparagraph (A), as well as the applicable provisions of subdivisions (a), (b), (c)(2), and (e), constitutes
prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim under subdivision (f).
To the extent that paragraph (3) applies to a claim, paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) is not applicable. A
party in interest, however, may obtain the writing on which an open-end or revolving consumer credit claim is
based by requesting in writing that documentation from the holder of the claim. The holder of the claim must
provide the documentation within 30 days after the request is sent. The court, for cause, may extend or reduce
that time period under Rule 9006.
Changes Made After Publication.
Subdivision (c)(1). The requirement for the attachment of a writing on which a claim is based was changed
to require that a copy, rather than the original or a duplicate, of the writing be provided.
Subdivision (c)(3). An exception to subparagraph (A) was added for open-end or revolving consumer credit
agreements that are secured by the debtor's real property.
A time limit of 30 days for responding to a written request under subparagraph (B) was added.
Committee Note. A statement was added to clarify that if a proof of claim complies with subdivision
(c)(3)(A), as well as with subdivisions (a), (b), (c)(2), and (e), it constitutes prima facie evidence of the
validity and amount of the claim under subdivision (f).
Other changes. Stylistic changes were also made to the rule.

Rule 3002. Filing Proof of Claim or Interest
(a) NECESSITY FOR FILING. A secured creditor, unsecured creditor, or equity security holder
must file a proof of claim or interest for the claim or interest to be allowed, except as provided in
Rules 1019(3), 3003, 3004, and 3005. A lien that secures a claim against the debtor is not void due
only to the failure of any entity to file a proof of claim.
(b) PLACE OF FILING. A proof of claim or interest shall be filed in accordance with Rule 5005.
(c) TIME FOR FILING. In a voluntary chapter 7 case, chapter 12 case, or chapter 13 case, a proof
of claim is timely filed if it is filed not later than 70 days after the order for relief under that chapter
or the date of the order of conversion to a case under chapter 12 or chapter 13. In an involuntary
chapter 7 case, a proof of claim is timely filed if it is filed not later than 90 days after the order for
relief under that chapter is entered. But in all these cases, the following exceptions apply:
(1) A proof of claim filed by a governmental unit, other than for a claim resulting from a tax
return filed under §1308, is timely filed if it is filed not later than 180 days after the date of the
order for relief. A proof of claim filed by a governmental unit for a claim resulting from a tax
return filed under §1308 is timely filed if it is filed no later than 180 days after the date of the
order for relief or 60 days after the date of the filing of the tax return. The court may, for cause,
[Release Point 118-106]
enlarge the time for a governmental unit to file a proof of claim only upon motion of the
governmental unit made before expiration of the period for filing a timely proof of claim.
(2) In the interest of justice and if it will not unduly delay the administration of the case, the
court may extend the time for filing a proof of claim by an infant or incompetent person or the
representative of either.
(3) An unsecured claim which arises in favor of an entity or becomes allowable as a result of a
judgment may be filed within 30 days after the judgment becomes final if the judgment is for the
recovery of money or property from that entity or denies or avoids the entity's interest in property.
If the judgment imposes a liability which is not satisfied, or a duty which is not performed within
such period or such further time as the court may permit, the claim shall not be allowed.
(4) A claim arising from the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor
may be filed within such time as the court may direct.
(5) If notice of insufficient assets to pay a dividend was given to creditors under Rule 2002(e),
and subsequently the trustee notifies the court that payment of a dividend appears possible, the
clerk shall give at least 90 days' notice by mail to creditors of that fact and of the date by which
proofs of claim must be filed.
(6) On motion filed by a creditor before or after the expiration of the time to file a proof of
claim, the court may extend the time by not more than 60 days from the date of the order granting
the motion. The motion may be granted if the court finds that the notice was insufficient under the
circumstances to give the creditor a reasonable time to file a proof of claim.
(7) A proof of claim filed by the holder of a claim that is secured by a security interest in the
debtor's principal residence is timely filed if:
(A) the proof of claim, together with the attachments required by Rule 3001(c)(2)(C), is filed
not later than 70 days after the order for relief is entered; and
(B) any attachments required by Rule 3001(c)(1) and (d) are filed as a supplement to the
holder's claim not later than 120 days after the order for relief is entered.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a) of this rule is substantially a restatement of the general requirement that claims be proved
and filed. The exceptions refer to Rule 3003 providing for the filing of claims in chapter 9 and 11 cases, and to
Rules 3004 and 3005 authorizing claims to be filed by the debtor or trustee and the filing of a claim by a
contingent creditor of the debtor.
A secured claim need not be filed or allowed under §502 or §506(d) unless a party in interest has requested
a determination and allowance or disallowance under §502.
Subdivision (c) is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 302(e) but changes the time limits on the filing of
claims in chapter 7 and 13 cases from six months to 90 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors.
The special rule for early filing by a secured creditor in a chapter 13 case, in former Rule 13–302(e)(1) is not
continued.
Although the claim of a secured creditor may have arisen before the petition, a judgment avoiding the
security interest may not have been entered until after the time for filing claims has expired. Under Rule
3002(c)(3) the creditor who did not file a secured claim may nevertheless file an unsecured claim within the
time prescribed. A judgment does not become final for the purpose of starting the 30 day period provided for
by paragraph (3) until the time for appeal has expired or, if an appeal is taken, until the appeal has been
disposed of. In re Tapp, 61 F. Supp. 594 (W.D. Ky. 1945).
Paragraph (1) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 302(e). The governmental unit may move for an
extension of the 90 day period. Pursuant to §501(c) of the Code, if the government does not file its claim
within the proper time period, the debtor or trustee may file on its behalf. An extension is not needed by the
debtor or trustee because the right to file does not arise until the government's time has expired.
Paragraph (4) is derived from former chapter rules. (See, e.g., Rule 11–33(a)(2)(B). In light of the reduced
time it is necessary that a party with a claim arising from the rejection of an executory contract have sufficient
time to file that claim. This clause allows the court to fix an appropriate time.
Paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) is correlated with the provision in Rule 2002(e) authorizing notification to
[Release Point 118-106]
creditors of estates from which no dividends are anticipated. The clause permits creditors who have refrained
from filing claims after receiving notification to be given an opportunity to file when subsequent
developments indicate the possibility of a dividend. The notice required by this clause must be given in the
manner provided in Rule 2002. The information relating to the discovery of assets will usually be obtained by
the clerk from the trustee's interim reports or special notification by the trustee.
Provision is made in Rule 2002(a) and (h) for notifying all creditors of the fixing of a time for filing claims
against a surplus under paragraph (6). This paragraph does not deal with the distribution of the surplus.
Reference must also be made to §726(a)(2)(C) and (3) which permits distribution on late filed claims.
Paragraph (6) is only operative in a chapter 7 case. In chapter 13 cases, the plan itself provides the
distribution to creditors which is not necessarily dependent on the size of the estate.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended by adding a reference to Rule 1019(4). Rule 1019(4) provides that claims
actually filed by a creditor in a chapter 11 or 13 case shall be treated as filed in a superseding chapter 7 case.
Claims deemed filed in a chapter 11 case pursuant to §1111(a) of the Code are not considered as filed in a
superseding chapter 7 case. The creditor must file a claim in the superseding chapter 7 case.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to conform to the renumbering of subdivisions of Rule 1019. Subdivision (c) is
amended to include chapter 12 cases. Subdivision (c)(4) is amended to clarify that it includes a claim arising
from the rejection of an unexpired lease.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1996 AMENDMENT
The amendments are designed to conform to §§502(b)(9) and 726(a) of the Code as amended by the
Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994.
The Reform Act amended §726(a)(1) and added §502(b)(9) to the Code to govern the effects of a tardily
filed claim. Under §502(b)(9), a tardily filed claim must be disallowed if an objection to the proof of claim is
filed, except to the extent that a holder of a tardily filed claim is entitled to distribution under §726(a)(1), (2),
or (3).
The phrase "in accordance with this rule" is deleted from Rule 3002(a) to clarify that the effect of filing a
proof of claim after the expiration of the time prescribed in Rule 3002(c) is governed by §502(b)(9) of the
Code, rather than by this rule.
Section 502(b)(9) of the Code provides that a claim of a governmental unit shall be timely filed if it is filed
"before 180 days after the date of the order for relief" or such later time as the Bankruptcy Rules provide. To
avoid any confusion as to whether a governmental unit's proof of claim is timely filed under §502(b)(9) if it is
filed on the 180th day after the order for relief, paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) provides that a governmental
unit's claim is timely if it is filed not later than 180 days after the order for relief.
References to "the United States, a state, or subdivision thereof" in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) are
changed to "governmental unit" to avoid different treatment among foreign and domestic governments.
GAP Report on Rule 3002. After publication of the proposed amendments, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of
1994 amended sections 726 and 502(b) of the Code to clarify the rights of creditors who tardily file a proof of
claim. In view of the Reform Act, proposed new subdivision (d) of Rule 3002 has been deleted from the
proposed amendments because it is no longer necessary. In addition, subdivisions (a) and (c) have been
changed after publication to clarify that the effect of tardily filing a proof of claim is governed by §502(b)(9)
of the Code, rather than by this rule.
The amendments to §502(b) also provide that a governmental unit's proof of claim is timely filed if it is
filed before 180 days after the order for relief. Proposed amendments to Rule 3002(c)(1) were added to the
published amendments to conform to this statutory change and to avoid any confusion as to whether a claim
by a governmental unit is timely if it is filed on the 180th day.
The committee note has been re-written to explain the rule changes designed to conform to the Reform Act.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c)(1) is amended to reflect the addition of §1308 to the Bankruptcy Code in 2005. This
provision requires that chapter 13 debtors file tax returns during the pendency of the case, and imposes
bankruptcy-related consequences if debtors fail to do so. Subdivision (c)(1) provides additional time for
governmental units to file a proof of claim for tax obligations with respect to tax returns filed during the
pendency of a chapter 13 case. The amendment also allows the governmental unit to move for additional time
to file a proof of claim prior to expiration of the applicable filing period.
Subdivision (c)(5) of the rule is amended to set a new period for providing notice to creditors that they may
[Release Point 118-106]
file a proof of claim in a case in which they were previously informed that there was no need to file a claim.
Under Rule 2002(e), if it appears that there will be no distribution to creditors, the creditors are notified of this
fact and are informed that if assets are later discovered and a distribution is likely that a new notice will be
given to the creditors. This second notice is prescribed by Rule 3002(c)(5). The rule is amended to direct the
clerk to give at least 90 days' notice of the time within which creditors may file a proof of claim. Setting the
deadline in this manner allows the notices being sent to creditors to be more accurate regarding the deadline
than was possible under the prior rule. The rule previously began the 90 day notice period from the time of the
mailing of the notice, a date that could vary and generally would not even be known to the creditor. Under the
amended rule, the notice will identify a specific bar date for filing proofs of claim thereby being more helpful
to the creditors.
Subdivision (c)(6) is added to give the court discretion to extend the time for filing a proof of claim for a
creditor who received notice of the time to file the claim at a foreign address, if the court finds that the notice
was not sufficient, under the particular circumstances, to give the foreign creditor a reasonable time to file a
proof of claim. This amendment is designed to comply with §1514(d), added to the Code by the 2005
amendments, and requires that the rules and orders of the court provide such additional time as is reasonable
under the circumstances for foreign creditors to file claims in cases under all chapters of the Code.
Other changes are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication. Subdivision (c)(1) was amended to allow governmental units to move for
an enlargement of the time to file a proof of claim. The Committee Note was amended to describe this
addition to the rule.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2017 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to clarify that a creditor, including a secured creditor, must file a proof of claim
in order to have an allowed claim. The amendment also clarifies, in accordance with §506(d), that the failure
of a secured creditor to file a proof of claim does not render the creditor's lien void. The inclusion of language
from §506(d) is not intended to effect any change of law with respect to claims subject to setoff under §553.
The amendment preserves the existing exceptions to this rule under Rules 1019(3), 3003, 3004, and 3005.
Under Rule 1019(3), a creditor does not need to file another proof of claim after conversion of a case to
chapter 7. Rule 3003 governs the filing of a proof of claim in chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. Rules 3004 and
3005 govern the filing of a proof of claim by the debtor, trustee, or another entity if a creditor does not do so
in a timely manner.
Subdivision (c) is amended to alter the calculation of the bar date for proofs of claim in chapter 7, chapter
12, and chapter 13 cases. The amendment changes the time for filing a proof of claim in a voluntary chapter 7
case, a chapter 12 case, or a chapter 13 case from 90 days after the §341 meeting of creditors to 70 days after
the petition date. If a case is converted to chapter 12 or chapter 13, the 70-day time for filing runs from the
order of conversion. If a case is converted to chapter 7, Rule 1019(2) provides that a new time period for filing
a claim commences under Rule 3002. In an involuntary chapter 7 case, a 90-day time for filing applies and
runs from the entry of the order for relief.
Subdivision (c)(6) is amended to expand the exception to the bar date for cases in which a creditor received
insufficient notice of the time to file a proof of claim. The amendment provides that the court may extend the
time to file a proof of claim if the debtor fails to file a timely list of names and addresses of creditors as
required by Rule 1007(a). The amendment also clarifies that if a court grants a creditor's motion under this
rule to extend the time to file a proof of claim, the extension runs from the date of the court's decision on the
motion.
Subdivision (c)(7) is added to provide a two-stage deadline for filing mortgage proofs of claim secured by
an interest in the debtor's principal residence. Those proofs of claim must be filed with the appropriate Official
Form mortgage attachment within 70 days of the order for relief. The claim will be timely if any additional
documents evidencing the claim, as required by Rule 3001(c)(1) and (d), are filed within 120 days of the order
for relief. The order for relief is the commencement of the case upon filing a petition, except in an involuntary
case. See §301 and §303(h). The confirmation of a plan within the 120-day period set forth in subdivision
(c)(7)(B) does not prohibit an objection to any proof of claim.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
Rule 3002(c)(6) is amended to provide a single standard for granting motions for an extension of time to
file a proof of claim, whether the creditor has a domestic address or a foreign address. If the notice to such
creditor was "insufficient under the circumstances to give the creditor a reasonable time to file a proof of
claim," the court may grant an extension.
[Release Point 118-106]
Rule 3002.1. Notice Relating to Claims Secured by Security Interest in the
Debtor's Principal Residence
(a) IN GENERAL. This rule applies in a chapter 13 case to claims (1) that are secured by a
security interest in the debtor's principal residence, and (2) for which the plan provides that either the
trustee or the debtor will make contractual installment payments. Unless the court orders otherwise,
the notice requirements of this rule cease to apply when an order terminating or annulling the
automatic stay becomes effective with respect to the residence that secures the claim.
(b) NOTICE OF PAYMENT CHANGES; OBJECTION.
(1) Notice. The holder of the claim shall file and serve on the debtor, debtor's counsel, and the
trustee a notice of any change in the payment amount, including any change that results from an
interest-rate or escrow-account adjustment, no later than 21 days before a payment in the new
amount is due. If the claim arises from a home-equity line of credit, this requirement may be
modified by court order.
(2) Objection. A party in interest who objects to the payment change may file a motion to
determine whether the change is required to maintain payments in accordance with §1322(b)(5) of
the Code. If no motion is filed by the day before the new amount is due, the change goes into
effect, unless the court orders otherwise.
(c) NOTICE OF FEES, EXPENSES, AND CHARGES. The holder of the claim shall file and
serve on the debtor, debtor's counsel, and the trustee a notice itemizing all fees, expenses, or charges
(1) that were incurred in connection with the claim after the bankruptcy case was filed, and (2) that
the holder asserts are recoverable against the debtor or against the debtor's principal residence. The
notice shall be served within 180 days after the date on which the fees, expenses, or charges are
incurred.
(d) FORM AND CONTENT. A notice filed and served under subdivision (b) or (c) of this rule
shall be prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form, and filed as a supplement to the
holder's proof of claim. The notice is not subject to Rule 3001(f).
(e) DETERMINATION OF FEES, EXPENSES, OR CHARGES. On motion of a party in interest
filed within one year after service of a notice under subdivision (c) of this rule, the court shall, after
notice and hearing, determine whether payment of any claimed fee, expense, or charge is required by
the underlying agreement and applicable nonbankruptcy law to cure a default or maintain payments
in accordance with §1322(b)(5) of the Code.
(f) NOTICE OF FINAL CURE PAYMENT. Within 30 days after the debtor completes all
payments under the plan, the trustee shall file and serve on the holder of the claim, the debtor, and
debtor's counsel a notice stating that the debtor has paid in full the amount required to cure any
default on the claim. The notice shall also inform the holder of its obligation to file and serve a
response under subdivision (g). If the debtor contends that final cure payment has been made and all
plan payments have been completed, and the trustee does not timely file and serve the notice
required by this subdivision, the debtor may file and serve the notice.
(g) RESPONSE TO NOTICE OF FINAL CURE PAYMENT. Within 21 days after service of the
notice under subdivision (f) of this rule, the holder shall file and serve on the debtor, debtor's
counsel, and the trustee a statement indicating (1) whether it agrees that the debtor has paid in full
the amount required to cure the default on the claim, and (2) whether the debtor is otherwise current
on all payments consistent with §1322(b)(5) of the Code. The statement shall itemize the required
cure or postpetition amounts, if any, that the holder contends remain unpaid as of the date of the
statement. The statement shall be filed as a supplement to the holder's proof of claim and is not
subject to Rule 3001(f).
(h) DETERMINATION OF FINAL CURE AND PAYMENT. On motion of the debtor or trustee
filed within 21 days after service of the statement under subdivision (g) of this rule, the court shall,
after notice and hearing, determine whether the debtor has cured the default and paid all required
postpetition amounts.
(i) FAILURE TO NOTIFY. If the holder of a claim fails to provide any information as required by
[Release Point 118-106]
subdivision (b), (c), or (g) of this rule, the court may, after notice and hearing, take either or both of
the following actions:
(1) preclude the holder from presenting the omitted information, in any form, as evidence in any
contested matter or adversary proceeding in the case, unless the court determines that the failure
was substantially justified or is harmless; or
(2) award other appropriate relief, including reasonable expenses and attorney's fees caused by
the failure.
(Added Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011; amended Apr. 28, 2016, eff. Dec. 1, 2016; Apr. 26, 2018,

COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2011
This rule is new. It is added to aid in the implementation of §1322(b)(5), which permits a chapter 13 debtor
to cure a default and maintain payments on a home mortgage over the course of the debtor's plan. It applies
regardless of whether the trustee or the debtor is the disbursing agent for postpetition mortgage payments.
In order to be able to fulfill the obligations of §l322(b)(5), a debtor and the trustee have to be informed of
the exact amount needed to cure any prepetition arrearage, see Rule 3001(c)(2), and the amount of the
postpetition payment obligations. If the latter amount changes over time, due to the adjustment of the interest
rate, escrow account adjustments, or the assessment of fees, expenses, or other charges, notice of any change
in payment amount needs to be conveyed to the debtor and trustee. Timely notice of these changes will permit
the debtor or trustee to challenge the validity of any such charges, if appropriate, and to adjust postpetition
mortgage payments to cover any undisputed claimed adjustment. Compliance with the notice provision of the
rule should also eliminate any concern on the part of the holder of the claim that informing a debtor of a
change in postpetition payment obligations might violate the automatic stay.
Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) specifies that this rule applies only in a chapter 13 case to claims secured
by a security interest in the debtor's principal residence.
Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) requires the holder of a claim to notify the debtor, debtor's counsel, and the
trustee of any postpetition change in the mortgage payment amount at least 21 days before the new payment
amount is due.
Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) requires an itemized notice to be given, within 180 days of incurrence, of
any postpetition fees, expenses, or charges that the holder of the claim asserts are recoverable from the debtor
or against the debtor's principal residence. This might include, for example, inspection fees, late charges, or
attorney's fees.
Subdivision (d). Subdivision (d) provides the method of giving the notice under subdivisions (b) and (c). In
both instances, the holder of the claim must give notice of the change as prescribed by the appropriate Official
Form. In addition to serving the debtor, debtor's counsel, and the trustee, the holder of the claim must also file
the notice on the claims register in the case as a supplement to its proof of claim. Rule 3001(f) does not apply
to any notice given under subdivision (b) or (c), and therefore the notice will not constitute prima facie
evidence of the validity and amount of the payment change or of the fee, expense, or charge.
Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) permits the debtor or trustee, within a year after service of a notice under
subdivision (c), to seek a determination by the court as to whether the fees, expenses, or charges set forth in
the notice are required by the underlying agreement or applicable nonbankruptcy law to cure a default or
maintain payments.
Subdivision (f). Subdivision (f) requires the trustee to issue a notice to the holder of the claim, the debtor,
and the debtor's attorney within 30 days after completion of payments under the plan. The notice must (1)
indicate that all amounts required to cure a default on a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence have
been paid, and (2) direct the holder to comply with subdivision (g). If the trustee fails to file this notice within
the required time, this subdivision also permits the debtor to file and serve the notice on the trustee and the
holder of the claim.
Subdivision (g). Subdivision (g) governs the response of the holder of the claim to the trustee's or debtor's
notice under subdivision (f). Within 21 days after service of notice of the final cure payment, the holder of the
claim must file and serve a statement indicating whether the prepetition default has been fully cured and also
whether the debtor is current on all payments in accordance with §1322(b)(5) of the Code. If the holder of the
claim contends that all cure payments have not been made or that the debtor is not current on other payments
required by §1322(b)(5), the response must itemize all amounts, other than regular future installment
payments, that the holder contends are due.
Subdivision (h). Subdivision (h) provides a procedure for the judicial resolution of any disputes that may
arise about payment of a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence. Within 21 days after the service of
[Release Point 118-106]
the statement under (g), the trustee or debtor may move for a determination by the court of whether any
default has been cured and whether any other non-current obligations remain outstanding.
Subdivision (i). Subdivision (i) specifies sanctions that may be imposed if the holder of a claim fails to
provide any of the information as required by subdivisions (b), (c), or (g).
If, after the chapter 13 debtor has completed payments under the plan and the case has been closed, the
holder of a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence seeks to recover amounts that should have been
but were not disclosed under this rule, the debtor may move to have the case reopened in order to seek
sanctions against the holder of the claim under subdivision (i).
Changes Made After Publication.
Subdivision (a). As part of organizational changes intended to make the rule shorter and clearer, a new
subdivision (a) was inserted that specifies the applicability of the rule. Other subdivision designations were
changed accordingly.
Subdivision (b). The timing of the notice of payment change, addressed in subdivision (a) of the published
rule, was changed from 30 to 21 days before payment must be made in the new amount.
Subdivision (d). The provisions of the published rule prescribing the procedure for providing notice of
payment changes and of fees, expenses, and charges were moved to subdivision (d).
Subdivision (e). As part of the organizational revision of the rule, the provision governing the resolution of
disputes over claimed fees, expenses, or charges was moved to this subdivision.
Subdivision (f). The triggering event for the filing of the notice of final cure payment was changed to the
debtor's completion of all payments required under the plan. A sentence was added requiring the notice to
inform the holder of the mortgage claim of its obligation to file and serve a response under subdivision (g).
Subdivision (h). The caption of this subdivision (which was subdivision (f) as published), was changed to
describe its content more precisely.
Subdivision (i). The clause "the holder shall be precluded" was deleted, and the provision was revised to
state that "the court may, after notice and hearing, take either or both" of the specified actions.
Committee Note. A sentence was added to the first paragraph to clarify that the rule applies regardless of
whether ongoing mortgage payments are made directly by the debtor or disbursed through the chapter 13
trustee. Other changes were made to the Committee Note to reflect the changes made to the rule.
Other changes. Stylistic changes were made throughout the rule and Committee Note.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2016 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to clarify the applicability of the rule. Its provisions apply whenever a chapter
13 plan provides that contractual payments on the debtor's home mortgage will be maintained, whether they
will be paid by the trustee or directly by the debtor. The reference to §1322(b)(5) of the Code is deleted to
make clear that the rule applies even if there is no prepetition arrearage to be cured. So long as a creditor has a
claim that is secured by a security interest in the debtor's principal residence and the plan provides that
contractual payments on the claim will be maintained, the rule applies.
Subdivision (a) is further amended to provide that, unless the court orders otherwise, the notice obligations
imposed by this rule cease on the effective date of an order granting relief from the automatic stay with regard
to the debtor's principal residence. Debtors and trustees typically do not make payments on mortgages after
the stay relief is granted, so there is generally no need for the holder of the claim to continue providing the
notices required by this rule. Sometimes, however, there may be reasons for the debtor to continue receiving
mortgage information after stay relief. For example, the debtor may intend to seek a mortgage modification or
to cure the default. When the court determines that the debtor has a need for the information required by this
rule, the court is authorized to order that the notice obligations remain in effect or be reinstated after the relief
from the stay is granted.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is subdivided and amended in two respects. First, it is amended in what is now subdivision
(b)(1) to authorize courts to modify its requirements for claims arising from home equity lines of credit
(HELOCs). Because payments on HELOCs may adjust frequently and in small amounts, the rule provides
flexibility for courts to specify alternative procedures for keeping the person who is maintaining payments on
the loan apprised of the current payment amount. Courts may specify alternative requirements for providing
notice of changes in HELOC payment amounts by local rules or orders in individual cases.
Second, what is now subdivision (b)(2) is amended to acknowledge the right of the trustee, debtor, or other
party in interest, such as the United States trustee, to object to a change in a home-mortgage payment amount
after receiving notice of the change under subdivision (b)(1). The amended rule does not set a deadline for
filing a motion for a determination of the validity of the payment change, but it provides as a general
matter—subject to a contrary court order—that if no motion has been filed on or before the day before the
[Release Point 118-106]
change is to take effect, the announced change goes into effect. If there is a later motion and a determination
that the payment change was not required to maintain payments under §1322(b)(5), appropriate adjustments
will have to be made to reflect any overpayments. If, however, a motion is made during the time specified in
subdivision (b)(2), leading to a suspension of the payment change, a determination that the payment change
was valid will require the debtor to cure the resulting default in order to be current on the mortgage at the end
of the bankruptcy case.
Subdivision (e) is amended to allow parties in interest in addition to the debtor or trustee, such as the United
States trustee, to seek a determination regarding the validity of any claimed fee, expense, or charge.
Rule 3003. Filing Proof of Claim or Equity Security Interest in Chapter 9
Municipality or Chapter 11 Reorganization Cases
(a) APPLICABILITY OF RULE. This rule applies in chapter 9 and 11 cases.
(b) SCHEDULE OF LIABILITIES AND LIST OF EQUITY SECURITY HOLDERS.
(1) Schedule of Liabilities. The schedule of liabilities filed pursuant to §521(l) of the Code shall
constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claims of creditors, unless they
are scheduled as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated. It shall not be necessary for a creditor or
equity security holder to file a proof of claim or interest except as provided in subdivision (c)(2) of
this rule.
(2) List of Equity Security Holders. The list of equity security holders filed pursuant to Rule
1007(a)(3) shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the equity security
interests and it shall not be necessary for the holders of such interests to file a proof of interest.
(c) FILING PROOF OF CLAIM.
(1) Who May File. Any creditor or indenture trustee may file a proof of claim within the time
prescribed by subdivision (c)(3) of this rule.
(2) Who Must File. Any creditor or equity security holder whose claim or interest is not
scheduled or scheduled as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated shall file a proof of claim or
interest within the time prescribed by subdivision (c)(3) of this rule; any creditor who fails to do so
shall not be treated as a creditor with respect to such claim for the purposes of voting and
distribution.
(3) Time for Filing. The court shall fix and for cause shown may extend the time within which
proofs of claim or interest may be filed. Notwithstanding the expiration of such time, a proof of
claim may be filed to the extent and under the conditions stated in Rule 3002(c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(4),
and (c)(6).
(4) Effect of Filing Claim or Interest. A proof of claim or interest executed and filed in
accordance with this subdivision shall supersede any scheduling of that claim or interest pursuant
to §521(a)(1) of the Code.
(5) Filing by Indenture Trustee. An indenture trustee may file a claim on behalf of all known or
unknown holders of securities issued pursuant to the trust instrument under which it is trustee.
(d) PROOF OF RIGHT TO RECORD STATUS. For the purposes of Rules 3017, 3018 and 3021
and for receiving notices, an entity who is not the record holder of a security may file a statement
setting forth facts which entitle that entity to be treated as the record holder. An objection to the
statement may be filed by any party in interest.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 23, 2008, eff.
Dec. 1, 2008.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a). This rule applies only in chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. It is adapted from former Chapter
X Rule 10–401 and provides an exception to the requirement for filing proofs of claim and interest as
expressed in §§925 and 1111(a) of the Code.
Subdivision (b). This general statement implements §§925 and 1111(a) of the Code.
Subdivision (c). This subdivision permits, in paragraph (1), the filing of a proof of claim but does not make
[Release Point 118-106]
it mandatory. Paragraph (2) requires, as does the Code, filing when a claim is scheduled as disputed,
contingent, or unliquidated as to amount. It is the creditor's responsibility to determine if the claim is
accurately listed. Notice of the provision of this rule is provided for in Official Form No. 16, the order for the
meeting of creditors. In an appropriate case the court may order creditors whose claims are scheduled as
disputed, contingent, or unliquidated be notified of that fact but the procedure is left to the discretion of the
court.
Subdivision (d) is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10–401(f).
Except with respect to the need and time for filing claims, the other aspects concerning claims covered by
Rules 3001 and 3002 are applicable in chapter 9 and 11 cases.
Holders of equity security interests need not file proofs of interest. Voting and distribution participation is
dependent on ownership as disclosed by the appropriate records of a transfer agent or the corporate or other
business records at the time prescribed in Rules 3017 and 3021.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) is amended to permit the late filing of claims by infants or incompetent
persons under the same circumstances that permit late filings in cases under chapter 7, 12, or 13. The
amendment also provides sufficient time in which to file a claim that arises from a postpetition judgment
against the claimant for the recovery of money or property or the avoidance of a lien. It also provides for
purposes of clarification that upon rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease, the court shall set a
time for filing a claim arising therefrom despite prior expiration of the time set for filing proofs of claim.
The caption of paragraph (4) of subdivision (c) is amended to indicate that it applies to a proof of claim.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c)(3) is amended to implement §1514(d) of the Code, which was added by the 2005
amendments. It makes the new Rule 3002(c)(6) applicable in chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. This change was
necessary so that creditors with foreign addresses be provided such additional time as is reasonable under the
circumstances to file proofs of claims.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
Rule 3004. Filing of Claims by Debtor or Trustee
If a creditor does not timely file a proof of claim under Rule 3002(c) or 3003(c), the debtor or
trustee may file a proof of the claim within 30 days after the expiration of the time for filing claims
prescribed by Rule 3002(c) or 3003(c), whichever is applicable. The clerk shall forthwith give notice
of the filing to the creditor, the debtor and the trustee.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 25, 2005, eff. Dec. 1, 2005.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 303 but conforms with the changes made by §501(c) of
the Code. Rule 303 permitted only the filing of tax and wage claims by the debtor. Section 501(c) of the Code,
however, permits the filing by the debtor or trustee on behalf of any creditor.
It is the policy of the Code that debtors' estates should be administered for the benefit of creditors without
regard to the dischargeability of their claims. After their estates have been closed, however, discharged
debtors may find themselves saddled with liabilities, particularly for taxes, which remain unpaid because of
the failure of creditors holding nondischargeable claims to file proofs of claim and receive distributions
thereon. The result is that the debtor is deprived of an important benefit of the Code without any fault or
omission on the debtor's part and without any objective of the Code being served thereby.
Section 501(c) of the Code authorizes a debtor or trustee to file a proof of claim for any holder of a claim.
Although all claims may not be nondischargeable, it may be difficult to determine, in particular, whether tax
claims survive discharge. See Plumb, Federal Tax Liens and Priorities in Bankruptcy, 43 Ref. J. 37, 43–44
(1969); 1 Collier, Bankruptcy 17.14 (14th ed. 1967); 3 id. 523.06 (15th ed. 1979). To eliminate the necessity
of the resolution of this troublesome issue, the option accorded the debtor by the Code does not depend on the
nondischargeability of the claim. No serious administrative problems and no unfairness to creditors seemed to
develop from adoption of Rule 303, the forerunner to §501(c). The authority to file is conditioned on the
creditor's failure to file the proof of claim on or before the first date set for the meeting of creditors, which is
the date a claim must ordinarily be filed in order to be voted in a chapter 7 case. Notice to the creditor is
provided to enable him to file a proof of claim pursuant to Rule 3002, which proof, when filed, would
[Release Point 118-106]
supersede the proof filed by the debtor or trustee. Notice to the trustee would serve to alert the trustee to the
special character of the proof and the possible need for supplementary evidence of the validity and amount of
the claim. If the trustee does not qualify until after a proof of claim is filed by the debtor pursuant to this rule,
he should be notified as soon as practicable thereafter.
To the extent the claim is allowed and dividends paid thereon, it will be reduced or perhaps paid in full. If
the claim is also filed pursuant to Rule 3005, only one distribution thereon may be made. As expressly
required by Rule 3005 and by the purpose of this rule such distribution must diminish the claim.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Under the rule as amended, the debtor or trustee in a chapter 7 or 13 case has 120 days from the first date
set for the meeting of creditors to file a claim for the creditor. During the first 90 days of that period the
creditor in a chapter 7 or 13 case may file a claim as provided by Rule 3002(c). If the creditor fails to file a
claim, the debtor or trustee shall have an additional 30 days thereafter to file the claim. A proof of claim filed
by a creditor supersedes a claim filed by the debtor or trustee only if it is timely filed within the 90 days
allowed under Rule 3002(c).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2005 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to conform to §501(c) of the Code. Under that provision, the debtor or trustee may file
proof of a claim if the creditor fails to do so in a timely fashion. The rule previously authorized the debtor and
the trustee to file a claim as early as the day after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under §341(a).
Under the amended rule, the debtor and trustee must wait until the creditor's opportunity to file a claim has
expired. Providing the debtor and the trustee with the opportunity to file a claim ensures that the claim will
participate in any distribution in the case. This is particularly important for claims that are nondischargeable.
Since the debtor and trustee cannot file a proof of claim until after the creditor's time to file has expired, the
rule no longer permits the creditor to file a proof of claim that will supersede the claim filed by the debtor or
trustee. The rule leaves to the courts the issue of whether to permit subsequent amendment of such proof of
claim.
Other changes are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication. The Advisory
Committee concluded that Mr. Van Allsburg's suggestion goes beyond the scope of the published proposal.
Consequently, the Committee declined to adopt the suggestion but may consider it in greater detail at a future
meeting.
Rule 3005. Filing of Claim, Acceptance, or Rejection by Guarantor, Surety,
Indorser, or Other Codebtor
(a) FILING OF CLAIM. If a creditor does not timely file a proof of claim under Rule 3002(c) or
3003(c), any entity that is or may be liable with the debtor to that creditor, or who has secured that
creditor, may file a proof of the claim within 30 days after the expiration of the time for filing claims
prescribed by Rule 3002(c) or Rule 3003(c) whichever is applicable. No distribution shall be made
on the claim except on satisfactory proof that the original debt will be diminished by the amount of
distribution.
(b) FILING OF ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION; SUBSTITUTION OF CREDITOR. An entity
which has filed a claim pursuant to the first sentence of subdivision (a) of this rule may file an
acceptance or rejection of a plan in the name of the creditor, if known, or if unknown, in the entity's
own name but if the creditor files a proof of claim within the time permitted by Rule 3003(c) or files
a notice prior to confirmation of a plan of the creditor's intention to act in the creditor's own behalf,
the creditor shall be substituted for the obligor with respect to that claim.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 25, 2005, eff.
Dec. 1, 2005.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is adapted from former Rules 304 and 10–402. Together with §501(b) of the Code, the rule makes
clear that anyone who may be liable on a debt of the debtor, including a surety, guarantor, indorser, or other
codebtor, is authorized to file in the name of the creditor of the debtor.
Subdivision (a). Rule 3002(c) provides the time period for filing proofs of claim in chapter 7 and 13 cases;
[Release Point 118-106]
Rule 3003(c) provides the time, when necessary, for filing claims in a chapter 9 or 11 case.
Subdivision (b). This subdivision applies in chapter 9 and 11 cases as distinguished from chapter 7 cases. It
permits voting for or against a plan by an obligor who files a claim in place of the creditor.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The words "with the court" in subdivision (b) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2005 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to delete the last sentence of subdivision (a). The sentence is unnecessary because if a
creditor has filed a timely claim under Rule 3002 or 3003(c), the codebtor cannot file a proof of such claim.
The codebtor, consistent with §501(b) of the Code, may file a proof of such claim only after the creditor's time
to file has expired. Therefore, the rule no longer permits the creditor to file a superseding claim. The rule
leaves to the courts the issue of whether to permit subsequent amendment of the proof of claim.
The amendment conforms the rule to §501(b) by deleting language providing that the codebtor files proof
of the claim in the name of the creditor.
Other amendments are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment:
(a) The reference on line 2 of Rule 3005 to "Rule 3002 or 3003(c)" was changed to read "Rule 3002(c) or
3003(c)" to make it parallel to the language in Rule 3004.
(b) The phrase "file a proof of the claim" from line 7 of the proposed rule was moved up to line 4 of the
proposed amendment immediately after the word "may". This makes the structure of Rules 3004 and 3005
more consistent.
Rule 3006. Withdrawal of Claim; Effect on Acceptance or Rejection of Plan
A creditor may withdraw a claim as of right by filing a notice of withdrawal, except as provided in
this rule. If after a creditor has filed a proof of claim an objection is filed thereto or a complaint is
filed against that creditor in an adversary proceeding, or the creditor has accepted or rejected the plan
or otherwise has participated significantly in the case, the creditor may not withdraw the claim
except on order of the court after a hearing on notice to the trustee or debtor in possession, and any
creditors' committee elected pursuant to §705(a) or appointed pursuant to §1102 of the Code. The
order of the court shall contain such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. Unless the court
orders otherwise, an authorized withdrawal of a claim shall constitute withdrawal of any related
acceptance or rejection of a plan.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Rules 305 and 10–404.
Since 1938 it has generally been held that Rule 41 F.R.Civ.P. governs the withdrawal of a proof of claim. In
re Empire Coal Sales Corp., 45 F. Supp. 974, 976 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd sub nom. Kleid v. Ruthbell Coal Co., 131
F.2d 372, 373 (2d Cir. 1942); Kelso v. MacLaren, 122 F.2d 867, 870 (8th Cir. 1941); In re Hills, 35 F. Supp.
532, 533 (W.D. Wash. 1940). Accordingly, the cited cases held that after an objection has been filed a proof
of claim may be withdrawn only subject to approval by the court. This constitutes a restriction of the right of
withdrawal as recognized by some though by no means all of the cases antedating the promulgation of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See 3 Collier Bankruptcy, 57.12 (14th ed. 1961); Note, 20 Bost. U. L. Rev.
121 (1940).
The filing of a claim does not commence an adversary proceeding but the filing of an objection to the claim
initiates a contest that must be disposed of by the court. This rule recognizes the applicability of the
considerations underlying Rule 41(a) F.R.Civ.P. to the withdrawal of a claim after it has been put in issue by
an objection. Rule 41(a)(2) F.R.Civ.P. requires leave of court to obtain dismissal over the objection of a
defendant who has pleaded a counterclaim prior to the service of the plaintiff's motion to dismiss. Although
the applicability of this provision to the withdrawal of a claim was assumed in Conway v. Union Bank of
Switzerland, 204 F.2d 603, 608 (2d Cir. 1953), Kleid v. Ruthbell Coal Co., supra, Kelso v. MacLaren, supra,
and In re Hills, supra, this rule vests discretion in the court to grant, deny, or condition the request of a
creditor to withdraw, without regard to whether the trustee has filed a merely defensive objection or a
complaint seeking an affirmative recovery of money or property from the creditor.
A number of pre-1938 cases sustained denial of a creditor's request to withdraw proof of claim on the
[Release Point 118-106]
ground of estoppel or election of remedies. 2 Remington, Bankruptcy 186 (Henderson ed. 1956); cf. 3 Collier,
supra 57.12, at 201 (1964). Voting a claim for a trustee was an important factor in the denial of a request to
withdraw in Standard Varnish Works v. Haydock, 143 Fed. 318, 319–20 (6th Cir. 1906), and In re Cann, 47
F.2d 661, 662 (W.D. Pa. 1931). And it has frequently been recognized that a creditor should not be allowed to
withdraw a claim after accepting a dividend. In re Friedmann, 1 Am. B. R. 510, 512 (Ref., S.D.N.Y. 1899); 3
Collier 205 (1964); cf. In re O'Gara Coal Co., 12 F.2d 426, 429 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 271 U.S. 683 (1926).
It was held in Industrial Credit Co. v. Hazen, 222 F.2d 225 (8th Cir. 1955), however, that although a claimant
had participated in the first meeting of creditors and in the examination of witnesses, the creditor was entitled
under Rule 41(a)(1) F.R.Civ.P. to withdraw the claim as of right by filing a notice of withdrawal before the
trustee filed an objection under §57g of the Act. While this rule incorporates the post-1938 case law referred
to in the first paragraph of this note, it rejects the inference drawn in the Hazen case that Rule 41(a) F.R.Civ.P.
supersedes the pre-1938 case law that vests discretion in the court to deny or restrict withdrawal of a claim by
a creditor on the ground of estoppel or election of remedies. While purely formal or technical participation in
a case by a creditor who has filed a claim should not deprive the creditor of the right to withdraw the claim, a
creditor who has accepted a dividend or who has voted in the election of a trustee or otherwise participated
actively in proceedings in a case should be permitted to withdraw only with the approval of the court on terms
it deems appropriate after notice to the trustee. 3 Collier 205–06 (1964).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This amendment is stylistic. Notice of the hearing need not be given to committees of equity security
holders appointed pursuant to §1102 or committees of retired employees appointed pursuant to §1114 of the
Code.
Rule 3007. Objections to Claims
(a) TIME AND MANNER OF SERVICE.
(1) Time of Service. An objection to the allowance of a claim and a notice of objection that
substantially conforms to the appropriate Official Form shall be filed and served at least 30 days
before any scheduled hearing on the objection or any deadline for the claimant to request a
hearing.
(2) Manner of Service.
(A) The objection and notice shall be served on a claimant by first-class mail to the person
most recently designated on the claimant's original or amended proof of claim as the person to
receive notices, at the address so indicated; and
(i) if the objection is to a claim of the United States, or any of its officers or agencies, in
the manner provided for service of a summons and complaint by Rule 7004(b)(4) or (5); or
(ii) if the objection is to a claim of an insured depository institution as defined in section 3
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, in the manner provided in Rule 7004(h).
(B) Service of the objection and notice shall also be made by first-class mail or other
permitted means on the debtor or debtor in possession, the trustee, and, if applicable, the entity
filing the proof of claim under Rule 3005.
(b) DEMAND FOR RELIEF REQUIRING AN ADVERSARY PROCEEDING. A party in
interest shall not include a demand for relief of a kind specified in Rule 7001 in an objection to the
allowance of a claim, but may include the objection in an adversary proceeding.
(c) LIMITATION ON JOINDER OF CLAIMS OBJECTIONS. Unless otherwise ordered by the
court or permitted by subdivision (d), objections to more than one claim shall not be joined in a
single objection.
(d) OMNIBUS OBJECTION. Subject to subdivision (e), objections to more than one claim may
be joined in an omnibus objection if all the claims were filed by the same entity, or the objections are
based solely on the grounds that the claims should be disallowed, in whole or in part, because:
(1) they duplicate other claims;
(2) they have been filed in the wrong case;
(3) they have been amended by subsequently filed proofs of claim;
[Release Point 118-106]
(4) they were not timely filed;
(5) they have been satisfied or released during the case in accordance with the Code, applicable
rules, or a court order;
(6) they were presented in a form that does not comply with applicable rules, and the objection
states that the objector is unable to determine the validity of the claim because of the
noncompliance;
(7) they are interests, rather than claims; or
(8) they assert priority in an amount that exceeds the maximum amount under §507 of the Code.
(e) REQUIREMENTS FOR OMNIBUS OBJECTION. An omnibus objection shall:
(1) state in a conspicuous place that claimants receiving the objection should locate their names
and claims in the objection;
(2) list claimants alphabetically, provide a cross-reference to claim numbers, and, if appropriate,
list claimants by category of claims;
(3) state the grounds of the objection to each claim and provide a cross-reference to the pages in
the omnibus objection pertinent to the stated grounds;
(4) state in the title the identity of the objector and the grounds for the objections;
(5) be numbered consecutively with other omnibus objections filed by the same objector; and
(6) contain objections to no more than 100 claims.
(f) FINALITY OF OBJECTION. The finality of any order regarding a claim objection included in
an omnibus objection shall be determined as though the claim had been subject to an individual
objection.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007; Apr. 27, 2017, eff.
Dec. 1, 2017; Apr. 14, 2021, eff. Dec. 1, 2021.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from §47a(8) of the Act and former Bankruptcy Rule 306. It prescribes the manner in
which an objection to a claim shall be made and notice of the hearing thereon given to the claimant. The
requirement of a writing does not apply to an objection to the allowance of a claim for the purpose of voting
for a trustee or creditors' committee in a chapter 7 case. See Rule 2003.
The contested matter initiated by an objection to a claim is governed by rule 9014, unless a counterclaim by
the trustee is joined with the objection to the claim. The filing of a counterclaim ordinarily commences an
adversary proceeding subject to the rules in Part VII.
While the debtor's other creditors may make objections to the allowance of a claim, the demands of orderly
and expeditious administration have led to a recognition that the right to object is generally exercised by the
trustee. Pursuant to §502(a) of the Code, however, any party in interest may object to a claim. But under §704
the trustee, if any purpose would be served thereby, has the duty to examine proofs of claim and object to
improper claims.
By virtue of the automatic allowance of a claim not objected to, a dividend may be paid on a claim which
may thereafter be disallowed on objection made pursuant to this rule. The amount of the dividend paid before
the disallowance in such event would be recoverable by the trustee in an adversary proceeding.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The words "with the court" are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2007 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended in a number of ways. First, the amendment prohibits a party in interest from including
in a claim objection a request for relief that requires an adversary proceeding. A party in interest may,
however, include an objection to the allowance of a claim in an adversary proceeding. Unlike a contested
matter, an adversary proceeding requires the service of a summons and complaint, which puts the defendant
on notice of the potential for an affirmative recovery. Permitting the plaintiff in the adversary proceeding to
include an objection to a claim would not unfairly surprise the defendant as might be the case if the action
were brought as a contested matter that included an action to obtain relief of a kind specified in Rule 7001.
The rule as amended does not require that a party include an objection to the allowance of a claim in an
adversary proceeding. If a claim objection is filed separately from a related adversary proceeding, the court
[Release Point 118-106]
may consolidate the objection with the adversary proceeding under Rule 7042.
The rule also is amended to authorize the filing of a pleading that joins objections to more than one claim.
Such filings present a significant opportunity for the efficient administration of large cases, but the rule
includes restrictions on the use of these omnibus objections to ensure the protection of the due process rights
of the claimants.
Unless the court orders otherwise, objections to more than one claim may be joined in a single pleading
only if all of the claims were filed by the same entity, or if the objections are based solely on the grounds set
out in subdivision (d) of the rule. Objections of the type listed in subdivision (d) often can be resolved without
material factual or legal disputes. Objections to multiple claims permitted under the rule must comply with the
procedural requirements set forth in subdivision (e). Among those requirements is the requirement in
subdivision (e)(5) that these omnibus objections be consecutively numbered. Since these objections may not
join more than 100 objections in any one omnibus objection, there may be a need for several omnibus
objections to be filed in a particular case. Consecutive numbering of each omnibus objection and the
identification of the objector in the title of the objection is essential to keep track of the objections on the
court's docket. For example, the objections could be titled Debtor in Possession's First Omnibus Objection to
Claims, Debtor in Possession's Second Omnibus Objection to Claims, Creditors' Committee's First Omnibus
Objection to Claims, and so on. Titling the objections in this manner should avoid confusion and aid in
tracking the objections on the docket.
Subdivision (f) provides that an order resolving an objection to any particular claim is treated, for purposes
of finality, as if the claim had been the subject of an individual objection. A party seeking to appeal any such
order is neither required, nor permitted, to await the court's resolution of all other joined objections. The rule
permits the joinder of objections for convenience, and that convenience should not impede timely review of a
court's decision with respect to each claim. Whether the court's action as to a particular objection is final, and
the consequences of that finality, are not addressed by this amendment. Moreover, use of an omnibus
objection generally does not preclude the objecting party from raising a subsequent objection to the claim on
other grounds. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments §26(1)(d) (1982) (generally applicable rule barring
multiple actions based on same transaction or series of transactions is overridden when a statutory scheme
permits splitting of claims).
Changes Made After Publication. There were several changes made to the rule after its publication. The
Advisory Committee declined to follow Mr. Sabino's suggestion, concluding that the rule as proposed includes
sufficient flexibility, and that expanding the flexibility might lead to excessive deviation from the appropriate
format for omnibus claims objections. The Advisory Committee also declined to follow Mr. Horsley's
suggestion because the deadline for filing a proof of claim varies based on the nature of the creditor
(governmental units have different deadlines from other creditors) as well as on the chapter under which the
case is pending. The Advisory Committee rejected Judge Grant's suggestion that a party proposing an omnibus
claims objection be required to demonstrate some special cause to allow the joinder of the objections. The
Advisory Committee concluded that the rule includes sufficient protections for claimants such that omnibus
objections should be allowed without the need for a special showing by the claims objector that joinder is
proper.
The Advisory Committee did accept several of Judge Grant's suggestions, and the rule was amended by
deleting the grounds for objection to claims based on the filing of a superceding proof of claim under
proposed subdivision (d)(3) and the transfer of claims under proposed subdivision (d)(4). Subdivision (d)(3)
now permits objections to claims that have been amended by a subsequently filed proof of claim and the
paragraphs within subdivision (d) have been renumbered to reflect the deletion. The Committee Note also no
longer includes any reliance on §502(j) for the statement indicating that a subsequent claim objection can be
filed to a claim that was previously included in an omnibus claim objection.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2017 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to specify the manner in which an objection to a claim and notice of the
objection must be served. It clarifies that Rule 7004 does not apply to the service of most claim objections.
Instead, a claimant must be served by first-class mail addressed to the person whom the claimant most
recently designated on its proof of claim to receive notices, at the address so indicated. If, however, the
claimant is the United States, an officer or agency of the United States, or an insured depository institution,
service must also be made according to the method prescribed by the appropriate provision of Rule 7004. The
service methods for the depository institutions are statutorily mandated, and the size and dispersal of the
decision-making and litigation authority of the federal government necessitate service on the appropriate
United States attorney's office and the Attorney General, as well as the person designated on the proof of
claim.
[Release Point 118-106]
As amended, subdivision (a) no longer requires that a hearing be scheduled or held on every objection. The
rule requires the objecting party to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the objection, but, by
deleting from the subdivision references to "the hearing," it permits local practices that require a claimant to
timely request a hearing or file a response in order to obtain a hearing. The official notice form served with a
copy of the objection will inform the claimant of any actions it must take. However, while a local rule may
require the claimant to respond to the objection to a proof of claim, the court will still need to determine if the
claim is valid, even if the claimant does not file a response to a claim objection or request a hearing.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2021 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a)(2)(A)(ii) is amended to clarify that the special service method required by Rule 7004(h)
must be used for service of objections to claims only on insured depository institutions as defined in section 3
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. §1813. Rule 7004(h) was enacted by Congress as part of the
Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994. It applies only to insured depository institutions that are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and does not include credit unions, which are instead insured by the
National Credit Union Administration. A credit union, therefore, may be served with an objection to a claim
according to Rule 3007(a)(2)(A)—by first-class mail sent to the person designated for receipt of notice on the
credit union's proof of claim.
REFERENCES IN TEXT
Section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, referred to in subd. (a)(2)(A)(ii), is classified to section
1813 of Title 12, Banks and Banking.
Rule 3008. Reconsideration of Claims
A party in interest may move for reconsideration of an order allowing or disallowing a claim
against the estate. The court after a hearing on notice shall enter an appropriate order.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Section 502(j) of the Code deals only with the reconsideration of allowed claims as did former §57k of the
Act and General Order 21(b). It had sometimes been held that a referee had no jurisdiction to reconsider a
disallowed claim, or the amount or priority of an allowed claim, at the instance of the claimant. See, e.g., In re
Gouse, 7 F. Supp. 106 (M.D. Pa. 1934); In re Tomlinson & Dye, Inc., 3 F. Supp. 800 (N.D. Okla. 1933). This
view disregarded §2a(2) of the Act and the "ancient and elementary power" of a referee as a court to
reconsider orders. In re Pottasch Brow. Co., Inc., 79 F.2d 613, 616 (2d Cir. 1935); Castaner v. Mora, 234
F.2d 710 (1st Cir. 1956). This rule recognizes, as did former Bankruptcy Rule 307, the power of the court to
reconsider an order of disallowance on appropriate motion.
Reconsideration of a claim that has been previously allowed or disallowed after objection is discretionary
with the court. The right to seek reconsideration of an allowed claim, like the right to object to its allowance,
is generally exercised by the trustee if one has qualified and is performing the duties of that office with
reasonable diligence and fidelity. A request for reconsideration of a disallowance would, on the other hand,
ordinarily come from the claimant.
A proof of claim executed and filed in accordance with the rules in this Part III is prima facie evidence of
the validity and the amount of the claim notwithstanding a motion for reconsideration of an order of
allowance. Failure to respond does not constitute an admission, though it may be deemed a consent to a
reconsideration. In re Goble Boat Co., 190 Fed. 92 (N.D.N.Y. 1911). The court may decline to reconsider an
order of allowance or disallowance without notice to any adverse party and without affording any hearing to
the movant. If a motion to reconsider is granted, notice and hearing must be afforded to parties in interest
before the previous action in the claim taken in respect to the claim may be vacated or modified. After
reconsideration, the court may allow or disallow the claim, increase or decrease the amount of a prior
allowance, accord the claim a priority different from that originally assigned it, or enter any other appropriate
order.
The rule expands §502(j) which provides for reconsideration of an allowance only before the case is closed.
Authorities have disagreed as to whether reconsideration may be had after a case has been reopened. Compare
3 Collier Bankruptcy 57.23[4] (14th ed. 1964), see generally 3 id. 502.10 (15th ed. 1979), with 2 Remington,
Bankruptcy 498 (Henderson ed. 1956). If a case is reopened as provided in §350(b) of the Code,
reconsideration of the allowance or disallowance of a claim may be sought and granted in accordance with
this rule.
[Release Point 118-106]
Rule 3009. Declaration and Payment of Dividends in a Chapter 7 Liquidation
Case
In a chapter 7 case, dividends to creditors shall be paid as promptly as practicable. Dividend
checks shall be made payable to and mailed to each creditor whose claim has been allowed, unless a
power of attorney authorizing another entity to receive dividends has been executed and filed in
accordance with Rule 9010. In that event, dividend checks shall be made payable to the creditor and
to the other entity and shall be mailed to the other entity.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Aug. 1, 1993.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Rules 308 and 11–35(a). The preparation of records showing dividends
declared and to whom payable is subject to prescription by the Director of the Administrative Office pursuant
to Rule 5003(e). The rule governs distributions to creditors having priority as well as to general unsecured
creditors. Notwithstanding the detailed statutory provisions regulating the declaration of dividends, a
necessarily wide discretion over this matter has been recognized to reside in the court. See 3A Collier,
Bankruptcy 65.03 (14th ed. 1975): 1 Proceedings of Seminar for Newly Appointed Referees in Bankruptcy 173
(1964). Although the rule leaves to the discretion of the court the amount and the times of dividend payments,
it recognizes the creditors' right to as prompt payment as practicable.
The second and third sentences of the rule make explicit the method of payment of dividends and afford
protection of the interests of the creditor and the holder of a power of attorney authorized to receive payment.
The rule does not permit variance at local option. This represents a marked change from former Bankruptcy
Rule 308.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to delete the requirement that the court approve the amounts and times of distributions
in chapter 7 cases. This change recognizes the role of the United States trustee in supervising trustees. Other
amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.
Rule 3010. Small Dividends and Payments in Cases Under Chapter 7,
Subchapter V of Chapter 11, Chapter 12, and Chapter 13
(a) CHAPTER 7 CASES. In a chapter 7 case no dividend in an amount less than $5 shall be
distributed by the trustee to any creditor unless authorized by local rule or order of the court. Any
dividend not distributed to a creditor shall be treated in the same manner as unclaimed funds as
provided in §347 of the Code.
(b) CASES UNDER SUBCHAPTER V OF CHAPTER 11, CHAPTER 12, AND CHAPTER 13.
In a case under subchapter V of chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13, no payment in an amount less
than $15 shall be distributed by the trustee to any creditor unless authorized by local rule or order of
the court. Funds not distributed because of this subdivision shall accumulate and shall be paid
whenever the accumulation aggregates $15. Any funds remaining shall be distributed with the final
payment.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 11, 2022, eff.
Dec. 1, 2022.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule permits a court to eliminate the disproportionate expense and inconvenience incurred by the
issuance of a dividend check of less than $5 (or $15 in a chapter 13 case). Creditors are more irritated than
pleased to receive such small dividends, but the money is held subject to their specific request as are
unclaimed dividends under §347(a) of the Code. When the trustee deposits undistributed dividends pursuant to
a direction in accordance with this rule the trustee should file with the clerk a list of the names and addresses,
so far as known, of the persons entitled to the money so deposited and the respective amounts payable to them
[Release Point 118-106]
pursuant to Rule 3011. In a chapter 13 case, the small dividend will accumulate and will be payable at the
latest, with the final dividend. Local rule or order may change the practice permitted in this rule and, in that
connection, the order may be incorporated in the order confirming a chapter 13 plan.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is amended to include chapter 12 cases.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended in response to the enactment of the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, Pub.
L. No. 116–54, 133 Stat. 1079. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to be a debtor
under subchapter V of chapter 11. To avoid the undue cost and inconvenience of distributing small payments,
the title and subdivision (b) are amended to include subchapter V cases.
Rule 3011. Unclaimed Funds in Cases Under Chapter 7, Subchapter V of
Chapter 11, Chapter 12, and Chapter 13
(a) The trustee shall file a list of all known names and addresses of the entities and the amounts
which they are entitled to be paid from remaining property of the estate that is paid into court
pursuant to §347 1 of the Code.
(b) On the court's website, the clerk must provide searchable access to information about funds
deposited under §347(a). The court may, for cause, limit access to information about funds in a
specific case.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 11, 2022, eff.
Dec. 1, 2022; Apr. 24, 2023, eff. Dec. 1, 2023.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 310. The operative provisions of that rule, however, are
contained in §347(a) of the Code, requiring the trustee to stop payment of checks remaining unpaid 90 days
after distribution. The rule adds the requirement of filing a list of the names and addresses of the persons
entitled to these dividends. This rule applies in a chapter 7 or 13 case but not in a chapter 9 or 11 case. The
latter cases are governed by §347(b) of the Code which provides for unclaimed distributions to be returned to
the debtor or other entity acquiring the assets of the debtor.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The title of this rule is amended to include chapter 12 cases. The words "with the clerk" are deleted as
unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended in response to the enactment of the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, Pub.
L. No. 116–54, 133 Stat. 1079. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to be a debtor
under subchapter V of chapter 11. The rule is amended to include such cases because §347(a) of the Code
applies to them.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2023 AMENDMENT
Rule 3011 is amended to require the clerk to provide searchable access (as by providing a link to the U.S.
Bankruptcy Unclaimed Funds Locator) on the court's website to information about unclaimed funds deposited
pursuant to §347(a). The court may limit access to information about such funds in a specific case for cause,
including, for example, if such access risks disclosing the identity of claimants whose privacy should be
protected, or if the information about the unclaimed funds is so old as to be unreliable.
1 So in House Document 118–32. Probably should be "§347(a)". Prior to amendment, such
reference was to "§347(a)", and while proposed amendment in House Document 118–32
contained only "§347", it did not explicitly delete "(a)".
[Release Point 118-106]
Rule 3012. Determining the Amount of Secured and Priority Claims
(a) DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF CLAIM. On request by a party in interest and after
notice—to the holder of the claim and any other entity the court designates—and a hearing, the court
may determine:
(1) the amount of a secured claim under §506(a) of the Code; or
(2) the amount of a claim entitled to priority under §507 of the Code.
(b) REQUEST FOR DETERMINATION; HOW MADE. Except as provided in subdivision (c), a
request to determine the amount of a secured claim may be made by motion, in a claim objection, or
in a plan filed in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case. When the request is made in a chapter 12 or chapter
13 plan, the plan shall be served on the holder of the claim and any other entity the court designates
in the manner provided for service of a summons and complaint by Rule 7004. A request to
determine the amount of a claim entitled to priority may be made only by motion after a claim is
filed or in a claim objection.
(c) CLAIMS OF GOVERNMENTAL UNITS. A request to determine the amount of a secured
claim of a governmental unit may be made only by motion or in a claim objection after the
governmental unit files a proof of claim or after the time for filing one under Rule 3002(c)(1) has
expired.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Pursuant to §506(a) of the Code, secured claims are to be valued and allowed as secured to the extent of the
value of the collateral and unsecured, to the extent it is enforceable, for the excess over such value. The
valuation of secured claims may become important in different contexts e.g., to determine the issue of
adequate protection under §361, impairment under §1124, or treatment of the claim in a plan pursuant to
§1129(b) of the Code. This rule permits the issue to be raised on motion by a party in interest. The secured
creditor is entitled to notice of the hearing on the motion and the court may direct that others in the case also
receive such notice.
An adversary proceeding is commenced when the validity, priority, or extent of a lien is at issue as
prescribed by Rule 7001. That proceeding is relevant to the basis of the lien itself while valuation under Rule
3012 would be for the purposes indicated above.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2017 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended and reorganized.
Subdivision (a) provides, in keeping with the former version of this rule, that a party in interest may seek a
determination of the amount of a secured claim. The amended rule provides that the amount of a claim entitled
to priority may also be determined by the court.
Subdivision (b) is added to provide that a request to determine the amount of a secured claim may be made
in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 plan, as well as by a motion or a claim objection. When the request is made in a
plan, the plan must be served on the holder of the claim and any other entities the court designates according
to Rule 7004. Secured claims of governmental units are not included in this subdivision and are governed by
subdivision (c). The amount of a claim entitled to priority may be determined through a motion or a claim
objection.
Subdivision (c) clarifies that a determination under this rule with respect to a secured claim of a
governmental unit may be made only by motion or in a claim objection, but not until the governmental unit
has filed a proof of claim or its time for filing a proof of claim has expired.
Rule 3013. Classification of Claims and Interests
For the purposes of the plan and its acceptance, the court may, on motion after hearing on notice
as the court may direct, determine classes of creditors and equity security holders pursuant to
§§1122, 1222(b)(1), and 1322(b)(1) of the Code.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
[Release Point 118-106]
Sections 1122 and 1322(b)(1) set the standards for classifying claims and interests but provide that such
classification is accomplished in the plan. This rule does not change the standards; rather it recognizes that it
may be desirable or necessary to establish proper classification before a plan can be formulated. It provides for
a court hearing on such notice as the court may direct.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to include chapter 12 cases.
Rule 3014. Election Under §1111(b) by Secured Creditor in Chapter 9
Municipality or Chapter 11 Reorganization Case
An election of application of §1111(b)(2) of the Code by a class of secured creditors in a chapter 9
or 11 case may be made at any time prior to the conclusion of the hearing on the disclosure statement
or within such later time as the court may fix. If the disclosure statement is conditionally approved
pursuant to Rule 3017.1, and a final hearing on the disclosure statement is not held, the election of
application of §1111(b)(2) may be made not later than the date fixed pursuant to Rule 3017.1(a)(2)
or another date the court may fix. In a case under subchapter V of chapter 11 in which §1125 of the
Code does not apply, the election may be made not later than a date the court may fix. The election
shall be in writing and signed unless made at the hearing on the disclosure statement. The election, if
made by the majorities required by §1111(b)(1)(A)(i), shall be binding on all members of the class
with respect to the plan.
(As amended Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997; Apr. 11, 2022, eff. Dec. 1, 2022.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Pursuant to §1111(b)(1) of the Code, a nonrecourse secured loan is converted, automatically, into a recourse
loan thereby entitling the creditor to an unsecured deficiency claim if the value of the collateral is less than the
debt. The class, however, may retain the loan as a nonrecourse loan by electing application of §1111(b)(2) by
the majorities stated in §1111(b)(1)(A)(i). That section does not specify any time periods for making the
election.
Rule 3014 provides that if no agreement is negotiated, the election of §1111(b)(2) of the Code may be made
at any time prior to conclusion of the hearing on the disclosure statement. Once the hearing has been
concluded, it would be too late for a secured creditor class to demand different treatment unless the court has
fixed a later time. This would be the case if, for example, a public class of secured creditors should have an
approved disclosure statement prior to electing under §1111(b).
Generally it is important that the proponent of a plan ascertain the position of the secured creditor class
before a plan is proposed. The secured creditor class must know the prospects of its treatment under the plan
before it can intelligently determine its rights under §1111(b). The rule recognizes that there may be
negotiations between the proponent of the plan and the secured creditor leading to a representation of desired
treatment under §1111(b). If that treatment is approved by the requisite majorities of the class and culminates
in a written, signed statement filed with the court, that statement becomes binding and the class may not
thereafter demand different treatment under §1111(b) with respect to that plan. The proponent of the plan is
thus enabled to seek approval of the disclosure statement and transmit the plan for voting in anticipation of
confirmation. Only if that plan is not confirmed may the class of secured creditors thereafter change its prior
election.
While this rule and the Code refer to a class of secured creditors it should be noted that ordinarily each
secured creditor is in a separate and distinct class. In that event, the secured creditor has the sole power to
determine application of §1111(b) with respect to that claim.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1997 AMENDMENT
This amendment provides a deadline for electing application of §1111(b)(2) in a small business case in
which a conditionally approved disclosure statement is finally approved without a hearing.
GAP Report on Rule 3014. No changes to the published draft.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended in response to the enactment of the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, Pub.
L. No. 116–54, 133 Stat. 1079. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to be a debtor
[Release Point 118-106]
under subchapter V of chapter 11. Because there generally will not be a disclosure statement in a subchapter V
case, see §1181(b) of the Code, the rule is amended to provide a deadline for making an election under
§1111(b) in such cases that is set by the court.
Rule 3015. Filing, Objection to Confirmation, Effect of Confirmation, and
Modification of a Plan in a Chapter 12 or a Chapter 13 Case
(a) FILING A CHAPTER 12 PLAN. The debtor may file a chapter 12 plan with the petition. If a
plan is not filed with the petition, it shall be filed within the time prescribed by §1221 of the Code.
(b) FILING A CHAPTER 13 PLAN. The debtor may file a chapter 13 plan with the petition. If a
plan is not filed with the petition, it shall be filed within 14 days thereafter, and such time may not be
further extended except for cause shown and on notice as the court may direct. If a case is converted
to chapter 13, a plan shall be filed within 14 days thereafter, and such time may not be further
extended except for cause shown and on notice as the court may direct.
(c) FORM OF CHAPTER 13 PLAN. If there is an Official Form for a plan filed in a chapter 13
case, that form must be used unless a Local Form has been adopted in compliance with Rule 3015.1.
With either the Official Form or a Local Form, a nonstandard provision is effective only if it is
included in a section of the form designated for nonstandard provisions and is also identified in
accordance with any other requirements of the form. As used in this rule and the Official Form or a
Local Form, "nonstandard provision" means a provision not otherwise included in the Official or
Local Form or deviating from it.
(d) NOTICE. If the plan is not included with the notice of the hearing on confirmation mailed
under Rule 2002, the debtor shall serve the plan on the trustee and all creditors when it is filed with
the court.
(e) TRANSMISSION TO UNITED STATES TRUSTEE. The clerk shall forthwith transmit to the
United States trustee a copy of the plan and any modification thereof filed under subdivision (a) or
(b) of this rule.
(f) OBJECTION TO CONFIRMATION; DETERMINATION OF GOOD FAITH IN THE
ABSENCE OF AN OBJECTION. An objection to confirmation of a plan shall be filed and served on
the debtor, the trustee, and any other entity designated by the court, and shall be transmitted to the
United States trustee, at least seven days before the date set for the hearing on confirmation, unless
the court orders otherwise. An objection to confirmation is governed by Rule 9014. If no objection is
timely filed, the court may determine that the plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any
means forbidden by law without receiving evidence on such issues.
(g) EFFECT OF CONFIRMATION. Upon the confirmation of a chapter 12 or chapter 13 plan:
(1) any determination in the plan made under Rule 3012 about the amount of a secured claim is
binding on the holder of the claim, even if the holder files a contrary proof of claim or the debtor
schedules that claim, and regardless of whether an objection to the claim has been filed; and
(2) any request in the plan to terminate the stay imposed by §362(a), §1201(a), or §1301(a) is
granted.
(h) MODIFICATION OF PLAN AFTER CONFIRMATION. A request to modify a plan under
§1229 or §1329 of the Code shall identify the proponent and shall be filed together with the proposed
modification. The clerk, or some other person as the court may direct, shall give the debtor, the
trustee, and all creditors not less than 21 days' notice by mail of the time fixed for filing objections
and, if an objection is filed, the hearing to consider the proposed modification, unless the court
orders otherwise with respect to creditors who are not affected by the proposed modification. A copy
of the notice shall be transmitted to the United States trustee. A copy of the proposed modification,
or a summary thereof, shall be included with the notice. Any objection to the proposed modification
shall be filed and served on the debtor, the trustee, and any other entity designated by the court, and
shall be transmitted to the United States trustee. An objection to a proposed modification is governed
by Rule 9014.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Aug. 1, 1993; Mar. 26, 2009, eff.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Section 1321 provides only that the "debtor shall file a plan." No time periods are specified, nor is any other
detail provided. The rule requires a chapter 13 plan to be filed either with the petition or within 15 days
thereafter. The court may, for cause, extend the time. The rule permits a summary of the plan to be transmitted
with the notice of the hearing on confirmation. The court may, however, require the plan itself to be
transmitted and the debtor to supply enough copies for this purpose. In the former rules under Chapter XIII the
plan would accompany the notice of the first meeting of creditors. It is more important for the plan or a
summary of its terms to be sent with the notice of the confirmation hearing. At that hearing objections to the
plan will be heard by the court.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to include chapter 12 plans. Section 1221 of the Code requires the debtor to file a
chapter 12 plan not later than 90 days after the order for relief, except that the court may extend the period if
an extension is "substantially justified."
Subdivision (e) enables the United States trustee to monitor chapter 12 and chapter 13 plans pursuant to 28
U.S.C. §586(a)(3)(C).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is amended to provide a time limit for filing a plan after a case has been converted to
chapter 13. The substitution of "may" for "shall" is stylistic and makes no substantive change.
Subdivision (d) is amended to clarify that the plan or a summary of the plan must be included with each
notice of the confirmation hearing in a chapter 12 case pursuant to Rule 2002(a).
Subdivision (f) is added to expand the scope of the rule to govern objections to confirmation in chapter 12
and chapter 13 cases. The subdivision also is amended to include a provision that permits the court, in the
absence of an objection, to determine that the plan has been proposed in good faith and and not by any means
forbidden by law without the need to receive evidence on these issues. These matters are now governed by
Rule 3020.
Subdivision (g) is added to provide a procedure for post-confirmation modification of chapter 12 and
chapter 13 plans. These procedures are designed to be similar to the procedures for confirmation of plans.
However, if no objection is filed with respect to a proposed modification of a plan after confirmation, the
court is not required to hold a hearing. See §1229(b)(2) and §1329(b)(2) which provide that the plan as
modified becomes the plan unless, after notice and a hearing, such modification is disapproved. See §102(1).
The notice of the time fixed for filing objections to the proposed modification should set a date for a hearing
to be held in the event that an objection is filed.
Amendments to the title of this rule are stylistic and make no substantive change.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2017 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended and reorganized.
Subdivision (c) is amended to require use of an Official Form if one is adopted for chapter 13 plans unless a
Local Form has been adopted consistent with Rule 3015.1. Subdivision (c) also provides that nonstandard
provisions in a chapter 13 plan must be set out in the section of the Official or Local Form specifically
designated for such provisions and must be identified in the manner required by the Official or Local Form.
Subdivision (d) is amended to ensure that the trustee and creditors are served with the plan before
confirmation. Service may be made either at the time the plan is filed or with the notice under Rule 2002 of
the hearing to consider confirmation of the plan.
Subdivision (f) is amended to require service of an objection to confirmation at least seven days before the
[Release Point 118-106]
hearing to consider confirmation of a plan, unless the court orders otherwise.
Subdivision (g) is amended to set out two effects of confirmation. Subdivision (g)(1) provides that the
amount of a secured claim under §506(a) may be determined through a chapter 12 or chapter 13 plan in
accordance with Rule 3012. That determination, unlike the amount of any current installment payments or
arrearages, controls over a contrary proof of claim, without the need for a claim objection under Rule 3007,
and over the schedule submitted by the debtor under §521(a). The amount of a secured claim of a
governmental unit, however, may not be determined through a chapter 12 or chapter 13 plan under Rule 3012.
Subdivision (g)(2) provides for termination of the automatic stay under §§362, 1201, and 1301 as requested in
the plan.
Subdivision (h) was formerly subdivision (g). It is redesignated and is amended to reflect that often the
party proposing a plan modification is responsible for serving the proposed modification on other parties. The
option to serve a summary of the proposed modification has been retained. Unless required by another rule,
service under this subdivision does not need to be made in the manner provided for service of a summons and
complaint by Rule 7004.
Rule 3015.1. Requirements for a Local Form for Plans Filed in a Chapter 13
Case
Notwithstanding Rule 9029(a)(1), a district may require that a Local Form for a plan filed in a
chapter 13 case be used instead of an Official Form adopted for that purpose if the following
conditions are satisfied:
(a) a single Local Form is adopted for the district after public notice and an opportunity for public
comment;
(b) each paragraph is numbered and labeled in boldface type with a heading stating the general
subject matter of the paragraph;
(c) the Local Form includes an initial paragraph for the debtor to indicate that the plan does or
does not:
(1) contain any nonstandard provision;
(2) limit the amount of a secured claim based on a valuation of the collateral for the claim; or
(3) avoid a security interest or lien;
(d) the Local Form contains separate paragraphs for:
(1) curing any default and maintaining payments on a claim secured by the debtor's principal
residence;
(2) paying a domestic-support obligation;
(3) paying a claim described in the final paragraph of §1325(a) of the Bankruptcy Code; and
(4) surrendering property that secures a claim with a request that the stay under §§362(a) and
1301(a) be terminated as to the surrendered collateral; and
(e) the Local Form contains a final paragraph for:
(1) the placement of nonstandard provisions, as defined in Rule 3015(c), along with a statement
that any nonstandard provision placed elsewhere in the plan is void; and
(2) certification by the debtor's attorney or by an unrepresented debtor that the plan contains no
nonstandard provision other than those set out in the final paragraph.
(Added Apr. 27, 2017, eff. Dec. 1, 2017.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2017
This rule is new. It sets out features required for all Local Forms for plans in chapter 13 cases. If a Local
Form does not comply with this rule, it may not be used in lieu of the Official Chapter 13 Plan Form. See Rule
3015(c).
Under the rule only one Local Form may be adopted in a district. The rule does not specify the method of
adoption, but it does require that adoption of a Local Form be preceded by a public notice and comment
period.
To promote consistency among Local Forms and clarity of content of chapter 13 plans, the rule prescribes
[Release Point 118-106]
several formatting and disclosure requirements. Paragraphs in such a form must be numbered and labeled in
bold type, and the form must contain separate paragraphs for the cure and maintenance of home mortgages,
payment of domestic support obligations, treatment of secured claims covered by the "hanging paragraph" of
§1325(a), and surrender of property securing a claim. Whether those portions of the Local Form are used in a
given chapter 13 case will depend on the debtor's individual circumstances.
The rule requires that a Local Form begin with a paragraph for the debtor to call attention to the fact that the
plan contains a nonstandard provision; limits the amount of a secured claim based on a valuation of the
collateral, as authorized by Rule 3012(b); or avoids a lien, as authorized by Rule 4003(d).
The last paragraph of a Local Form must be for the inclusion of any nonstandard provisions, as defined by
Rule 3015(c), and must include a statement that nonstandard provisions placed elsewhere in the plan are void.
This part gives the debtor the opportunity to propose provisions that are not otherwise in, or that deviate from,
the Local Form. The form must also require a certification by the debtor's attorney or unrepresented debtor
that there are no nonstandard provisions other than those placed in the final paragraph.
Rule 3016. Filing of Plan and Disclosure Statement in a Chapter 9 Municipality
or Chapter 11 Reorganization Case
(a) IDENTIFICATION OF PLAN. Every proposed plan and any modification thereof shall be
dated and, in a chapter 11 case, identified with the name of the entity or entities submitting or filing
it.
(b) DISCLOSURE STATEMENT. In a chapter 9 or 11 case, a disclosure statement, if required
under §1125 of the Code, or evidence showing compliance with §1126(b) shall be filed with the plan
or within a time fixed by the court, unless the plan is intended to provide adequate information under
§1125(f)(1). If the plan is intended to provide adequate information under §1125(f)(1), it shall be so
designated, and Rule 3017.1 shall apply as if the plan is a disclosure statement.
(c) INJUNCTION UNDER A PLAN. If a plan provides for an injunction against conduct not
otherwise enjoined under the Code, the plan and disclosure statement shall describe in specific and
conspicuous language (bold, italic, or underlined text) all acts to be enjoined and identify the entities
that would be subject to the injunction.
(d) STANDARD FORM SMALL BUSINESS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND PLAN. In a
small business case or a case under subchapter V of chapter 11, the court may approve a disclosure
statement and may confirm a plan that conform substantially to the appropriate Official Forms or
other standard forms approved by the court.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 23, 1996, eff.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule implements the Code provisions concerning the filing of plans in chapters 9 and 11.
Chapter 9 Cases. Section 941 provides that the debtor may file a plan with the petition or thereafter but
within a time fixed by the court. A rule, therefore, is unnecessary to specify the time for filing chapter 9 plans.
Chapter 11 Nonrailroad Cases. Section 1121 contains detailed provisions with respect to who may file a
chapter 11 plan and, in part, the time period. Section 1121(a) permits a debtor to file a plan with the petition or
at any time during the case. Section 1121(b) and (c) grants exclusive periods of 120 days and 180 days for the
debtor to file and obtain acceptance of a plan. Failure to take advantage of these periods or the appointment of
a trustee would permit other parties in interest to file a plan. These statutory provisions are not repeated in the
rules.
Chapter 11 Railroad Cases. Pursuant to subchapter IV of chapter 11, §1121 of the Code is applicable in
railroad cases; see §§1161, 103(g). A trustee, however, is to be appointed in every case; thus, pursuant to
§1121(c), any party in interest may file a plan. See discussion of subdivision (a) of this rule, infra.
Subdivision (a). Section 1121(c), while permitting parties in interest a limited right to file plans, does not
provide any time limitation. This subdivision sets as the deadline, the conclusion of the hearing on the
disclosure statement. The court may, however, grant additional time. It is derived from former Chapter X Rule
10–301(c)(2) which used, as the cut-off time, the conclusion of the hearing on approval of a plan. As
indicated, supra, §1121(a) permits a debtor to file a plan at any time during the chapter 11 case. Under
[Release Point 118-106]
§1121(c), parties other than a debtor may file a plan only after a trustee is appointed or the debtor's exclusive
time expires.
Subdivision (b) requires plans to be properly identified.
Subdivision (c). This provision is new. In chapter 9 and 11 cases (including railroad reorganization cases)
postpetition solicitation of votes on a plan requires transmittal of a disclosure statement, the contents of which
have been approved by the court. See §1125 of the Code. A prepetition solicitation must either have been in
conformity with applicable nonbankruptcy law or, if none, the disclosure must have been of adequate
information as set forth in §1125 of the Code. See §1126(b). Subdivision (c) of this rule provides the time for
filing the disclosure statement or evidence of compliance with §1126(b) which ordinarily will be with the plan
but the court may allow a later time or the court may, pursuant to the last sentence, fix a time certain. Rule
3017 deals with the hearing on the disclosure statement. The disclosure statement, pursuant to §1125 is to
contain adequate information. "Adequate information" is defined in §1125(a) as information that would permit
a reasonable creditor or equity security holder to make an informed judgment on the plan.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to enlarge the time for filing competing plans. A party in interest may not file a
plan without leave of court only if an order approving a disclosure statement relating to another plan has been
entered and a decision on confirmation of the plan has not been entered. This subdivision does not fix a
deadline beyond which a debtor may not file a plan.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1996 AMENDMENT
Section 1121(c) gives a party in interest the right to file a chapter 11 plan after expiration of the period
when only the debtor may file a plan. Under §1121(d), the exclusive period in which only the debtor may file
a plan may be extended, but only if a party in interest so requests and the court, after notice and a hearing,
finds cause for an extension. Subdivision (a) is abrogated because it could have the effect of extending the
debtor's exclusive period for filing a plan without satisfying the requirements of §1121(d). The abrogation of
subdivision (a) does not affect the court's discretion with respect to the scheduling of hearings on the approval
of disclosure statements when more than one plan has been filed.
The amendment to subdivision (c), redesignated as subdivision (b), is stylistic.
GAP Report on Rule 3016. No changes since publication, except for a stylistic change.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2001 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c) is added to assure that entities whose conduct would be enjoined under a plan, rather than
by operation of the Code, are given adequate notice of the proposed injunction. The validity and effect of any
injunction are substantive law matters that are beyond the scope of these rules.
Specific and conspicuous language is not necessary if the injunction contained in the plan is substantially
the same as an injunction provided under the Code. For example, if a plan contains an injunction against acts
to collect a discharged debt from the debtor, Rule 3016(c) would not apply because that conduct would be
enjoined nonetheless under §524(a)(2). But if a plan provides that creditors will be permanently enjoined from
asserting claims against persons who are not debtors in the case, the plan and disclosure statement must
highlight the injunctive language and comply with the requirements of Rule 3016(c). See §524(e).
The requirement in this rule that the plan and disclosure statement identify the entities that would be subject
to the injunction requires reasonable identification under the circumstances. If the entities that would be
subject to the injunction cannot be identified by name, the plan and disclosure statement may describe them by
class or category. For example, it may be sufficient to identify the subjects of the injunction as "all creditors of
the debtor."
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. The word "highlighted" in the parenthesis was replaced
with "underlined" because highlighted documents are difficult to scan electronically for inclusion in the clerks'
files. The Committee Note was revised to put in a more prominent position the statement that the validity and
effect of any injunction provided for in a plan are substantive matters beyond the scope of the rules. Other
stylistic changes were made to the Committee Note.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is amended to recognize that, in 2005, §1125(f)(1) was added to the Code to provide that
the plan proponent in a small business case need not file a disclosure statement if the plan itself includes
adequate information and the court finds that a separate disclosure statement is unnecessary. If the plan is
intended to provide adequate information in a small business case, it may be conditionally approved as a
disclosure statement under Rule 3017.1 and is subject to all other rules applicable to disclosure statements in
small business cases.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subdivision (d) is added to the rule to implement §433 of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
Protection Act of 2005 which requires the promulgation of Official Forms for plans and disclosure statements
in small business cases. Section 1125(f)(2) of the Code provides that the court may approve a disclosure
statement submitted on the appropriate Official Form or on a standard form approved by the court. The rule
takes no position on whether a court may require a local standard form disclosure statement or plan of
reorganization in lieu of the Official Forms.
Other amendments are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended in response to the enactment of the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, Pub.
L. No. 116–54, 133 Stat. 1079. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to be a debtor
under subchapter V of chapter 11. Subdivision (b) of the rule is amended to reflect that under §1181(b) of the
Code, §1125 does not apply to subchapter V cases (and thus a disclosure statement is not required) unless the
court for cause orders otherwise. Subdivision (d) is amended to include subchapter V cases as ones in which
Official Forms are available for a reorganization plan and, when required, a disclosure statement.
Rule 3017. Court Consideration of Disclosure Statement in a Chapter 9
Municipality or Chapter 11 Reorganization Case
(a) HEARING ON DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND OBJECTIONS. Except as provided in
Rule 3017.1, after a disclosure statement is filed in accordance with Rule 3016(b), the court shall
hold a hearing on at least 28 days' notice to the debtor, creditors, equity security holders and other
parties in interest as provided in Rule 2002 to consider the disclosure statement and any objections or
modifications thereto. The plan and the disclosure statement shall be mailed with the notice of the
hearing only to the debtor, any trustee or committee appointed under the Code, the Securities and
Exchange Commission and any party in interest who requests in writing a copy of the statement or
plan. Objections to the disclosure statement shall be filed and served on the debtor, the trustee, any
committee appointed under the Code, and any other entity designated by the court, at any time before
the disclosure statement is approved or by an earlier date as the court may fix. In a chapter 11
reorganization case, every notice, plan, disclosure statement, and objection required to be served or
mailed pursuant to this subdivision shall be transmitted to the United States trustee within the time
provided in this subdivision.
(b) DETERMINATION ON DISCLOSURE STATEMENT. Following the hearing the court shall
determine whether the disclosure statement should be approved.
(c) DATES FIXED FOR VOTING ON PLAN AND CONFIRMATION. On or before approval of
the disclosure statement, the court shall fix a time within which the holders of claims and interests
may accept or reject the plan and may fix a date for the hearing on confirmation.
(d) TRANSMISSION AND NOTICE TO UNITED STATES TRUSTEE, CREDITORS, AND
EQUITY SECURITY HOLDERS. Upon approval of a disclosure statement,— 1 except to the extent
that the court orders otherwise with respect to one or more unimpaired classes of creditors or equity
security holders—the debtor in possession, trustee, proponent of the plan, or clerk as the court orders
shall mail to all creditors and equity security holders, and in a chapter 11 reorganization case shall
transmit to the United States trustee,
(1) the plan or a court-approved summary of the plan;
(2) the disclosure statement approved by the court;
(3) notice of the time within which acceptances and rejections of the plan may be filed; and
(4) any other information as the court may direct, including any court opinion approving the
disclosure statement or a court-approved summary of the opinion.
In addition, notice of the time fixed for filing objections and the hearing on confirmation shall be
mailed to all creditors and equity security holders in accordance with Rule 2002(b), and a form of
ballot conforming to the appropriate Official Form shall be mailed to creditors and equity security
holders entitled to vote on the plan. If the court opinion is not transmitted or only a summary of the
[Release Point 118-106]
plan is transmitted, the court opinion or the plan shall be provided on request of a party in interest at
the plan proponent's expense. If the court orders that the disclosure statement and the plan or a
summary of the plan shall not be mailed to any unimpaired class, notice that the class is designated
in the plan as unimpaired and notice of the name and address of the person from whom the plan or
summary of the plan and disclosure statement may be obtained upon request and at the plan
proponent's expense, shall be mailed to members of the unimpaired class together with the notice of
the time fixed for filing objections to and the hearing on confirmation. For the purposes of this
subdivision, creditors and equity security holders shall include holders of stock, bonds, debentures,
notes, and other securities of record on the date the order approving the disclosure statement is
entered or another date fixed by the court, for cause, after notice and a hearing.
(e) TRANSMISSION TO BENEFICIAL HOLDERS OF SECURITIES. At the hearing held
pursuant to subdivision (a) of this rule, the court shall consider the procedures for transmitting the
documents and information required by subdivision (d) of this rule to beneficial holders of stock,
bonds, debentures, notes, and other securities, determine the adequacy of the procedures, and enter
any orders the court deems appropriate.
(f) NOTICE AND TRANSMISSION OF DOCUMENTS TO ENTITIES SUBJECT TO AN
INJUNCTION UNDER A PLAN. If a plan provides for an injunction against conduct not otherwise
enjoined under the Code and an entity that would be subject to the injunction is not a creditor or
equity security holder, at the hearing held under Rule 3017(a), the court shall consider procedures for
providing the entity with:
(1) at least 28 days' notice of the time fixed for filing objections and the hearing on confirmation
of the plan containing the information described in Rule 2002(c)(3); and
(2) to the extent feasible, a copy of the plan and disclosure statement.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 11, 1997, eff.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is adapted from former Rule 10–303 which dealt with the approval of a Chapter X plan by the
court. There is no requirement for plan approval in a chapter 9 or 11 case under the Code but there is the
requirement that a disclosure statement containing adequate financial information be approved by the court
after notice and a hearing before votes on a plan are solicited. Section 1125(b) of the Code is made applicable
in chapter 9 cases by §901(a). It is also applicable in railroad reorganization cases under subchapter IV of
chapter 11; see §1161 of the Code.
Subdivision (a) of this rule provides for the hearing on the disclosure statement. Thus, a hearing would be
required in all cases; whether it may be ex parte would depend on the circumstances of the case, but a mere
absence of objections would not eliminate the need for a hearing; see §102(1) of the Code.
No provision similar to former Rule 10–303(f) is included. That subdivision together with former Rule
10–304 prohibited solicitation of votes until after entry of an order approving the plan. Section 1125(b) of the
Code explicitly provides that votes on a plan may not be solicited until a disclosure statement approved by the
court is transmitted. Pursuant to the change in rulemaking power, a comparable provision in this rule is
unnecessary. 28 U.S.C. §2075.
Copies of the disclosure statement and plan need not be mailed with the notice of the hearing or otherwise
transmitted prior to the hearing except with respect to the parties explicitly set forth in the subdivision.
It should be noted that, by construction, the singular includes the plural. Therefore, the phrase "plan or
plans" or "disclosure statement or statements" has not been used although the possibility of multiple plans and
statements is recognized.
Subdivision (d) permits the court to require a party other than the clerk of the bankruptcy court to bear the
responsibility for transmitting the notices and documents specified in the rule when votes on the plan are
solicited. Ordinarily the person responsible for such mailing will be the proponent of the plan. In rare cases the
clerk may be directed to mail these documents, particularly when the trustee would have the responsibility but
there is insufficient money in the estate to enable the trustee to perform this task.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (d). Section 1125(c) of the Code requires that the entire approved disclosure statement be
provided in connection with voting on a plan. The court is authorized by §1125(c) to approve different
disclosure statements for different classes. Although the rule does not permit the mailing of a summary of the
[Release Point 118-106]
disclosure statement in place of the approved disclosure statement, the court may approve a summary of the
disclosure statement to be mailed with the complete disclosure statement to those voting on the plan.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to enable the United States trustee to monitor and comment with regard to chapter 11
disclosure statements and plans. The United States trustee does not perform these functions in a chapter 9
municipal debt adjustment case. See 28 U.S.C. §586(a)(3)(B).
Subdivision (d) is amended to give the court the discretion to direct that one or more unimpaired classes
shall not receive disclosure statements, plans, or summaries of plans. Members of unimpaired classes are not
entitled to vote on the plan. Although disclosure statements enable members of unimpaired classes to make
informed judgments as to whether to object to confirmation because of lack of feasibility or other grounds, in
an unusual case the court may direct that disclosure statements shall not be sent to such classes if to do so
would not be feasible considering the size of the unimpaired classes and the expense of printing and mailing.
In any event, all creditors are entitled to notice of the time fixed for filing objections and notice of the hearing
to consider confirmation of the plan pursuant to Rule 2002(b) and the requirement of such notice may not be
excused with respect to unimpaired classes. The amendment to subdivision (d) also ensures that the members
of unimpaired classes who do not receive such documents will have sufficient information so that they may
request these documents in advance of the hearing on confirmation. The amendment to subdivision (d) is not
intended to give the court the discretion to dispense with the mailing of the plan and disclosure statement to
governmental units holding claims entitled to priority under §507(a)(7) because they may not be classified.
See §1123(a)(1).
The words "with the court" in subdivision (a) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
Reference to the Official Form number in subdivision (d) is deleted in anticipation of future revision and
renumbering of the Official Forms.
Subdivision (e) is designed to ensure that appropriate measures are taken for the plan, disclosure statement,
ballot and other materials which are required to be transmitted to creditors and equity security holders under
this rule to reach the beneficial holders of securities held in nominee name. Such measures may include orders
directing the trustee or debtor in possession to reimburse the nominees out of the funds of the estate for the
expenses incurred by them in distributing materials to beneficial holders. In most cases, the plan proponent
will not know the identities of the beneficial holders and therefore it will be necessary to rely on the nominal
holders of the securities to distribute the plan materials to the beneficial owners.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1997 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to provide that it does not apply to the extent provided in new Rule 3017.1,
which applies in small business cases.
Subdivision (d) is amended to provide flexibility in fixing the record date for the purpose of determining the
holders of securities who are entitled to receive documents pursuant to this subdivision. For example, if there
may be a delay between the oral announcement of the judge's order approving the disclosure statement and
entry of the order on the court docket, the court may fix the date on which the judge orally approves the
disclosure statement as the record date so that the parties may expedite preparation of the lists necessary to
facilitate the distribution of the plan, disclosure statement, ballots, and other related documents.
The court may set a record date pursuant to subdivision (d) only after notice and a hearing as provided in
§102(1) of the Code. Notice of a request for an order fixing the record date may be included in the notice of
the hearing to consider approval of the disclosure statement mailed pursuant to Rule 2002(b).
If the court fixes a record date pursuant to subdivision (d) with respect to the holders of securities, and the
holders are impaired by the plan, the judge also should order that the same record date applies for the purpose
of determining eligibility for voting pursuant to Rule 3018(a).
Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.
GAP Report on Rule 3017. No changes to the published draft.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2001 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (f) is added to assure that entities whose conduct would be enjoined under a plan, rather than by
operation of the Code, and who will not receive the documents listed in subdivision (d) because they are
neither creditors nor equity security holders, are provided with adequate notice of the proposed injunction. It
does not address any substantive law issues relating to the validity or effect of any injunction provided under a
plan, or any due process or other constitutional issues relating to notice. These issues are beyond the scope of
these rules and are left for judicial determination.
This rule recognizes the need for adequate notice to subjects of an injunction, but that reasonable flexibility
under the circumstances may be required. If a known and identifiable entity would be subject to the
[Release Point 118-106]
injunction, and the notice, plan, and disclosure statement could be mailed to that entity, the court should
require that they be mailed at the same time that the plan, disclosure statement and related documents are
mailed to creditors under Rule 3017(d). If mailing notices and other documents is not feasible because the
entities subject to the injunction are described in the plan and disclosure statement by class or category and
they cannot be identified individually by name and address, the court may require that notice under Rule
3017(f)(1) be published.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made in the text of the proposed
amendments since publication. The Committee Note was revised to put in a more prominent position the
statement that the rule does not address related substantive law issues which are beyond the scope of the rules.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
1 So in original. The comma probably should not appear.
Rule 3017.1. Court Consideration of Disclosure Statement in a Small Business
Case or in a Case Under Subchapter V of Chapter 11
(a) CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF DISCLOSURE STATEMENT. In a small business case or
in a case under subchapter V of chapter 11 in which the court has ordered that §1125 applies, the
court may, on application of the plan proponent or on its own initiative, conditionally approve a
disclosure statement filed in accordance with Rule 3016. On or before conditional approval of the
disclosure statement, the court shall:
(1) fix a time within which the holders of claims and interests may accept or reject the plan;
(2) fix a time for filing objections to the disclosure statement;
(3) fix a date for the hearing on final approval of the disclosure statement to be held if a timely
objection is filed; and
(4) fix a date for the hearing on confirmation.
(b) APPLICATION OF RULE 3017. Rule 3017(a), (b), (c), and (e) do not apply to a conditionally
approved disclosure statement. Rule 3017(d) applies to a conditionally approved disclosure
statement, except that conditional approval is considered approval of the disclosure statement for the
purpose of applying Rule 3017(d).
(c) FINAL APPROVAL.
(1) Notice. Notice of the time fixed for filing objections and the hearing to consider final
approval of the disclosure statement shall be given in accordance with Rule 2002 and may be
combined with notice of the hearing on confirmation of the plan.
(2) Objections. Objections to the disclosure statement shall be filed, transmitted to the United
States trustee, and served on the debtor, the trustee, any committee appointed under the Code and
any other entity designated by the court at any time before final approval of the disclosure
statement or by an earlier date as the court may fix.
(3) Hearing. If a timely objection to the disclosure statement is filed, the court shall hold a
hearing to consider final approval before or combined with the hearing on confirmation of the
plan.

[Release Point 118-106]
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1997
This rule is added to implement §1125(f) that was added to the Code by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of
1994.
The procedures for electing to be considered a small business are set forth in Rule 1020. If the debtor is a
small business and has elected to be considered a small business, §1125(f) permits the court to conditionally
approve a disclosure statement subject to final approval after notice and a hearing. If a disclosure statement is
conditionally approved, and no timely objection to the disclosure statement is filed, it is not necessary for the
court to hold a hearing on final approval.
GAP Report on Rule 3017.1. No change to the published draft.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Section 101 of the Code, as amended in 2005, defines a "small business case" and "small business debtor,"
and eliminates any need to elect that status. Therefore, the reference in the rule to an election is deleted.
As provided in the amendment to Rule 3016(b), a plan intended to provide adequate information in a small
business case under §1125(f)(1) may be conditionally approved and is otherwise treated as a disclosure
statement under this rule.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended in response to the enactment of the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, Pub.
L. No. 116–54, 133 Stat. 1079. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to be a debtor
under subchapter V of chapter 11. The title and subdivision (a) of the rule are amended to cover such cases
when the court orders that §1125 of the Code applies.
Rule 3017.2. Fixing of Dates by the Court in Subchapter V Cases in Which There
Is No Disclosure Statement
In a case under subchapter V of chapter 11 in which §1125 does not apply, the court shall:
(a) fix a time within which the holders of claims and interests may accept or reject the plan;
(b) fix a date on which an equity security holder or creditor whose claim is based on a security
must be the holder of record of the security in order to be eligible to accept or reject the plan;
(c) fix a date for the hearing on confirmation; and
(d) fix a date for transmitting the plan, notice of the time within which the holders of claims and
interests may accept or reject it, and notice of the date for the hearing on confirmation.
(Added Apr. 11, 2022, eff. Dec. 1, 2022.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022
The rule is added in response to the enactment of the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, Pub. L.
No. 116–54, 133 Stat. 1079. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to be a debtor under
subchapter V of chapter 11. Because there generally will not be a disclosure statement in a subchapter V case,
see §1181(b) of the Code, the rule is added to authorize the court in such a case to act at a time other than
when a disclosure statement is approved to set certain times and dates.
Rule 3018. Acceptance or Rejection of Plan in a Chapter 9 Municipality or a
Chapter 11 Reorganization Case
(a) ENTITIES ENTITLED TO ACCEPT OR REJECT PLAN; TIME FOR ACCEPTANCE OR
REJECTION. A plan may be accepted or rejected in accordance with §1126 of the Code within the
time fixed by the court pursuant to Rule 3017, 3017.1, or 3017.2. Subject to subdivision (b) of this
rule, an equity security holder or creditor whose claim is based on a security of record shall not be
entitled to accept or reject a plan unless the equity security holder or creditor is the holder of record
of the security on the date the order approving the disclosure statement is entered or on another date
fixed by the court under Rule 3017.2, or fixed for cause after notice and a hearing. For cause shown,
the court after notice and hearing may permit a creditor or equity security holder to change or
[Release Point 118-106]
withdraw an acceptance or rejection. Notwithstanding objection to a claim or interest, the court after
notice and hearing may temporarily allow the claim or interest in an amount which the court deems
proper for the purpose of accepting or rejecting a plan.
(b) ACCEPTANCES OR REJECTIONS OBTAINED BEFORE PETITION. An equity security
holder or creditor whose claim is based on a security of record who accepted or rejected the plan
before the commencement of the case shall not be deemed to have accepted or rejected the plan
pursuant to §1126(b) of the Code unless the equity security holder or creditor was the holder of
record of the security on the date specified in the solicitation of such acceptance or rejection for the
purposes of such solicitation. A holder of a claim or interest who has accepted or rejected a plan
before the commencement of the case under the Code shall not be deemed to have accepted or
rejected the plan if the court finds after notice and hearing that the plan was not transmitted to
substantially all creditors and equity security holders of the same class, that an unreasonably short
time was prescribed for such creditors and equity security holders to accept or reject the plan, or that
the solicitation was not in compliance with §1126(b) of the Code.
(c) FORM OF ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION. An acceptance or rejection shall be in writing,
identify the plan or plans accepted or rejected, be signed by the creditor or equity security holder or
an authorized agent, and conform to the appropriate Official Form. If more than one plan is
transmitted pursuant to Rule 3017, an acceptance or rejection may be filed by each creditor or equity
security holder for any number of plans transmitted and if acceptances are filed for more than one
plan, the creditor or equity security holder may indicate a preference or preferences among the plans
so accepted.
(d) ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION BY PARTIALLY SECURED CREDITOR. A creditor
whose claim has been allowed in part as a secured claim and in part as an unsecured claim shall be
entitled to accept or reject a plan in both capacities.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule applies in chapter 9, 11 and 13 cases under the Code. The references in the rule to equity security
holders will not, however, be relevant in chapter 9 or 13 cases. The rule will be of little utility in a chapter 13
case because only secured creditors may be requested to vote on a plan; unsecured creditors are not entitled to
vote; see §1325(a)(4), (5) of the Code.
Subdivision (a) is derived from former Rule 10–305(a). It substitutes, in a reorganization case, entry of the
order approving the disclosure statement for the order approving a plan in conformity with the differences
between Chapter X and chapter 11. In keeping with the underlying theory it continues to recognize that the
lapse of time between the filing of the petition and entry of such order will normally be significant and, during
that interim, bonds and equity interests can change ownership.
Subdivision (b) recognizes the former Chapter XI practice permitting a plan and acceptances to be filed with
the petition, as does §1126(b) of the Code. However, because a plan under chapter 11 may affect shareholder
interests, there should be reference to a record date of ownership. In this instance the appropriate record date is
that used in the prepetition solicitation materials because it is those acceptances or rejections which are being
submitted to the court.
While §1126(c), (d), and (e) prohibits use of an acceptance or rejection not procured in good faith, the
added provision in subdivision (b) of the rule is somewhat more detailed. It would prohibit use of prepetition
acceptances or rejections when some but not all impaired creditors or equity security holders are solicited or
when they are not given a reasonable opportunity to submit their acceptances or rejections. This provision
together with §1126(e) gives the court the power to nullify abusive solicitation procedures.
Subdivision (c). It is possible that multiple plans may be before the court for confirmation. Pursuant to
§1129(c) of the Code, the court may confirm only one plan but is required to consider the preferences
expressed by those accepting the plans in determining which one to confirm.
Subdivisions (d) and (e) of former Rule 10–305 are not continued since comparable provisions are
contained in the statute; see §1126(c), (d), (e).
It should be noted that while the singular "plan" is used throughout, by construction the plural is included;
see §102(7).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
[Release Point 118-106]
Subdivisions (a) and (b) are amended to delete provisions that duplicate §1126 of the Code. An entity who
is not a record holder of a security, but who claims that it is entitled to be treated as a record holder, may file a
statement pursuant to Rule 3003(d).
Subdivision (a) is amended further to allow the court to permit a creditor or equity security holder to change
or withdraw an acceptance or rejection for cause shown whether or not the time fixed for voting has expired.
Subdivision (b) is also amended to give effect to a prepetition acceptance or rejection if solicitation
requirements were satisfied with respect to substantially all members of the same class, instead of requiring
proper solicitation with respect to substantially all members of all classes.
Subdivision (c) is amended to delete the Official Form number in anticipation of future revision and
renumbering of the Official Forms.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
The title of this rule is amended to indicate that it applies only in a chapter 9 or a chapter 11 case. The
amendment of the word "Plans" to "Plan" is stylistic.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1997 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to provide flexibility in fixing the record date for the purpose of determining the
holders of securities who are entitled to vote on the plan. For example, if there may be a delay between the
oral announcement of the judge's decision approving the disclosure statement and entry of the order on the
court docket, the court may fix the date on which the judge orally approves the disclosure statement as the
record date for voting purposes so that the parties may expedite preparation of the lists necessary to facilitate
the distribution of the plan, disclosure statement, ballots, and other related documents in connection with the
solicitation of votes.
The court may set a record date pursuant to subdivision (a) only after notice and a hearing as provided in
§102(1) of the Code. Notice of a request for an order fixing the record date may be included in the notice of
the hearing to consider approval of the disclosure statement mailed pursuant to Rule 2002(b).
If the court fixes the record date for voting purposes, the judge also should order that the same record date
shall apply for the purpose of distributing the documents required to be distributed pursuant to Rule 3017(d).
GAP Report on Rule 3018. No changes to the published draft.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) of the rule is amended to take account of the court's authority to set times under Rules
3017.1 and 3017.2 in small business cases and cases under subchapter V of chapter 11.
Rule 3019. Modification of Accepted Plan in a Chapter 9 Municipality or a
Chapter 11 Reorganization Case
(a) MODIFICATION OF PLAN BEFORE CONFIRMATION. In a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case,
after a plan has been accepted and before its confirmation, the proponent may file a modification of
the plan. If the court finds after hearing on notice to the trustee, any committee appointed under the
Code, and any other entity designated by the court that the proposed modification does not adversely
change the treatment of the claim of any creditor or the interest of any equity security holder who has
not accepted in writing the modification, it shall be deemed accepted by all creditors and equity
security holders who have previously accepted the plan.
(b) MODIFICATION OF PLAN AFTER CONFIRMATION IN INDIVIDUAL DEBTOR CASE.
If the debtor is an individual, a request to modify the plan under §1127(e) of the Code is governed by
Rule 9014. The request shall identify the proponent and shall be filed together with the proposed
modification. The clerk, or some other person as the court may direct, shall give the debtor, the
trustee, and all creditors not less than 21 days' notice by mail of the time fixed to file objections and,
if an objection is filed, the hearing to consider the proposed modification, unless the court orders
otherwise with respect to creditors who are not affected by the proposed modification. A copy of the
notice shall be transmitted to the United States trustee, together with a copy of the proposed
modification. Any objection to the proposed modification shall be filed and served on the debtor, the
proponent of the modification, the trustee, and any other entity designated by the court, and shall be
transmitted to the United States trustee.
(c) MODIFICATION OF PLAN AFTER CONFIRMATION IN A SUBCHAPTER V CASE. In a
[Release Point 118-106]
case under subchapter V of chapter 11, a request to modify the plan under §1193(b) or (c) of the
Code is governed by Rule 9014, and the provisions of this Rule 3019(b) apply.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Aug. 1, 1993; Apr. 23, 2008, eff.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule implements §§942, 1127 and 1323 of the Code. For example, §1127 provides for modification
before and after confirmation but does not deal with the minor modifications that do not adversely change any
rights. The rule makes clear that a modification may be made, after acceptance of the plan without submission
to creditors and equity security holders if their interests are not affected. To come within this rule, the
modification should be one that does not change the rights of a creditor or equity security holder as fixed in
the plan before modification.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to limit its application to chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. Modification of plans after
confirmation in chapter 12 and chapter 13 cases is governed by Rule 3015. The addition of the comma in the
second sentence is stylistic and makes no substantive change.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
The 2005 amendments to §1127 of the Code provide for modification of a confirmed plan in an individual
debtor chapter 11 case. Therefore, the rule is amended to establish the procedure for filing and objecting to a
proposed modification of a confirmed plan.
Changes Made After Publication. The last sentence of the published rule provided that an objection to
modification of a plan is governed by Rule 9014. The sentence is deleted and the reference to Rule 9014 is
moved to the first sentence of subdivision (b) of the rule. The Committee Note was revised to make the
reference to the 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code consistent with their identification in other
Committee Notes.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended in response to the enactment of the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, Pub.
L. No. 116–54, 133 Stat. 1079. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to be a debtor
under subchapter V of chapter 11. Subdivision (c) is added to the rule to govern requests to modify a plan
after confirmation in such cases under §1193(b) or (c) of the Code.
Rule 3020. Deposit; Confirmation of Plan in a Chapter 9 Municipality or
Chapter 11 Reorganization Case
(a) DEPOSIT. In a chapter 11 case, prior to entry of the order confirming the plan, the court may
order the deposit with the trustee or debtor in possession of the consideration required by the plan to
be distributed on confirmation. Any money deposited shall be kept in a special account established
for the exclusive purpose of making the distribution.
(b) OBJECTION TO AND HEARING ON CONFIRMATION IN A CHAPTER 9 OR CHAPTER
11 CASE.
(1) Objection. An objection to confirmation of the plan shall be filed and served on the debtor,
the trustee, the proponent of the plan, any committee appointed under the Code, and any other
[Release Point 118-106]
entity designated by the court, within a time fixed by the court. Unless the case is a chapter 9
municipality case, a copy of every objection to confirmation shall be transmitted by the objecting
party to the United States trustee within the time fixed for filing objections. An objection to
confirmation is governed by Rule 9014.
(2) Hearing. The court shall rule on confirmation of the plan after notice and hearing as
provided in Rule 2002. If no objection is timely filed, the court may determine that the plan has
been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law without receiving evidence on
such issues.
(c) ORDER OF CONFIRMATION.
(1) The order of confirmation shall conform to the appropriate Official Form. If the plan
provides for an injunction against conduct not otherwise enjoined under the Code, the order of
confirmation shall (1) describe in reasonable detail all acts enjoined; (2) be specific in its terms
regarding the injunction; and (3) identify the entities subject to the injunction.
(2) Notice of entry of the order of confirmation shall be mailed promptly to the debtor, the
trustee, creditors, equity security holders, other parties in interest, and, if known, to any identified
entity subject to an injunction provided for in the plan against conduct not otherwise enjoined
under the Code.
(3) Except in a chapter 9 municipality case, notice of entry of the order of confirmation shall be
transmitted to the United States trustee as provided in Rule 2002(k).
(d) RETAINED POWER. Notwithstanding the entry of the order of confirmation, the court may
issue any other order necessary to administer the estate.
(e) STAY OF CONFIRMATION ORDER. An order confirming a plan is stayed until the
expiration of 14 days after the entry of the order, unless the court orders otherwise.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is adapted from former Rules 10–307, 11–38, and 13–213. It applies to cases filed under chapters
9, 11 and 13. Certain subdivisions of the earlier rules have not been included, such as, a subdivision revesting
title in the debtor because §541 of the Code does not transfer title out of the debtor as did §70a of the
Bankruptcy Act; see also §§1141(b), 1327(b). Subdivision (b) of former Rule 13–213 is not included because
its provisions are contained in the statute; see §§1322, 1325(b), 105.
Subdivision (a) gives discretion to the court to require in chapter 11 cases the deposit of any consideration
to be distributed on confirmation. If money is to be distributed, it is to be deposited in a special account to
assure that it will not be used for any other purpose. The Code is silent in chapter 11 with respect to the need
to make a deposit or the person with whom any deposit is to be made. Consequently, there is no statutory
authority for any person to act in a capacity similar to the disbursing agent under former Chapter XI practice.
This rule provides that only the debtor in possession or trustee should be appointed as the recipient of the
deposit. Any consideration other than money, e.g., notes or stock may be given directly to the debtor in
possession or trustee and need not be left in any kind of special account. In chapter 9 cases, §944(b) provides
for deposit with a disbursing agent appointed by the court of any consideration to be distributed under the
plan.
Subdivision (d) clarifies the authority of the court to conclude matters pending before it prior to
confirmation and to continue to administer the estate as necessary, e.g., resolving objections to claims.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The United States trustee monitors chapter 11, chapter 12, and chapter 13 plans and has standing to be
heard regarding confirmation of a plan. See 28 U.S.C. §586(a)(3). The amendments to subdivisions (b)(1) and
(c) of this rule facilitate that role of the United States trustee. Subdivision (b)(1) is also amended to require
service on the proponent of the plan of objections to confirmation. The words "with the court" in subdivision
(b)(1) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
In a chapter 12 case, the court is required to conduct and conclude the hearing on confirmation of the plan
within the time prescribed in §1224 of the Code.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subdivision (c) is also amended to require that the confirmation order be mailed to the trustee. Reference to
the Official Form number is deleted in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to limit its application to chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. The procedures relating to
confirmation of plans in chapter 12 and chapter 13 cases are provided in Rule 3015. Other amendments are
stylistic and make no substantive change.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (e) is added to provide sufficient time for a party to request a stay pending appeal of an order
confirming a plan under chapter 9 or chapter 11 of the Code before the plan is implemented and an appeal
becomes moot. Unless the court orders otherwise, any transfer of assets, issuance of securities, and cash
distributions provided for in the plan may not be made before the expiration of the 10-day period. The stay of
the confirmation order under subdivision (e) does not affect the time for filing a notice of appeal from the
confirmation order in accordance with Rule 8002.
The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 3020(e) is not applicable so that the plan may be
implemented and distributions may be made immediately. Alternatively, the court may order that the stay
under Rule 3020(e) is for a fixed period less than 10 days.
GAP Report on Rule 3020. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2001 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c) is amended to provide notice to an entity subject to an injunction provided for in a plan
against conduct not otherwise enjoined by operation of the Code. This requirement is not applicable to an
injunction contained in a plan if it is substantially the same as an injunction provided under the Code. The
validity and effect of any injunction provided for in a plan are substantive law matters that are beyond the
scope of these rules.
The requirement that the order of confirmation identify the entities subject to the injunction requires only
reasonable identification under the circumstances. If the entities that would be subject to the injunction cannot
be identified by name, the order may describe them by class or category if reasonable under the
circumstances. For example, it may be sufficient to identify the entities as "all creditors of the debtor."
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made in the text of the proposed
amendments. The Committee Note was revised to put in a more prominent position the statement that the
validity and effect of injunctions provided for in plans is beyond the scope of the rules.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
Rule 3021. Distribution Under Plan
Except as provided in Rule 3020(e), after a plan is confirmed, distribution shall be made to
creditors whose claims have been allowed, to interest holders whose interests have not been
disallowed, and to indenture trustees who have filed claims under Rule 3003(c)(5) that have been
allowed. For purposes of this rule, creditors include holders of bonds, debentures, notes, and other
debt securities, and interest holders include the holders of stock and other equity securities, of record
at the time of commencement of distribution, unless a different time is fixed by the plan or the order
confirming the plan.
(As amended Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997; Apr. 26, 1999, eff. Dec. 1, 1999.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
[Release Point 118-106]
This rule is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10–405(a). Subdivision (b) of that rule is covered by
§1143 of the Code.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1997 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to provide flexibility in fixing the record date for the purpose of making distributions
to holders of securities of record. In a large case, it may be impractical for the debtor to determine the holders
of record with respect to publicly held securities and also to make distributions to those holders at the same
time. Under this amendment, the plan or the order confirming the plan may fix a record date for distributions
that is earlier than the date on which distributions commence.
This rule also is amended to treat holders of bonds, debentures, notes, and other debt securities the same as
any other creditors by providing that they shall receive a distribution only if their claims have been allowed.
Finally, the amendments clarify that distributions are to be made to all interest holders—not only those that
are within the definition of "equity security holders" under §101 of the Code—whose interests have not been
disallowed.
GAP Report on Rule 3021. No changes to the published draft.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
This amendment is to conform to the amendments to Rule 3020 regarding the ten-day stay of an order
confirming a plan in a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case. The other amendments are stylistic.
GAP Report on Rule 3021. No changes since publication.
Rule 3022. Final Decree in Chapter 11 Reorganization Case
After an estate is fully administered in a chapter 11 reorganization case, the court, on its own
motion or on motion of a party in interest, shall enter a final decree closing the case.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Section 350 of the Code requires the court to close the case after the estate is fully administered and the
trustee has been discharged. Section 1143 places a five year limitation on the surrender of securities when
required for participation under a plan but this provision should not delay entry of the final decree.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Entry of a final decree closing a chapter 11 case should not be delayed solely because the payments
required by the plan have not been completed. Factors that the court should consider in determining whether
the estate has been fully administered include (1) whether the order confirming the plan has become final, (2)
whether deposits required by the plan have been distributed, (3) whether the property proposed by the plan to
be transferred has been transferred, (4) whether the debtor or the successor of the debtor under the plan has
assumed the business or the management of the property dealt with by the plan, (5) whether payments under
the plan have commenced, and (6) whether all motions, contested matters, and adversary proceedings have
been finally resolved.
The court should not keep the case open only because of the possibility that the court's jurisdiction may be
invoked in the future. A final decree closing the case after the estate is fully administered does not deprive the
court of jurisdiction to enforce or interpret its own orders and does not prevent the court from reopening the
case for cause pursuant to §350(b) of the Code. For example, on motion of a party in interest, the court may
reopen the case to revoke an order of confirmation procured by fraud under §1144 of the Code. If the plan or
confirmation order provides that the case shall remain open until a certain date or event because of the
likelihood that the court's jurisdiction may be required for specific purposes prior thereto, the case should
remain open until that date or event.

use, sale, or lease of property pursuant to §363(e) may be granted without prior notice only if (A)
it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by a verified motion that immediate
and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party or the
attorney for the adverse party can be heard in opposition, and (B) the movant's attorney certifies to
the court in writing the efforts, if any, which have been made to give notice and the reasons why
notice should not be required. The party obtaining relief under this subdivision and §362(f) or
§363(e) shall immediately give oral notice thereof to the trustee or debtor in possession and to the
debtor and forthwith mail or otherwise transmit to such adverse party or parties a copy of the order
granting relief. On two days notice to the party who obtained relief from the stay without notice or
on shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe, the adverse party may appear and move
reinstatement of the stay or reconsideration of the order prohibiting or conditioning the use, sale,
or lease of property. In that event, the court shall proceed expeditiously to hear and determine the
motion.
(3) Stay of Order. An order granting a motion for relief from an automatic stay made in

included on the list filed under Rule 1007(d); and (3) any other entity that the court directs.
(2) Hearing. The court may commence a final hearing on a motion for authorization to use cash
collateral no earlier than 14 days after service of the motion. If the motion so requests, the court
may conduct a preliminary hearing before such 14-day period expires, but the court may authorize
[Release Point 118-106]
the use of only that amount of cash collateral as is necessary to avoid immediate and irreparable
harm to the estate pending a final hearing.

default, liens, borrowing limits, and borrowing conditions. If the proposed credit agreement or
form of order includes any of the provisions listed below, the concise statement shall also:
briefly list or summarize each one; identify its specific location in the proposed agreement and
form of order; and identify any such provision that is proposed to remain in effect if interim

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule implements §362 of the Code which set forth provisions regarding the automatic stay that arises
on the filing of a petition. That section and this rule are applicable in chapters 7, 9, 11 and 13 cases. It also
implements §363(c)(2) concerning use of cash collateral.
Subdivision (a) transforms with respect to the automatic stay what was an adversary proceeding under the
former rules to motion practice. The Code provides automatic stays in several sections, e.g., §§362(a),
1301(a), and in §362(d) provides some grounds for relief from the stay. This rule specifies that the pleading
seeking relief is by means of a motion. Thus the time period in Rule 7012 to answer a complaint would not be
applicable and shorter periods may be fixed. Section 362(e) requires the preliminary hearing to be concluded
within 30 days of it inception, rendering ordinary complaint and answer practice inappropriate.
This subdivision also makes clear that a motion under Rule 9014 is the proper procedure for a debtor to
seek court permission to use cash collateral. See §363(c)(2). Pursuant to Rule 5005, the motion should be filed
in the court in which the case in pending. The court or local rule may specify the persons to be served with the
motion for relief from the stay; see Rule 9013.
Subdivision (b) of the rule fills a procedural void left by §362. Pursuant to §362(e), the automatic stay is
terminated 30 days after a motion for relief is made unless the court continues the stay as a result of a final
hearing or, pending final hearing, after a preliminary hearing. If a preliminary hearing is held, §362(e) requires
the final hearing to be commenced within 30 days after the preliminary hearing. Although the expressed
legislative intent is to require expeditious resolution of a secured party's motion for relief, §362 is silent as to
the time within which the final hearing must be concluded. Subdivision (b) imposes a 30 day deadline on the
court to resolve the dispute.
At the final hearing, the stay is to be terminated, modified, annulled, or conditioned for cause, which
includes, inter alia, lack of adequate protection; §362(d). The burden of proving adequate protection is on the
party opposing relief from the stay; §362(g)(2). Adequate protection is exemplified in §361.
Subdivision (c) implements §362(f) which permits ex parte relief from the stay when there will be
irreparable damage. This subdivision sets forth the procedure to be followed when relief is sought under
§362(f). It is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 601(d).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
The scope of this rule is expanded and the former subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) are now combined in
subdivision (a). The new subdivision (a)(2) is amended to conform to the 1984 amendments to §362(e) of the
Code.
Subdivision (b) deals explicitly with the procedures which follow after a motion to use cash collateral is
made and served. Filing shall be pursuant to Rule 5005. Service of the motion may be made by any method
authorized by Rule 7004 and, if service is by mail, service is complete on mailing. Rule 9006(e). Under
subdivision (b)(2), the court may commence a final hearing on the motion within 15 days of service. Rule
9006(f) does not extend this 15 day period when service of the motion is by mail because the party served is
not required to act within the 15 day period. In addition to service of the motion, notice of the hearing must be
given. Rule 9007 authorizes the court to direct the form and manner of giving notice that is appropriate to the
circumstances.
Section 363(c)(3) authorizes the court to conduct a preliminary hearing and to authorize the use of cash
collateral "if there is a reasonable likelihood that the trustee will prevail at a final hearing." Subdivision (b)(2)
of the rule permits a preliminary hearing to be held earlier than 15 days after service. Any order authorizing
the use of cash collateral shall be limited to the amount necessary to protect the estate until a final hearing is
held.
The objective of subdivision (b) is to accommodate both the immediate need of the debtor and the interest
of the secured creditor in the cash collateral. The time for holding the final hearing may be enlarged beyond
the 15 days prescribed when required by the circumstances.
The motion for authority to use cash collateral shall include (1) the amount of cash collateral sought to be
used; (2) the name and address of each entity having an interest in the cash collateral; (3) the name and
address of the entity in control or having possession of the cash collateral; (4) the facts demonstrating the need
to use the cash collateral; and (5) the nature of the protection to be provided those having an interest in the
cash collateral. If a preliminary hearing is requested, the motion shall also include the amount of cash
collateral sought to be used pending final hearing and the protection to be provided.
Notice of the preliminary and final hearings may be combined. This rule does not limit the authority of the
court under §363(c)(2)(B) and §102(1).
[Release Point 118-106]
Subdivision (c) is new. The service, hearing, and notice requirements are similar to those imposed by
subdivision (b). The motion to obtain credit shall include the amount and type of the credit to be extended, the
name and address of the lender, the terms of the agreement, the need to obtain the credit, and the efforts made
to obtain credit from other sources. If the motion is to obtain credit pursuant to §364(c) or (d), the motion shall
describe the collateral, if any, and the protection for any existing interest in the collateral which may be
affected by the proposed agreement.
Subdivision (d) is new. In the event the 15 day period for filing objections to the approval of an agreement
of the parties described in this subdivision is too long, the parties either may move for a reduction of the
period under Rule 9006(c)(1) or proceed under subdivision (b) or (c), if applicable. Rule 9006(c)(1) requires
that cause be shown for the reduction of the period in which to object. In applying this criterion the court may
consider the option of proceeding under subdivision (b) or (c) and grant a preliminary hearing and relief
pending final hearing.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is expanded to include a request to prohibit or condition the use, sale, or lease of property as
is necessary to provide adequate protection of a property interest pursuant to §363(e) of the Code.
Notice of the motion for relief from the automatic stay or to prohibit or condition the use, sale, or lease of
property must be served on the entities entitled to receive notice of a motion to approve an agreement pursuant
to subdivision (d). If the movant and the adverse party agree to settle the motion and the terms of the
agreement do not materially differ from the terms set forth in the movant's motion papers, the court may
approve the agreement without further notice pursuant to subdivision (d)(4).
Subdivision (a)(2) is deleted as unnecessary because of §362(e) of the Code.
Subdivisions (b)(1), (c)(1), and (d)(1) are amended to require service on committees that are elected in
chapter 7 cases. Service on committees of retired employees appointed under §1114 of the Code is not
required. These subdivisions are amended further to clarify that, in the absence of a creditors' committee,
service on the creditors included on the list filed pursuant to Rule 1007(d) is required only in chapter 9 and
chapter 11 cases. The other amendments to subdivision (d)(1) are for consistency of style and are not
substantive.
Subdivision (d)(4) is added to avoid the necessity of further notice and delay for the approval of an
agreement in settlement of a motion for relief from an automatic stay, to prohibit or condition the use, sale, or
lease of property, for use of cash collateral, or for authority to obtain credit if the entities entitled to notice
have already received sufficient notice of the scope of the proposed agreement in the motion papers and have
had an opportunity to be heard. For example, if a trustee makes a motion to use cash collateral and proposes in
the original motion papers to provide adequate protection of the interest of the secured party by granting a lien
on certain equipment, and the secured creditor subsequently agrees to terms that are within the scope of those
proposed in the motion, the court may enter an order approving the agreement without further notice if the
entities that received the original motion papers have had a reasonable opportunity to object to the granting of
the motion to use cash collateral.
If the motion papers served under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) do not afford notice sufficient to inform the
recipients of the material provisions of the proposed agreement and opportunity for a hearing, approval of the
settlement agreement may not be obtained unless the procedural requirements of subdivision (d)(1), (d)(2),
and (d)(3) are satisfied. If the 15 day period for filing objections to the approval of the settlement agreement is
too long under the particular circumstances of the case, the court may shorten the time for cause under Rule
9006(c)(1).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
Paragraph (a)(3) is added to provide sufficient time for a party to request a stay pending appeal of an order
granting relief from an automatic stay before the order is enforced or implemented. The stay under paragraph
(a)(3) is not applicable to orders granted ex parte in accordance with Rule 4001(a)(2).
The stay of the order does not affect the time for filing a notice of appeal in accordance with Rule 8002.
While the enforcement and implementation of an order granting relief from the automatic stay is temporarily
stayed under paragraph (a)(3), the automatic stay continues to protect the debtor, and the moving party may
not foreclose on collateral or take any other steps that would violate the automatic stay.
The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 4001(a)(3) is not applicable so that the prevailing party may
immediately enforce and implement the order granting relief from the automatic stay. Alternatively, the court
may order that the stay under Rule 4001(a)(3) is for a fixed period less than 10 days.
GAP Report on Rule 4001. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2007 AMENDMENT
[Release Point 118-106]
The rule is amended to require that parties seeking authority to use cash collateral, to obtain credit, and to
obtain approval of agreements to provide adequate protection, modify or terminate the stay, or to grant a
senior or equal lien on property, submit with those requests a proposed order granting the relief, and that they
provide more extensive notice to interested parties of a number of specified terms. The motion must either not
exceed five pages in length, or, if it is longer, begin with a concise statement of five pages or less, that
summarizes or lists the material provisions and which will assist the court and interested parties in
understanding the nature of the relief requested. The concise statement must also set out the location within
the documents of the summarized or listed provisions. The parties to agreements and lending offers frequently
have concise summaries of their transactions that contain a list of the material provisions of the agreements,
even if the agreements themselves are very lengthy. A similar summary should allow the court and interested
parties to understand the relief requested.
In addition to the concise statement, the rule requires that motions under subdivisions (c) and (d) state
whether the movant is seeking approval of any of the provisions listed in subdivision (c)(1)(B), and where
those provisions are located in the documents. The rule is intended to enhance the ability of the court and
interested parties to find and evaluate those provisions.
The rule also provides that any motion for authority to obtain credit must identify any provision listed in
subdivision (c)(1)(B)(i)–(xi) that is proposed to remain effective if the court grants the motion on an interim
basis under Rule 4001(c)(2), but later denies final relief.
Other amendments are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication.
1. The introductory language in subdivisions (b)(1)(B), (c)(1)(B), and (d)(1)(B) was revised to clarify
that the motions filed under the rule can be either no more than five pages long or begin with a concise
statement of that length. This permits the continued use of forms that have been effective in smaller cases.
Subdivision (c)(1)(B) also is amended to require that the motion identify any provisionally approved term
that would remain in effect even if the court denies the permanent relief requested.
2. A new subparagraph (c)(1)(B)(vi) was inserted into the rule and the remaining subparagraphs were
renumbered accordingly. The new subparagraph requires that the motion identify any provisions setting
deadlines for filing and confirming reorganization plans and disclosure statements.
3. Subdivisions (c)(1)(C) and (d)(1)(C) of the proposed rule were deleted as unnecessary. The court
has whatever authority Rule 9024 provides, and making an explicit reference to that rule in these
subdivisions brings unnecessary attention to Rule 9024 and could create a different standard of review
under that rule than would apply in other instances. The Advisory Committee did not intend either
consequence, so the subdivisions were deleted.
4. Subdivision (d)(1)(A) was restyled to form a vertical list of the motions subject to that provision.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2010 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (d). Subdivision (d) is amended to implement changes in connection with the 2009 amendment
to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in subdivision
(d)(2) and (d)(3) are amended to substitute deadlines that are multiples of seven days. Throughout the rules,
deadlines have been amended in the following manner:
• 5 day periods become 7 day periods
• 10 day periods become 14 day periods
• 15 day periods become 14 day periods
• 20 day periods become 21 day periods
• 25 day periods become 28 day periods
Final approval of the amendments to this rule is sought without publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2019 AMENDMENT
[Release Point 118-106]
Subdivision (c) of the rule is amended to exclude chapter 13 cases from that subdivision. This amendment
does not speak to the underlying substantive issue of whether the Bankruptcy Code requires or permits a
chapter 13 debtor not engaged in business to request approval of postpetition credit.
1 So in original. Probably should be only one section symbol.
Rule 4002. Duties of Debtor
(a) IN GENERAL. In addition to performing other duties prescribed by the Code and rules, the
debtor shall:
(1) attend and submit to an examination at the times ordered by the court;
(2) attend the hearing on a complaint objecting to discharge and testify, if called as a witness;
(3) inform the trustee immediately in writing as to the location of real property in which the
debtor has an interest and the name and address of every person holding money or property
subject to the debtor's withdrawal or order if a schedule of property has not yet been filed pursuant
to Rule 1007;
(4) cooperate with the trustee in the preparation of an inventory, the examination of proofs of
claim, and the administration of the estate; and
(5) file a statement of any change of the debtor's address.
(b) INDIVIDUAL DEBTOR'S DUTY TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION.
(1) Personal Identification. Every individual debtor shall bring to the meeting of creditors under
§341:
(A) a picture identification issued by a governmental unit, or other personal identifying
information that establishes the debtor's identity; and
(B) evidence of social-security number(s), or a written statement that such documentation
does not exist.
(2) Financial Information. Every individual debtor shall bring to the meeting of creditors under
§341, and make available to the trustee, the following documents or copies of them, or provide a
written statement that the documentation does not exist or is not in the debtor's possession:
(A) evidence of current income such as the most recent payment advice;
(B) unless the trustee or the United States trustee instructs otherwise, statements for each of
the debtor's depository and investment accounts, including checking, savings, and money
market accounts, mutual funds and brokerage accounts for the time period that includes the date
of the filing of the petition; and
(C) documentation of monthly expenses claimed by the debtor if required by §707(b)(2)(A)
or (B).
(3) Tax Return. At least 7 days before the first date set for the meeting of creditors under §341,
the debtor shall provide to the trustee a copy of the debtor's federal income tax return for the most
recent tax year ending immediately before the commencement of the case and for which a return
was filed, including any attachments, or a transcript of the tax return, or provide a written
statement that the documentation does not exist.
(4) Tax Returns Provided to Creditors. If a creditor, at least 14 days before the first date set for
the meeting of creditors under §341, requests a copy of the debtor's tax return that is to be
provided to the trustee under subdivision (b)(3), the debtor, at least 7 days before the first date set
for the meeting of creditors under §341, shall provide to the requesting creditor a copy of the
return, including any attachments, or a transcript of the tax return, or provide a written statement
that the documentation does not exist.
(5) Confidentiality of Tax Information. The debtor's obligation to provide tax returns under Rule
4002(b)(3) and (b)(4) is subject to procedures for safeguarding the confidentiality of tax
information established by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule should be read together with §§343 and 521 of the Code and Rule 1007, all of which impose
duties on the debtor. Clause (3) of this rule implements the provisions of Rule 2015(a).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
New clause (5) of the rule imposes on the debtor the duty to advise the clerk of any change of the debtor's
address.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to implement §521(a)(1)(B)(iv) and (e)(2), added to the Code by the 2005
amendments. These Code amendments expressly require the debtor to file with the court, or provide to the
trustee, specific documents. The amendments to the rule implement these obligations and establish a time
frame for creditors to make requests for a copy of the debtor's Federal income tax return. The rule also
requires the debtor to provide documentation in support of claimed expenses under §707(b)(2)(A) and (B).
Subdivision (b) of the rule is also amended to require the debtor to cooperate with the trustee by providing
materials and documents necessary to assist the trustee in the performance of the trustee's duties. Nothing in
the rule, however, is intended to limit or restrict the debtor's duties under §521, or to limit the access of the
Attorney General to any information provided by the debtor in the case. Subdivision (b)(2) does not require
that the debtor create documents or obtain documents from third parties; rather, the debtor's obligation is to
bring to the meeting of creditors under §341 the documents which the debtor possesses. Under subdivision
(b)(2)(B), the trustee or the United States trustee can instruct debtors that they need not provide the documents
described in that subdivision. Under subdivisions (b)(3) and (b)(4), the debtor must obtain and provide copies
of tax returns or tax transcripts to the appropriate person, unless no such documents exist. Any written
statement that the debtor provides indicating either that documents do not exist or are not in the debtor's
possession must be verified or contain an unsworn declaration as required under Rule 1008.
Because the amendment implements the debtor's duty to cooperate with the trustee, the materials provided
to the trustee would not be made available to any other party in interest at the §341 meeting of creditors other
than the Attorney General. Some of the documents may contain otherwise private information that should not
be disseminated. For example, pay stubs and financial account statements might include the social-security
numbers of the debtor and the debtor's spouse and dependents, as well as the names of the debtor's children.
The debtor should redact all but the last four digits of all social-security numbers and the names of any minors
when they appear in these documents. This type of information would not usually be needed by creditors and
others who may be attending the meeting. If a creditor perceives a need to review specific documents or other
evidence, the creditor may proceed under Rule 2004.
Tax information produced under this rule is subject to procedures for safeguarding confidentiality
established by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
Changes Made After Publication. The second paragraph of the Committee Note was amended to clarify that
the debtor's duty to provide copies of tax returns or tax transcripts are governed by a different standard than
the debtor's duty to provide other financial information.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
Rule 4003. Exemptions
(a) CLAIM OF EXEMPTIONS. A debtor shall list the property claimed as exempt under §522 of
the Code on the schedule of assets required to be filed by Rule 1007. If the debtor fails to claim
[Release Point 118-106]
exemptions or file the schedule within the time specified in Rule 1007, a dependent of the debtor
may file the list within 30 days thereafter.
(b) OBJECTING TO A CLAIM OF EXEMPTIONS.
(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a party in interest may file an objection to the
list of property claimed as exempt within 30 days after the meeting of creditors held under §341(a)
is concluded or within 30 days after any amendment to the list or supplemental schedules is filed,
whichever is later. The court may, for cause, extend the time for filing objections if, before the
time to object expires, a party in interest files a request for an extension.
(2) The trustee may file an objection to a claim of exemption at any time prior to one year after
the closing of the case if the debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption. The trustee shall
deliver or mail the objection to the debtor and the debtor's attorney, and to any person filing the
list of exempt property and that person's attorney.
(3) An objection to a claim of exemption based on §522(q) shall be filed before the closing of
the case. If an exemption is first claimed after a case is reopened, an objection shall be filed before
the reopened case is closed.
(4) A copy of any objection shall be delivered or mailed to the trustee, the debtor and the
debtor's attorney, and the person filing the list and that person's attorney.
(c) BURDEN OF PROOF. In any hearing under this rule, the objecting party has the burden of
proving that the exemptions are not properly claimed. After hearing on notice, the court shall
determine the issues presented by the objections.
(d) AVOIDANCE BY DEBTOR OF TRANSFERS OF EXEMPT PROPERTY. A proceeding
under §522(f) to avoid a lien or other transfer of property exempt under the Code shall be
commenced by motion in the manner provided by Rule 9014, or by serving a chapter 12 or chapter
13 plan on the affected creditors in the manner provided by Rule 7004 for service of a summons and
complaint. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (b), a creditor may object to a request
under §522(f) by challenging the validity of the exemption asserted to be impaired by the lien.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 17, 2000, eff.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from §522(1) of the Code and, in part, former Bankruptcy Rule 403. The Code changes
the thrust of that rule by making it the burden of the debtor to list his exemptions and the burden of parties in
interest to raise objections in the absence of which "the property claimed as exempt on such list is exempt;"
§522(1).
Subdivision (a). While §522(1) refers to a list of property claimed as exempt, the rule incorporates such a
list as part of Official Form No. 6, the schedule of the debtor's assets, rather than requiring a separate list and
filing. Rule 1007, to which subdivision (a) refers, requires that schedule to be filed within 15 days after the
order for relief, unless the court extends the time.
Section 522(1) also provides that a dependent of the debtor may file the list if the debtor fails to do so.
Subdivision (a) of the rule allows such filing from the expiration of the debtor's time until 30 days thereafter.
Dependent is defined in §522(a)(1).
Subdivision (d) provides that a proceeding by the debtor, permitted by §522(f) of the Code, is a contested
matter rather than the more formal adversary proceeding. Proceedings within the scope of this subdivision are
distinguished from proceedings brought by the trustee to avoid transfers. The latter are classified as adversary
proceedings by Rule 7001.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is amended to facilitate the filing of objections to exemptions claimed on a supplemental
schedule filed under Rule 1007(h).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2000 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to permit the court to grant a timely request for an extension of time to file objections
to the list of claimed exemptions, whether the court rules on the request before or after the expiration of the
30-day period. The purpose of this amendment is to avoid the harshness of the present rule which has been
construed to deprive a bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to grant a timely request for an extension if it has failed
[Release Point 118-106]
to rule on the request within the 30-day period. See In re Laurain, 113 F.3d 595 (6th Cir. 1997), Matter of
Stoulig, 45 F.3d 957 (5th Cir. 1995), In re Brayshaw, 912 F.2d 1255 (10th Cir. 1990). The amendments clarify
that the extension may be granted only for cause. The amendments also conform the rule to §522(l) of the
Code by recognizing that any party in interest may file an objection or request for an extension of time under
this rule. Other amendments are stylistic.
GAP Report on Rule 4003(b). The words "trustee or creditor" were replaced by "party in interest" to
conform to §522(l) of the Bankruptcy Code which permits any party in interest to object to claimed
exemptions. Style revisions also were made to the published draft.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is rewritten to include four paragraphs.
Subdivision (b)(2) is added to the rule to permit the trustee to object to an exemption at any time up to one
year after the closing of the case if the debtor fraudulently claimed the exemption. Extending the deadline for
trustees to object to an exemption when the exemption claim has been fraudulently made will permit the court
to review and, in proper circumstances, deny improperly claimed exemptions, thereby protecting the
legitimate interests of creditors and the bankruptcy estate. However, similar to the deadline set in §727(e) of
the Code for revoking a discharge which was fraudulently obtained, an objection to an exemption that was
fraudulently claimed must be filed within one year after the closing of the case. Subdivision (b)(2) extends the
objection deadline only for trustees.
Subdivision (b)(3) is added to the rule to reflect the addition of subsection (q) to §522 of the Code by the
2005 Act. Section 522(q) imposes a $136,875 limit on a state homestead exemption if the debtor has been
convicted of a felony or owes a debt arising from certain causes of action. Other revised provisions of the
Code, such as §727(a)(12) and §1328(h), suggest that the court may consider issues relating to §522(q) late in
the case, and the 30-day period for objections would not be appropriate for this provision.
Subdivision (d) is amended to clarify that a creditor with a lien on property that the debtor is attempting to
avoid on the grounds that the lien impairs an exemption may raise in defense to the lien avoidance action any
objection to the debtor's claimed exemption. The right to object is limited to an objection to the exemption of
the property subject to the lien and for purposes of the lien avoidance action only. The creditor may not object
to other exemption claims made by the debtor. Those objections, if any, are governed by Rule 4003(b).
Other changes are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication. The deadline for filing objections to exemptions under subdivision (b)(1)
was returned to 30 days after the conclusion of the §341 meeting of creditors rather than the 60 day period
proposed in the published rule. The second paragraph of the Committee Note which discussed this change was
therefore deleted. Subdivisions (b)(2) and (b)(3) were amended to add the debtor and the debtor's attorney to
the list of persons to whom objections to exemptions must be delivered.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2017 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (d) is amended to provide that a request under §522(f) to avoid a lien or other transfer of
exempt property may be made by motion or by a chapter 12 or chapter 13 plan. A plan that proposes lien
avoidance in accordance with this rule must be served as provided under Rule 7004 for service of a summons
and complaint. Lien avoidance not governed by this rule requires an adversary proceeding.
Rule 4004. Grant or Denial of Discharge
(a) TIME FOR OBJECTING TO DISCHARGE; NOTICE OF TIME FIXED. In a chapter 7 case,
a complaint, or a motion under §727(a)(8) or (a)(9) of the Code, objecting to the debtor's discharge
shall be filed no later than 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under §341(a).
In a chapter 11 case, the complaint shall be filed no later than the first date set for the hearing on
confirmation. In a chapter 13 case, a motion objecting to the debtor's discharge under §1328(f) shall
be filed no later than 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under §341(a). At
least 28 days' notice of the time so fixed shall be given to the United States trustee and all creditors
as provided in Rule 2002(f) and (k) and to the trustee and the trustee's attorney.
(b) EXTENSION OF TIME.
(1) On motion of any party in interest, after notice and hearing, the court may for cause extend
the time to object to discharge. Except as provided in subdivision (b)(2), the motion shall be filed
before the time has expired.
(2) A motion to extend the time to object to discharge may be filed after the time for objection
[Release Point 118-106]
has expired and before discharge is granted if (A) the objection is based on facts that, if learned
after the discharge, would provide a basis for revocation under §727(d) of the Code, and (B) the
movant did not have knowledge of those facts in time to permit an objection. The motion shall be
filed promptly after the movant discovers the facts on which the objection is based.
(c) GRANT OF DISCHARGE.
(1) In a chapter 7 case, on expiration of the times fixed for objecting to discharge and for filing
a motion to dismiss the case under Rule 1017(e), the court shall forthwith grant the discharge,
except that the court shall not grant the discharge if:
(A) the debtor is not an individual;
(B) a complaint, or a motion under §727(a)(8) or (a)(9), objecting to the discharge has been
filed and not decided in the debtor's favor;
(C) the debtor has filed a waiver under §727(a)(10);
(D) a motion to dismiss the case under §707 is pending;
(E) a motion to extend the time for filing a complaint objecting to the discharge is pending;
(F) a motion to extend the time for filing a motion to dismiss the case under Rule 1017(e)(1)
is pending;
(G) the debtor has not paid in full the filing fee prescribed by 28 U.S.C. §1930(a) and any
other fee prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States under 28 U.S.C. §1930(b)
that is payable to the clerk upon the commencement of a case under the Code, unless the court
has waived the fees under 28 U.S.C. §1930(f);
(H) the debtor has not filed with the court a statement of completion of a course concerning
personal financial management if required by Rule 1007(b)(7);
(I) a motion to delay or postpone discharge under §727(a)(12) is pending;
(J) a motion to enlarge the time to file a reaffirmation agreement under Rule 4008(a) is
pending;
(K) a presumption is in effect under §524(m) that a reaffirmation agreement is an undue
hardship and the court has not concluded a hearing on the presumption; or
(L) a motion is pending to delay discharge because the debtor has not filed with the court all
tax documents required to be filed under §521(f).
(2) Notwithstanding Rule 4004(c)(1), on motion of the debtor, the court may defer the entry of
an order granting a discharge for 30 days and, on motion within that period, the court may defer
entry of the order to a date certain.
(3) If the debtor is required to file a statement under Rule 1007(b)(8), the court shall not grant a
discharge earlier than 30 days after the statement is filed.
(4) In a chapter 11 case in which the debtor is an individual, or a chapter 13 case, the court shall
not grant a discharge if the debtor has not filed any statement required by Rule 1007(b)(7).
(d) APPLICABILITY OF RULES IN PART VII AND RULE 9014. An objection to discharge is
governed by Part VII of these rules, except that an objection to discharge under §§727(a)(8),1 (a)(9),
or 1328(f) is commenced by motion and governed by Rule 9014.
(e) ORDER OF DISCHARGE. An order of discharge shall conform to the appropriate Official
Form.
(f) REGISTRATION IN OTHER DISTRICTS. An order of discharge that has become final may
be registered in any other district by filing a certified copy of the order in the office of the clerk of
that district. When so registered the order of discharge shall have the same effect as an order of the
court of the district where registered.
(g) NOTICE OF DISCHARGE. The clerk shall promptly mail a copy of the final order of
discharge to those specified in subdivision (a) of this rule.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 404.
Subdivisions (a) and (b) of this rule prescribe the procedure for determining whether a discharge will be
granted pursuant to §727 of the Code. The time fixed by subdivision (a) may be enlarged as provided in
subdivision (b).
The notice referred to in subdivision (a) is required to be given by mail and addressed to creditors as
provided in Rule 2002.
An extension granted on a motion pursuant to subdivision (b) of the rule would ordinarily benefit only the
movant, but its scope and effect would depend on the terms of the extension.
Subdivision (c). If a complaint objecting to discharge is filed, the court's grant or denial of the discharge
will be entered at the conclusion of the proceeding as a judgment in accordance with Rule 9021. The inclusion
of the clause in subdivision (c) qualifying the duty of the court to grant a discharge when a waiver has been
filed is in accord with the construction of the Code. 4 Collier, Bankruptcy 727.12 (15th ed. 1979).
The last sentence of subdivision (c) takes cognizance of §524(c) of the Code which authorizes a debtor to
enter into enforceable reaffirmation agreements only prior to entry of the order of discharge. Immediate entry
of that order after expiration of the time fixed for filing complaints objecting to discharge may render it more
difficult for a debtor to settle pending litigation to determine the dischargeability of a debt and execute a
reaffirmation agreement as part of a settlement.
Subdivision (d). An objection to discharge is required to be made by a complaint, which initiates an
adversary proceeding as provided in Rule 7003. Pursuant to Rule 5005, the complaint should be filed in the
court in which the case is pending.
Subdivision (e). Official Form No. 27 to which subdivision (e) refers, includes notice of the effects of a
discharge specified in §524(a) of the Code.
Subdivision (f). Registration may facilitate the enforcement of the order of discharge in a district other than
that in which it was entered. See 2 Moore's Federal Practice 1.04[2] (2d ed. 1967). Because of the
nationwide service of process authorized by Rule 7004, however, registration of the order of discharge is not
necessary under these rules to enable a discharged debtor to obtain relief against a creditor proceeding
anywhere in the United States in disregard of the injunctive provisions of the order of discharge.
Subdivision (g). Notice of discharge should be mailed promptly after the order becomes final so that
creditors may be informed of entry of the order and of its injunctive provisions. Rule 2002 specifies the
manner of the notice and persons to whom the notice is to be given.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to conform to §727(c) which gives the United States trustee the right to object to
discharge. This amendment is derived from Rule X–1008(a)(1) and is consistent with Rule 2002. The
amendment to subdivision (c) is to prevent a timely motion to dismiss a chapter 7 case for substantial abuse
from becoming moot merely because a discharge order has been entered. Reference to the Official Form
number in subdivision (e) is deleted in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1996 AMENDMENT
Subsection (c) is amended to delay entry of the order of discharge if a motion pursuant to Rule 4004(b) to
extend the time for filing a complaint objecting to discharge is pending. Also, this subdivision is amended to
delay entry of the discharge order if the debtor has not paid in full the filing fee and the administrative fee
required to be paid upon the commencement of the case. If the debtor is authorized to pay the fees in
installments in accordance with Rule 1006, the discharge order will not be entered until the final installment
has been paid.
The other amendments to this rule are stylistic.
GAP Report on Rule 4004. No changes have been made since publication, except for stylistic changes.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to clarify that, in a chapter 7 case, the deadline for filing a complaint objecting
to discharge under §727(a) is 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors, whether or not the
meeting is held on that date. The time for filing the complaint is not affected by any delay in the
commencement or conclusion of the meeting of creditors. This amendment does not affect the right of any
party in interest to file a motion for an extension of time to file a complaint objecting to discharge in
accordance with Rule 4004(b).
The substitution of the word "filed" for "made" in subdivision (b) is intended to avoid confusion regarding
[Release Point 118-106]
the time when a motion is "made" for the purpose of applying these rules. See, e.g., In re Coggin, 30 F.3d
1443 (11th Cir. 1994). As amended, this rule requires that a motion for an extension of time for filing a
complaint objecting to discharge be filed before the time has expired.
Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.
GAP Report on Rule 4004. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2000 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c) is amended so that a discharge will not be granted while a motion requesting an extension of
time to file a motion to dismiss the case under §707(b) is pending. Other amendments are stylistic.
GAP Report on Rule 4004(c). No changes since publication except for style revisions.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2002 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c)(1)(D) is amended to provide that the filing of a motion to dismiss under §707 of the
Bankruptcy Code postpones the entry of the discharge. Under the present version of the rule, only motions to
dismiss brought under §707(b) cause the postponement of the discharge. This amendment would change the
result in cases such as In re Tanenbaum, 210 B.R. 182 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1997).
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c)(1)(G) is amended to reflect the fee waiver provision in 28 U.S.C. §1930, added by the 2005
amendments.
Subdivision (c)(1)(H) is new. It reflects the 2005 addition to the Code of §§727(a)(11) and 1328(g), which
require that individual debtors complete a course in personal financial management as a condition to the entry
of a discharge. Including this requirement in the rule helps prevent the inadvertent entry of a discharge when
the debtor has not complied with this requirement. If a debtor fails to file the required statement regarding a
personal financial management course, the clerk will close the bankruptcy case without the entry of a
discharge.
Subdivision (c)(1)(I) is new. It reflects the 2005 addition to the Code of §727(a)(12). This provision is
linked to §522(q). Section 522(q) limits the availability of the homestead exemption for individuals who have
been convicted of a felony or who owe a debt arising from certain causes of action within a particular time
frame. The existence of reasonable cause to believe that §522(q) may be applicable to the debtor constitutes
grounds for withholding the discharge.
Subdivision (c)(1)(J) is new. It accommodates the deadline for filing a reaffirmation agreement established
by Rule 4008(a).
Subdivision (c)(1)(K) is new. It reflects the 2005 revisions to §524 of the Code that alter the requirements
for approval of reaffirmation agreements. Section 524(m) sets forth circumstances under which a reaffirmation
agreement is presumed to be an undue hardship. This triggers an obligation to review the presumption and
may require notice and a hearing. Subdivision (c)(1)(J) has been added to prevent the discharge from being
entered until the court approves or disapproves the reaffirmation agreement in accordance with §524(m).
Subdivision (c)(1)(L) is new. It implements §1228(a) of Public Law Number 109–8, an uncodified
provision of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which prohibits entry of
a discharge unless required tax documents have been provided to the court.
Subdivision (c)(3) is new. It postpones the entry of the discharge of an individual debtor in a case under
chapter 11, 12, or 13 if there is a question as to the applicability of §522(q) of the Code. The postponement
provides an opportunity for a creditor to file a motion to limit the debtor's exemption under that provision.
Other changes are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
[Release Point 118-106]
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2010 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) is amended to include a deadline for filing a motion objecting to a debtor's
discharge under §§727(a)(8), [sic] (a)(9), or 1328(f) of the Code. These sections establish time limits on the
issuance of discharges in successive bankruptcy cases by the same debtor.
Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c)(1) is amended because a corresponding amendment to subdivision (d)
directs certain objections to discharge to be brought by motion rather than by complaint. Subparagraph
(c)(1)(B) directs the court not to grant a discharge if a motion or complaint objecting to discharge has been
filed unless the objection has been decided in the debtor's favor.
Subdivision (c)(4) is new. It directs the court in chapter 11 and 13 cases to withhold the entry of the
discharge if an individual debtor has not filed a statement of completion of a course concerning personal
financial management as required by Rule 1007(b)(7).
Subdivision (d). Subdivision (d) is amended to direct that objections to discharge under §§727(a)(8), (a)(9),
and 1328(f) be commenced by motion rather than by complaint. Objections under the specified provisions are
contested matters governed by Rule 9014. The title of the subdivision is also amended to reflect this change.
Changes Made After Publication. Subdivision (d) was amended to provide that objections to discharge
under §§727(a)(8), (a)(9), and 1328(f) are commenced by motion rather than by complaint and are governed
by Rule 9014. Because of the relocation of this provision from the previously proposed Rule 7001(b),
subdivisions (a) and (c)(1) of this rule were revised to change references to "motion under Rule 7001(b)" to
"motion under §727(a)(8) or (a)(9)." Other stylistic changes were made to the rule, and the Committee Note
was revised to reflect these changes.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2011 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) is amended to allow a party, under certain specified circumstances, to seek
an extension of time to object to discharge after the time for filing has expired. This amendment addresses the
situation in which there is a gap between the expiration of the time for objecting to discharge and the entry of
the discharge order. If, during that period, a party discovers facts that would provide grounds for revocation of
discharge, it may not be able to seek revocation under §727(d) of the Code because the facts would have been
known prior to the granting of the discharge. Furthermore, during that period the debtor may commit an act
that provides a basis for both denial and revocation of the discharge. In those situations, subdivision (b)(2)
allows a party to file a motion for an extension of time to object to discharge based on those facts so long as
they were not known to the party before expiration of the deadline for objecting. The motion must be filed
promptly after discovery of those facts.
Changes Made After Publication. Following publication minor stylistic changes were made to the language
of the rule, and a sentence was added to the Committee Note to clarify that the rule applies whenever the
debtor commits an act during the gap period that provides a basis for both denial and revocation of the
discharge.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2013 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c)(1) is amended in several respects. The introductory language of paragraph (1) is revised to
emphasize that the listed circumstances do not just relieve the court of the obligation to enter the discharge
promptly but that they prevent the court from entering a discharge.
Subdivision (c)(1)(H) is amended to reflect the simultaneous amendment of Rule 1007(b)(7). The
amendment of the latter rule relieves a debtor of the obligation to file a statement of completion of a course
concerning personal financial management if the course provider notifies the court directly that the debtor has
completed the course. Subparagraph (H) now requires postponement of the discharge when a debtor fails to
file a statement of course completion only if the debtor has an obligation to file the statement.
Subdivision (c)(1)(K) is amended to make clear that the prohibition on entering a discharge due to a
presumption of undue hardship under §524(m) of the Code ceases when the presumption expires or the court
concludes a hearing on the presumption.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Because this amendment is being made to conform to a
simultaneous amendment of Rule 1007(b)(7) and is otherwise technical in nature, final approval is sought
without publication.
1 So in original. Probably should be only one section symbol.
Rule 4005. Burden of Proof in Objecting to Discharge
[Release Point 118-106]
At the trial on a complaint objecting to a discharge, the plaintiff has the burden of proving the
objection.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule does not address the burden of going forward with the evidence. Subject to the allocation by the
rule of the initial burden of producing evidence and the ultimate burden of persuasion, the rule leaves to the
courts the formulation of rules governing the shift of the burden of going forward with the evidence in the
light of considerations such as the difficulty of proving the nonexistence of a fact and of establishing a fact as
to which the evidence is likely to be more accessible to the debtor than to the objector. See, e.g., In re
Haggerty, 165 F.2d 977, 979–80 (2d Cir. 1948); Federal Provision Co. v. Ershowsky, 94 F.2d 574, 575 (2d
Cir. 1938); In re Riceputo, 41 F. Supp. 926, 927–28 (E.D.N.Y. 1941).
Rule 4006. Notice of No Discharge
If an order is entered: denying a discharge; revoking a discharge; approving a waiver of discharge;
or, in the case of an individual debtor, closing the case without the entry of a discharge, the clerk
shall promptly notify all parties in interest in the manner provided by Rule 2002.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
The suspension by §108(c) of the Code of the statute of limitations affecting any debt of a debtor terminates
within 30 days after the debtor is denied a discharge or otherwise loses his right to a discharge. If, however, a
debtor's failure to receive a discharge does not come to the attention of his creditors until after the statutes of
limitations have run, the debtor obtains substantially the same benefits from his bankruptcy as a debtor who is
discharged.
This rule requires the clerk to notify creditors if a debtor fails to obtain a discharge because a waiver of
discharge was filed under §727(a)(10) or as a result of an order denying or revoking the discharge under
§727(a) or (d).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
This amendment was necessary because the 2005 amendments to the Code require that individual debtors in
a chapter 7 or 13 case complete a course in personal financial management as a condition to the entry of a
discharge. If the debtor fails to complete the course, the case may be closed and no discharge will be entered.
Reopening the case is governed by §350 and Rule 5010. The rule is amended to provide notice to parties in
interest, including the debtor, that no discharge was entered.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
Rule 4007. Determination of Dischargeability of a Debt
(a) PERSONS ENTITLED TO FILE COMPLAINT. A debtor or any creditor may file a complaint
to obtain a determination of the dischargeability of any debt.
(b) TIME FOR COMMENCING PROCEEDING OTHER THAN UNDER §523(c) OF THE
CODE. A complaint other than under §523(c) may be filed at any time. A case may be reopened
without payment of an additional filing fee for the purpose of filing a complaint to obtain a
determination under this rule.
(c) TIME FOR FILING COMPLAINT UNDER §523(c) IN A CHAPTER 7 LIQUIDATION,
CHAPTER 11 REORGANIZATION, CHAPTER 12 FAMILY FARMER'S DEBT ADJUSTMENT
CASE, OR CHAPTER 13 INDIVIDUAL'S DEBT ADJUSTMENT CASE; NOTICE OF TIME
FIXED. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (d), a complaint to determine the
dischargeability of a debt under §523(c) shall be filed no later than 60 days after the first date set for
the meeting of creditors under §341(a). The court shall give all creditors no less than 30 days' notice
[Release Point 118-106]
of the time so fixed in the manner provided in Rule 2002. On motion of a party in interest, after
hearing on notice, the court may for cause extend the time fixed under this subdivision. The motion
shall be filed before the time has expired.
(d) TIME FOR FILING COMPLAINT UNDER §523(a)(6) IN A CHAPTER 13 INDIVIDUAL'S
DEBT ADJUSTMENT CASE; NOTICE OF TIME FIXED. On motion by a debtor for a discharge
under §1328(b), the court shall enter an order fixing the time to file a complaint to determine the
dischargeability of any debt under §523(a)(6) and shall give no less than 30 days' notice of the time
fixed to all creditors in the manner provided in Rule 2002. On motion of any party in interest, after
hearing on notice, the court may for cause extend the time fixed under this subdivision. The motion
shall be filed before the time has expired.
(e) APPLICABILITY OF RULES IN PART VII. A proceeding commenced by a complaint filed
under this rule is governed by Part VII of these rules.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 26, 1999, eff.
Dec. 1, 1999; Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule prescribes the procedure to be followed when a party requests the court to determine
dischargeability of a debt pursuant to §523 of the Code.
Although a complaint that comes within §523(c) must ordinarily be filed before determining whether the
debtor will be discharged, the court need not determine the issues presented by the complaint filed under this
rule until the question of discharge has been determined under Rule 4004. A complaint filed under this rule
initiates an adversary proceeding as provided in Rule 7003.
Subdivision (b) does not contain a time limit for filing a complaint to determine the dischargeability of a
type of debt listed as nondischargeable under §523(a)(1), (3), (5), (7), (8), or (9). Jurisdiction over this issue
on these debts is held concurrently by the bankruptcy court and any appropriate nonbankruptcy forum.
Subdivision (c) differs from subdivision (b) by imposing a deadline for filing complaints to determine the
issue of dischargeability of debts set out in §523(a)(2), (4) or (6) of the Code. The bankruptcy court has
exclusive jurisdiction to determine dischargeability of these debts. If a complaint is not timely filed, the debt is
discharged. See §523(c).
Subdivision (e). The complaint required by this subdivision should be filed in the court in which the case is
pending pursuant to Rule 5005.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to delete the words "with the court" as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and
9001(3).
Subdivision (c) is amended to apply in chapter 12 cases the same time period that applies in chapter 7 and
11 cases for filing a complaint under §523(c) of the Code to determine dischargeability of certain debts. Under
§1228(a) of the Code, a chapter 12 discharge does not discharge the debts specified in §523(a) of the Code.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c) is amended to clarify that the deadline for filing a complaint to determine the
dischargeability of a debt under §523(c) of the Code is 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of
creditors, whether or not the meeting is held on that date. The time for filing the complaint is not affected by
any delay in the commencement or conclusion of the meeting of creditors. This amendment does not affect the
right of any party in interest to file a motion for an extension of time to file a complaint to determine the
dischargeability of a debt in accordance with this rule.
The substitution of the word "filed" for "made" in the final sentences of subdivisions (c) and (d) is intended
to avoid confusion regarding the time when a motion is "made" for the purpose of applying these rules. See,
e.g., In re Coggin, 30 F.3d 1443 (11th Cir. 1994). As amended, these subdivisions require that a motion for an
extension of time be filed before the time has expired.
The other amendments to this rule are stylistic.
GAP Report on Rule 4007. No changes since publication, except for stylistic changes in the heading of Rule
4007(d).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c) is amended because of the 2005 amendments to §1328(a) of the Code. This revision
expands the exceptions to discharge upon completion of a chapter 13 plan. Subdivision (c) extends to chapter
[Release Point 118-106]
13 the same time limits applicable to other chapters of the Code with respect to the two exceptions to
discharge that have been added to §1328(a) and that are within §523(c).
The amendment to subdivision (d) reflects the 2005 amendments to §1328(a) that expands the exceptions to
discharge upon completion of a chapter 13 plan, including two out of three of the provisions that fall within
§523(c). However, the 2005 revisions to §1328(a) do not include a reference to §523(a)(6), which is the third
provision to which §523(c) refers. Thus, subdivision (d) is now limited to that provision.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
Rule 4008. Filing of Reaffirmation Agreement; Statement in Support of
Reaffirmation Agreement
(a) FILING OF REAFFIRMATION AGREEMENT. A reaffirmation agreement shall be filed no
later than 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under §341(a) of the Code. The
reaffirmation agreement shall be accompanied by a cover sheet, prepared as prescribed by the
appropriate Official Form. The court may, at any time and in its discretion, enlarge the time to file a
reaffirmation agreement.
(b) STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF REAFFIRMATION AGREEMENT. The debtor's statement
required under §524(k)(6)(A) of the Code shall be accompanied by a statement of the total income
and expenses stated on schedules I and J. If there is a difference between the total income and
expenses stated on those schedules and the statement required under §524(k)(6)(A), the statement
required by this subdivision shall include an explanation of the difference.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; Mar. 26, 2009, eff.
Dec. 1, 2009.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Section 524(d) of the Code requires the court to hold a hearing to inform an individual debtor concerning
the granting or denial of discharge and the law applicable to reaffirmation agreements.
The notice of the §524(d) hearing may be combined with the notice of the meeting of creditors or entered as
a separate order.
The expression "not more than" contained in the first sentence of the rule is for the explicit purpose of
requiring the hearing to occur within that time period and cannot be extended.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is changed to conform to §524(d) of the Code as amended in 1986. A hearing under §524(d) is not
mandatory unless the debtor desires to enter into a reaffirmation agreement.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to establish a deadline for filing reaffirmation agreements. The Code sets out a number
of prerequisites to the enforceability of reaffirmation agreements. Among those requirements, §524(k)(6)(A)
provides that each reaffirmation agreement must be accompanied by a statement indicating the debtor's ability
to make the payments called for by the agreement. In the event that this statement reflects an insufficient
income to allow payment of the reaffirmed debt, §524(m) provides that a presumption of undue hardship
arises, allowing the court to disapprove the reaffirmation agreement, but only after a hearing conducted prior
to the entry of discharge. Rule 4004(c)(1)(K) accommodates this provision by delaying the entry of discharge
where a presumption of undue hardship arises. However, in order for that rule to be effective, the
reaffirmation agreement itself must be filed before the entry of discharge. Under Rule 4004(c)(1) discharge is
to be entered promptly after the expiration of the time for filing a complaint objecting to discharge, which,
under Rule 4004(a), is 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under §341(a). Accordingly,
that date is set as the deadline for filing a reaffirmation agreement.
Any party may file the agreement with the court. Thus, whichever party has a greater incentive to enforce
the agreement usually will file it. In the event that the parties are unable to file a reaffirmation agreement in a
timely fashion, the rule grants the court broad discretion to permit a late filing. A corresponding change to
Rule 4004(c)(1)(J) accommodates such an extension by providing for a delay in the entry of discharge during
the pendency of a motion to extend the time for filing a reaffirmation agreement.
Rule 4008 is also amended by deleting provisions regarding the timing of any reaffirmation and discharge
hearing. As noted above, §524(m) itself requires that hearings on undue hardship be conducted prior to the

entry of discharge. In other respects, including hearings to approve reaffirmation agreements of unrepresented
debtors under §524(c)(6), the rule leaves discretion to the court to set the hearing at a time appropriate for the
particular circumstances presented in the case and consistent with the scheduling needs of the parties.
Changes Made After Publication. The only change was stylistic. The phrase "of the Code" was added to
subdivision (b).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) of the rule is amended to require that the entity filing the reaffirmation agreement with the
court also include Official Form 27, the Reaffirmation Agreement Cover Sheet. The form includes
information necessary for the court to determine whether the proposed reaffirmation agreement is presumed to
be an undue hardship for the debtor under §524(m) of the Code.

PART V—COURTS AND CLERKS
Rule 5001. Courts and Clerks' Offices
(a) COURTS ALWAYS OPEN. The courts shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing
any pleading or other proper paper, issuing and returning process, and filing, making, or entering
motions, orders and rules.
(b) TRIALS AND HEARINGS; ORDERS IN CHAMBERS. All trials and hearings shall be
conducted in open court and so far as convenient in a regular court room. Except as otherwise
provided in 28 U.S.C. §152(c), all other acts or proceedings may be done or conducted by a judge in
chambers and at any place either within or without the district; but no hearing, other than one ex
parte, shall be conducted outside the district without the consent of all parties affected thereby.
(c) CLERK'S OFFICE. The clerk's office with the clerk or a deputy in attendance shall be open
during business hours on all days except Saturdays, Sundays and the legal holidays listed in Rule
9006(a).

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is adapted from subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of Rule 77 F.R.Civ.P.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Rule 9001, as amended, defines court to mean the bankruptcy judge or district judge before whom a case or
proceeding is pending. Clerk means the bankruptcy clerk, if one has been appointed for the district; if a
bankruptcy clerk has not been appointed, clerk means clerk of the district court.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c) is amended to refer to Rule 9006(a) for a list of legal holidays. Reference to F.R.Civ.P. is
not necessary for this purpose.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to permit bankruptcy judges to hold hearings outside of the district in which the case is
pending to the extent that the circumstances lead to the authorization of the court to take such action under the
2005 amendment to 28 U.S.C. §152(c). Under that provision, bankruptcy judges may hold court outside of
their districts in emergency situations and when the business of the court otherwise so requires. This
amendment to the rule is intended to implement the legislation.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
Rule 5002. Restrictions on Approval of Appointments
[Release Point 118-106]
(a) APPROVAL OF APPOINTMENT OF RELATIVES PROHIBITED. The appointment of an
individual as a trustee or examiner pursuant to §1104 of the Code shall not be approved by the court
if the individual is a relative of the bankruptcy judge approving the appointment or the United States
trustee in the region in which the case is pending. The employment of an individual as an attorney,
accountant, appraiser, auctioneer, or other professional person pursuant to §§327, 1103, or 1114 shall
not be approved by the court if the individual is a relative of the bankruptcy judge approving the
employment. The employment of an individual as attorney, accountant, appraiser, auctioneer, or
other professional person pursuant to §§327, 1103, or 1114 may be approved by the court if the
individual is a relative of the United States trustee in the region in which the case is pending, unless
the court finds that the relationship with the United States trustee renders the employment improper
under the circumstances of the case. Whenever under this subdivision an individual may not be
approved for appointment or employment, the individual's firm, partnership, corporation, or any
other form of business association or relationship, and all members, associates and professional
employees thereof also may not be approved for appointment or employment.
(b) JUDICIAL DETERMINATION THAT APPROVAL OF APPOINTMENT OR
EMPLOYMENT IS IMPROPER. A bankruptcy judge may not approve the appointment of a person
as a trustee or examiner pursuant to §1104 of the Code or approve the employment of a person as an
attorney, accountant, appraiser, auctioneer, or other professional person pursuant to §§327, 1103, or
1114 of the Code if that person is or has been so connected with such judge or the United States
trustee as to render the appointment or employment improper.
(As amended Apr. 29, 1985, eff. Aug. 1, 1985; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 505(a). The scope of the prohibition on appointment or
employment is expanded to include an examiner appointed under §1104 of the Code and attorneys and other
professional persons whose employment must be approved by the court under §327 or §1103.
The rule supplements two statutory provisions. Under 18 U.S.C. §1910, it is a criminal offense for a judge
to appoint a relative as a trustee and, under 28 U.S.C. §458, a person may not be "appointed to or employed in
any office or duty in any court" if he is a relative of any judge of that court. The rule prohibits the appointment
or employment of a relative of a bankruptcy judge in a case pending before that bankruptcy judge or before
other bankruptcy judges sitting within the district.
A relative is defined in §101(34) of the Code to be an "individual related by affinity or consanguinity within
the third degree as determined by the common law, or individual in a step or adoptive relationship within such
third degree." Persons within the third degree under the common law system are as follows: first
degree—parents, brothers and sisters, and children; second degree—grandparents, uncles and aunts, first
cousins, nephews and nieces, and grandchildren; third degree—great grandparents, great uncles and aunts,
first cousins once removed, second cousins, grand nephews and nieces, great grandchildren. Rule 9001
incorporates the definitions of §101 of the Code.
In order for the policy of this rule to be meaningfully implemented, it is necessary to extend the prohibition
against appointment or employment to the firm or other business association of the ineligible person and to
those affiliated with the firm or business association. "Firm" is defined in Rule 9001 to include a professional
partnership or corporation of attorneys or accountants. All other types of business and professional
associations and relationships are covered by this rule.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1985 AMENDMENT
The amended rule is divided into two subdivisions. Subdivision (a) applies to relatives of bankruptcy judges
and subdivision (b) applies to persons who are or have been connected with bankruptcy judges. Subdivision
(a) permits no judicial discretion; subdivision (b) allows judicial discretion. In both subdivisions of the
amended rule "bankruptcy judge" has been substituted for "judge". The amended rule makes clear that it only
applies to relatives of, or persons connected with, the bankruptcy judge. See In re Hilltop Sand and Gravel,
Inc., 35 B.R. 412 (N.D. Ohio 1983).
Subdivision (a). The original rule prohibited all bankruptcy judges in a district from appointing or
approving the employment of (i) a relative of any bankruptcy judge serving in the district, (ii) the firm or
business association of any ineligible relative and (iii) any member or professional employee of the firm or
business association of an ineligible relative. In addition, the definition of relative, the third degree
relationship under the common law, is quite broad. The restriction on the employment opportunities of
[Release Point 118-106]
relatives of bankruptcy judges was magnified by the fact that many law and accounting firms have practices
and offices spanning the nation.
Relatives are not eligible for appointment or employment when the bankruptcy judge to whom they are
related makes the appointment or approves the employment. Canon 3(b)(4) of the Code of Judicial Conduct,
which provides that the judge "shall exercise his power of appointment only on the basis of merit, avoiding
nepotism and favoritism," should guide a bankruptcy judge when a relative of a judge of the same bankruptcy
court is considered for appointment or employment.
Subdivision (b), derived from clause (2) of the original rule, makes a person ineligible for appointment or
employment if the person is so connected with a bankruptcy judge making the appointment or approving the
employment as to render the appointment or approval of employment improper. The caption and text of the
subdivision emphasize that application of the connection test is committed to the sound discretion of the
bankruptcy judge who is to make the appointment or approve the employment. All relevant circumstances are
to be taken into account by the court. The most important of those circumstances include: the nature and
duration of the connection with the bankruptcy judge; whether the connection still exists, and, if not, when it
was terminated; and the type of appointment or employment. These and other considerations must be carefully
evaluated by the bankruptcy judge.
The policy underlying subdivision (b) is essentially the same as the policy embodied in the Code of Judicial
Conduct. Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct instructs a judge to avoid impropriety and the appearance
of impropriety, and Canon 3(b)(4) provides that the judge "should exercise his power of appointment only on
the basis of merit, avoiding nepotism and favoritism." Subdivision (b) alerts the potential appointee or
employee and party seeking approval of employment to consider the possible relevance or impact of
subdivision (b) and indicates to them that appropriate disclosure must be made to the bankruptcy court before
accepting appointment or employment. The information required may be made a part of the application for
approval of employment. See Rule 2014(a).
Subdivision (b) departs from the former rule in an important respect: a firm or business association is not
prohibited from appointment or employment merely because an individual member or employee of the firm or
business association is ineligible under subdivision (b).
The emphasis given to the bankruptcy court's judicial discretion in applying subdivision (b) and the absence
of a per se extension of ineligibility to the firm or business association or any ineligible individual
complement the amendments to subdivision (a). The change is intended to moderate the prior limitation on the
employment opportunities of attorneys, accountants and other professional persons who are or who have been
connected in some way with the bankruptcy judge. For example, in all but the most unusual situations service
as a law clerk to a bankruptcy judge is not the type of connection which alone precludes appointment or
employment. Even if a bankruptcy judge determines that it is improper to appoint or approve the employment
of a former law clerk in the period immediately after completion of the former law clerk's service with the
judge, the firm which employs the former law clerk will, absent other circumstances, be eligible for
employment. In each instance all the facts must be considered by the bankruptcy judge.
Subdivision (b) applies to persons connected with a bankruptcy judge. "Person" is defined in §101 of the
Bankruptcy Code to include an "individual, partnership and corporation". A partnership or corporation may be
appointed or employed to serve in a bankruptcy case. If a bankruptcy judge is connected in some way with a
partnership or corporation, it is necessary for the court to determine whether the appointment or employment
of that partnership or corporation is proper.
The amended rule does not regulate professional relationships which do not require approval of a
bankruptcy judge. Disqualification of the bankruptcy judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §455 may, however, be
appropriate. Under Rule 5004(a), a bankruptcy judge may find that disqualification from only some aspect of
the case, rather than the entire case, is necessary. A situation may also arise in which the disqualifying
circumstance only comes to light after services have been performed. Rule 5004(b) provides that if
compensation from the estate is sought for these services, the bankruptcy judge is disqualified from awarding
compensation.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The 1986 amendments to the Code provide that the United States trustee shall appoint trustees in chapter 7,
chapter 12, and chapter 13 cases without the necessity of court approval. This rule is not intended to apply to
the appointment of trustees in those cases because it would be inappropriate for a court rule to restrict in
advance the exercise of discretion by the executive branch. See Committee Note to Rule 2009.
In chapter 11 cases, a trustee or examiner is appointed by the United States trustee after consultation with
parties in interest and subject to court approval. Subdivision (a), as amended, prohibits the approval of the
appointment of an individual as a trustee or examiner if the person is a relative of the United States trustee
[Release Point 118-106]
making the appointment or the bankruptcy judge approving the appointment.
The United States trustee neither appoints nor approves the employment of professional persons employed
pursuant to §§327, 1103, or 1114 of the Code. Therefore, subdivision (a) is not a prohibition against judicial
approval of employment of a professional person who is a relative of the United States trustee. However, the
United States trustee monitors applications for compensation and reimbursement of expenses and may raise,
appear and be heard on issues in the case. Employment of relatives of the United States trustee may be
approved unless the court finds, after considering the relationship and the particular circumstances of the case,
that the relationship would cause the employment to be improper. As used in this rule, "improper" includes the
appearance of impropriety.
United States trustee is defined to include a designee or assistant United States trustee. See Rule 9001.
Therefore, subdivision (a) is applicable if the person appointed as trustee or examiner or the professional to be
employed is a relative of a designee of the United States trustee or any assistant United States trustee in the
region in which the case is pending.
This rule is not exclusive of other laws or rules regulating ethical conduct. See, e.g., 28 CFR §45.735–5.
Rule 5003. Records Kept By the Clerk
(a) BANKRUPTCY DOCKETS. The clerk shall keep a docket in each case under the Code and
shall enter thereon each judgment, order, and activity in that case as prescribed by the Director of the
Administrative Office of the United States Courts. The entry of a judgment or order in a docket shall
show the date the entry is made.
(b) CLAIMS REGISTER. The clerk shall keep in a claims register a list of claims filed in a case
when it appears that there will be a distribution to unsecured creditors.
(c) JUDGMENTS AND ORDERS. The clerk shall keep, in the form and manner as the Director
of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts may prescribe, a correct copy of every final
judgment or order affecting title to or lien on real property or for the recovery of money or property,
and any other order which the court may direct to be kept. On request of the prevailing party, a
correct copy of every judgment or order affecting title to or lien upon real or personal property or for
the recovery of money or property shall be kept and indexed with the civil judgments of the district
court.
(d) INDEX OF CASES; CERTIFICATE OF SEARCH. The clerk shall keep indices of all cases
and adversary proceedings as prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts. On request, the clerk shall make a search of any index and papers in the clerk's
custody and certify whether a case or proceeding has been filed in or transferred to the court or if a
discharge has been entered in its records.
(e) REGISTER OF MAILING ADDRESSES OF FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTAL
UNITS AND CERTAIN TAXING AUTHORITIES. The United States or the state or territory in
which the court is located may file a statement designating its mailing address. The United States,
state, territory, or local governmental unit responsible for collecting taxes within the district in which
the case is pending may also file a statement designating an address for service of requests under
§505(b) of the Code, and the designation shall describe where further information concerning
additional requirements for filing such requests may be found. The clerk shall keep, in the form and
manner as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts may prescribe, a
register that includes the mailing addresses designated under the first sentence of this subdivision,
and a separate register of the addresses designated for the service of requests under §505(b) of the
Code. The clerk is not required to include in any single register more than one mailing address for
each department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or the state or territory. If more than
one address for a department, agency, or instrumentality is included in the register, the clerk shall
also include information that would enable a user of the register to determine the circumstances
when each address is applicable, and mailing notice to only one applicable address is sufficient to
provide effective notice. The clerk shall update the register annually, effective January 2 of each
year. The mailing address in the register is conclusively presumed to be a proper address for the
governmental unit, but the failure to use that mailing address does not invalidate any notice that is
otherwise effective under applicable law.
[Release Point 118-106]
(f) OTHER BOOKS AND RECORDS OF THE CLERK. The clerk shall keep any other books
and records required by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec. 1, 2000; Apr. 23, 2008, eff.
Dec. 1, 2008.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule consolidates former Bankruptcy Rules 504 and 507. The record-keeping duties of the referee
under former Bankruptcy Rule 504 are transferred to the clerk. Subdivisions (a), (c), (d) and (e) are similar to
subdivisions (a)–(d) of Rule 79 F.R.Civ.P.
Subdivision (b) requires that filed claims be listed on a claims register only when there may be a distribution
to unsecured creditors. Compilation of the list for no asset or nominal asset cases would serve no purpose.
Rule 2013 requires the clerk to maintain a public record of fees paid from the estate and an annual summary
thereof.
Former Bankruptcy Rules 507(d) and 508, which made materials in the clerk's office and files available to
the public, are not necessary because §107 of the Code guarantees public access to files and dockets of cases
under the Code.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) has been made more specific.
Subdivision (c) is amended to require that on the request of the prevailing party the clerk of the district court
shall keep and index bankruptcy judgments and orders affecting title to or lien upon real or personal property
or for the recovery of money or property with the civil judgments of the district court. This requirement is
derived from former Rule 9021(b). The Director of the Administrative Office will provide guidance to the
bankruptcy and district court clerks regarding appropriate paperwork and retention procedures.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2000 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (e) is added to provide a source where debtors, their attorneys, and other parties may go to
determine whether the United States or the state or territory in which the court is located has filed a statement
designating a mailing address for notice purposes. By using the address in the register—which must be
available to the public—the sender is assured that the mailing address is proper. But the use of an address that
differs from the address included in the register does not invalidate the notice if it is otherwise effective under
applicable law.
The register may include a separate mailing address for each department, agency, or instrumentality of the
United States or the state or territory. This rule does not require that addresses of municipalities or other local
governmental units be included in the register, but the clerk may include them.
Although it is important for the register to be kept current, debtors, their attorneys, and other parties should
be able to rely on mailing addresses listed in the register without the need to continuously inquire as to new or
amended addresses. Therefore, the clerk must update the register, but only once each year.
To avoid unnecessary cost and burden on the clerk and to keep the register a reasonable length, the clerk is
not required to include more than one mailing address for a particular agency, department, or instrumentality
of the United States or the state or territory. But if more than one address is included, the clerk is required to
include information so that a person using the register could determine when each address should be used. In
any event, the inclusion of more than one address for a particular department, agency, or instrumentality does
not impose on a person sending a notice the duty to send it to more than one address.
GAP Report on Rule 5003. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement §505(b)(1) of the Code added by the 2005 amendments, which allows a
taxing authority to designate an address to use for the service of requests under that subsection. Under the
amendment, the clerk is directed to maintain a separate register for mailing addresses of governmental units
solely for the service of requests under §505(b). This register is in addition to the register of addresses of
governmental units already maintained by the clerk. The clerk is required to keep only one address for a
governmental unit in each register.
Changes Made After Publication. Subdivision (e) was amended to clarify that the clerk must maintain a
separate mailing address register that contains the addresses to which notices pertaining to actions under §505
of the Code are to be sent.
[Release Point 118-106]
Rule 5004. Disqualification
(a) DISQUALIFICATION OF JUDGE. A bankruptcy judge shall be governed by 28 U.S.C. §455,
and disqualified from presiding over the proceeding or contested matter in which the disqualifying
circumstances 1 arises or, if appropriate, shall be disqualified from presiding over the case.
(b) DISQUALIFICATION OF JUDGE FROM ALLOWING COMPENSATION. A bankruptcy
judge shall be disqualified from allowing compensation to a person who is a relative of the
bankruptcy judge or with whom the judge is so connected as to render it improper for the judge to
authorize such compensation.
(As amended Apr. 29, 1985, eff. Aug. 1, 1985; Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a). Disqualification of a bankruptcy judge is governed by 28 U.S.C. §455. That section
provides that the judge "shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably
be questioned" or under certain other circumstances. In a case under the Code it is possible that the
disqualifying circumstance will be isolated to an adversary proceeding or contested matter. The rule makes it
clear that when the disqualifying circumstance is limited in that way the judge need only disqualify himself
from presiding over that adversary proceeding or contested matter.
It is possible, however, that even if the disqualifying circumstance arises in connection with an adversary
proceeding, the effect will be so pervasive that disqualification from presiding over the case is appropriate.
This distinction is consistent with the definition of "proceeding" in 28 U.S.C. §455(d)(1).
Subdivision (b) precludes a bankruptcy judge from allowing compensation from the estate to a relative or
other person closely associated with the judge. The subdivision applies where the judge has not appointed or
approved the employment of the person requesting compensation. Perhaps the most frequent application of the
subdivision will be in the allowance of administrative expenses under §503(b)(3)–(5) of the Code. For
example, if an attorney or accountant is retained by an indenture trustee who thereafter makes a substantial
contribution in a chapter 11 case, the attorney or accountant may seek compensation under §503(b)(4). If the
attorney or accountant is a relative of or associated with the bankruptcy judge, the judge may not allow
compensation to the attorney or accountant. Section 101(34) defines relative and Rule 9001 incorporates the
definitions of the Code. See the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 5002.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1985 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) was affected by the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, P.L.
98–353, 98 Stat. 333. The 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act, P.L. 95–598, included bankruptcy judges in the
definition of United States judges in 28 U.S.C. §451 and they were therefore subject to the provisions of 28
U.S.C. §455. This was to become effective on April 1, 1984, P.L. 95–598, §404(b). Section 113 of P.L.
98–353, however, appears to have rendered the amendment to 28 U.S.C. §451 ineffective. Subdivision (a) of
the rule retains the substance and intent of the earlier draft by making bankruptcy judges subject to 28 U.S.C.
§455.
The word "associated" in subdivision (b) has been changed to "connected" in order to conform with Rule
5002(b).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to be gender neutral. The bankruptcy judge before whom the matter is pending
determines whether disqualification is required.
1 So in original. Probably should be "circumstance".
Rule 5005. Filing and Transmittal of Papers
(a) FILING.
(1) Place of Filing. The lists, schedules, statements, proofs of claim or interest, complaints,
motions, applications, objections and other papers required to be filed by these rules, except as
provided in 28 U.S.C. §1409, shall be filed with the clerk in the district where the case under the
Code is pending. The judge of that court may permit the papers to be filed with the judge, in which
event the filing date shall be noted thereon, and they shall be forthwith transmitted to the clerk.
[Release Point 118-106]
The clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any petition or other paper presented for the purpose
of filing solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules or any local
rules or practices.
(2) Electronic Filing and Signing.
(A) By a Represented Entity—Generally Required; Exceptions. An entity represented by an
attorney shall file electronically, unless nonelectronic filing is allowed by the court for good
cause or is allowed or required by local rule.
(B) By an Unrepresented Individual—When Allowed or Required. An individual not
represented by an attorney:
(i) may file electronically only if allowed by court order or by local rule; and
(ii) may be required to file electronically only by court order, or by a local rule that
includes reasonable exceptions.
(C) Signing. A filing made through a person's electronic-filing account and authorized by that
person, together with that person's name on a signature block, constitutes the person's signature.
(D) Same as a Written Paper. A paper filed electronically is a written paper for purposes of
these rules, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure made applicable by these rules, and §107 of
the Code.
(b) TRANSMITTAL TO THE UNITED STATES TRUSTEE.
(1) The complaints, notices, motions, applications, objections and other papers required to be
transmitted to the United States trustee may be sent by filing with the court's electronic-filing
system in accordance with Rule 9036, unless a court order or local rule provides otherwise.
(2) The entity, other than the clerk, transmitting a paper to the United States trustee other than
through the court's electronic-filing system shall promptly file as proof of such transmittal a
statement identifying the paper and stating the manner by which and the date on which it was
transmitted to the United States trustee.
(3) Nothing in these rules shall require the clerk to transmit any paper to the United States
trustee if the United States trustee requests in writing that the paper not be transmitted.
(c) ERROR IN FILING OR TRANSMITTAL. A paper intended to be filed with the clerk but
erroneously delivered to the United States trustee, the trustee, the attorney for the trustee, a
bankruptcy judge, a district judge, the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel, or the clerk of the
district court shall, after the date of its receipt has been noted thereon, be transmitted forthwith to the
clerk of the bankruptcy court. A paper intended to be transmitted to the United States trustee but
erroneously delivered to the clerk, the trustee, the attorney for the trustee, a bankruptcy judge, a
district judge, the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel, or the clerk of the district court shall, after
the date of its receipt has been noted thereon, be transmitted forthwith to the United States trustee. In
the interest of justice, the court may order that a paper erroneously delivered shall be deemed filed
with the clerk or transmitted to the United States trustee as of the date of its original delivery.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a) is an adaptation of Rule 5(e) F.R.Civ.P. Sections 301–304 of the Code and Rules 1002 and
1003 require that cases under the Code be commenced by filing a petition "with the bankruptcy court." Other
sections of the Code and other rules refer to or contemplate filing but there is no specific reference to filing
with the bankruptcy court. For example, §501 of the Code requires filing of proofs of claim and Rule 3016(c)
requires the filing of a disclosure statement. This subdivision applies to all situations in which filing is
required. Except when filing in another district is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §1473, all papers, including
complaints commencing adversary proceedings, must be filed in the court where the case under the Code is
pending.
Subdivision (b) is the same as former Bankruptcy Rule 509(c).
[Release Point 118-106]
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to conform with the 1984 amendments.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b)(1) is flexible in that it permits the United States trustee to designate a place or places for
receiving papers within the district in which the case is pending. Transmittal of papers to the United States
trustee may be accomplished by mail or delivery, including delivery by courier, and the technical
requirements for service of process are not applicable. Although papers relating to a proceeding commenced
in another district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1409 must be filed with the clerk in that district, the papers required
to be transmitted to the United States trustee must be mailed or delivered to the United States trustee in the
district in which the case under the Code is pending. The United States trustee in the district in which the case
is pending monitors the progress of the case and should be informed of all developments in the case wherever
the developments take place.
Subdivision (b)(2) requires that proof of transmittal to the United States trustee be filed with the clerk. If
papers are served on the United States trustee by mail or otherwise, the filing of proof of service would satisfy
the requirements of this subdivision. This requirement enables the court to assure that papers are actually
transmitted to the United States trustee in compliance with the rules. When the rules require that a paper be
transmitted to the United States trustee and proof of transmittal has not been filed with the clerk, the court
should not schedule a hearing or should take other appropriate action to assure that the paper is transmitted to
the United States trustee. The filing of the verified statement with the clerk also enables other parties in
interest to determine whether a paper has been transmitted to the United States trustee.
Subdivision (b)(3) is designed to relieve the clerk of any obligation under these rules to transmit any paper
to the United States trustee if the United States trustee does not wish to receive it.
Subdivision (c) is amended to include the erroneous delivery of papers intended to be transmitted to the
United States trustee.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to conform to the 1991 amendment to Rule 5(e) F.R.Civ.P. It is not a suitable
role for the office of the clerk to refuse to accept for filing papers not conforming to requirements of form
imposed by these rules or by local rules or practices. The enforcement of these rules and local rules is a role
for a judge. This amendment does not require the clerk to accept for filing papers sent to the clerk's office by
facsimile transmission.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1996 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to permit, but not require, courts to adopt local rules that allow filing, signing, or
verifying of documents by electronic means. However, such local rules must be consistent with technical
standards, if any, promulgated by the Judicial Conference of the United States.
An important benefit to be derived by permitting filing by electronic means is that the extensive volume of
paper received and maintained as records in the clerk's office will be reduced substantially. With the receipt of
electronic data transmissions by computer, the clerk may maintain records electronically without the need to
reproduce them in tangible paper form.
Judicial Conference standards governing the technological aspects of electronic filing will result in
uniformity among judicial districts to accommodate an increasingly national bar. By delegating to the Judicial
Conference the establishment and future amendment of national standards for electronic filing, the Supreme
Court and Congress will be relieved of the burden of reviewing and promulgating detailed rules dealing with
complex technological standards. Another reason for leaving to the Judicial Conference the formulation of
technological standards for electronic filing is that advances in computer technology occur often, and changes
in the technological standards may have to be implemented more frequently than would be feasible by rule
amendment under the Rules Enabling Act process.
It is anticipated that standards established by the Judicial Conference will govern technical specifications
for electronic data transmission, such as requirements relating to the formatting of data, speed of transmission,
means to transmit copies of supporting documentation, and security of communication procedures. In
addition, before procedures for electronic filing are implemented, standards must be established to assure the
proper maintenance and integrity of the record and to provide appropriate access and retrieval mechanisms.
These matters will be governed by local rules until system-wide standards are adopted by the Judicial
Conference.
Rule 9009 requires that the Official Forms shall be observed and used "with alterations as may be
appropriate." Compliance with local rules and any Judicial Conference standards with respect to the
formatting or presentation of electronically transmitted data, to the extent that they do not conform to the
[Release Point 118-106]
Official Forms, would be an appropriate alteration within the meaning of Rule 9009.
These rules require that certain documents be in writing. For example, Rule 3001 states that a proof of
claim is a "written statement." Similarly, Rule 3007 provides that an objection to a claim "shall be in writing."
Pursuant to the new subdivision (a)(2), any requirement under these rules that a paper be written may be
satisfied by filing the document by electronic means, notwithstanding the fact that the clerk neither receives
nor prints a paper reproduction of the electronic data.
Section 107(a) of the Code provides that a "paper" filed in a case is a public record open to examination by
an entity at reasonable times without charge, except as provided in §107(b). The amendment to subdivision
(a)(2) provides that an electronically filed document is to be treated as such a public record.
Although under subdivision (a)(2) electronically filed documents may be treated as written papers or as
signed or verified writings, it is important to emphasize that such treatment is only for the purpose of applying
these rules. In addition, local rules and Judicial Conference standards regarding verification must satisfy the
requirements of 28 U.S.C. §1746.
GAP Report on Rule 5005. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2006 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a). Amended Rule 5005(a)(2) acknowledges that many courts have required electronic filing
by means of a standing order, procedures manual, or local rule. These local practices reflect the advantages
that courts and most litigants realize from electronic filings. Courts requiring electronic filing must make
reasonable exceptions for persons for whom electronic filing of documents constitutes an unreasonable denial
of access to the courts. Experience with the rule will facilitate convergence on uniform exceptions in an
amended Rule 5005(a)(2).
Subdivision (c). The rule is amended to include the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel among the list of
persons required to transmit to the proper person erroneously filed or transmitted papers. The amendment is
necessary because the bankruptcy appellate panels were not in existence at the time of the original
promulgation of the rule. The amendment also inserts the district judge on the list of persons required to
transmit papers intended for the United States trustee but erroneously sent to another person. The district
judge is included in the list of persons who must transmit papers to the clerk of the bankruptcy court in the
first part of the rule, and there is no reason to exclude the district judge from the list of persons who must
transmit erroneously filed papers to the United States trustee.
Changes Made After Publication. The published version of the Rule did not include the sentence set out on
lines 7–10 above [sic]. The Advisory Committee concluded, based on the written comments received and
additional Advisory Committee consideration, that the text of the rule should include a statement regarding the
need for courts to protect access to the courts for those whose status might not allow for electronic
participation in cases. The published version had relegated this notion to the Committee Note, but further
deliberations led to the conclusion that this matter is too important to leave to the Committee Note and instead
should be included in the text of the rule.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
Electronic filing has matured. Most districts have adopted local rules that require electronic filing and allow
reasonable exceptions as required by the former rule. The time has come to seize the advantages of electronic
filing by making it mandatory in all districts, except for filings made by an individual not represented by an
attorney. But exceptions continue to be available. Paper filing must be allowed for good cause. And a local
rule may allow or require paper filing for other reasons.
Filings by an individual not represented by an attorney are treated separately. It is not yet possible to rely on
an assumption that pro se litigants are generally able to seize the advantages of electronic filing. Encounters
with the court's system may prove overwhelming to some. Attempts to work within the system may generate
substantial burdens on a pro se party, on other parties, and on the court. Rather than mandate electronic filing,
filing by pro se litigants is left for governing by local rules or court order. Efficiently handled electronic filing
works to the advantage of all parties and the court. Many courts now allow electronic filing by pro se litigants
with the court's permission. Such approaches may expand with growing experience in these and other courts,
along with the growing availability of the systems required for electronic filing and the increasing familiarity
of most people with electronic communication. Room is also left for a court to require electronic filing by a
pro se litigant by court order or by local rule. Care should be taken to ensure that an order to file electronically
does not impede access to the court, and reasonable exceptions must be included in a local rule that requires
electronic filing by a pro se litigant.
A filing made through a person's electronic-filing account and authorized by that person, together with that
person's name on a signature block, constitutes the person's signature. A person's electronic-filing account
means an account established by the court for use of the court's electronic-filing system, which account the
[Release Point 118-106]
person accesses with the user name and password (or other credentials) issued to that person by the court.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b)(1) is amended to authorize the clerk or parties to transmit papers to the United States trustee
by electronic means in accordance with Rule 9036, regardless of whether the United States trustee is a
registered user with the court's electronic-filing system. Subdivision (b)(2) is amended to recognize that
parties meeting transmittal obligations to the United States trustee using the court's electronic-filing system
need not file a statement evidencing transmittal under Rule 5005(b)(2). The amendment to subdivision (b)(2)
also eliminates the requirement that statements evidencing transmittal filed under Rule 5005(b)(2) be verified.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule supplements 28 U.S.C. §773. A record of proceedings before the bankruptcy judge is to be made
whenever practicable. By whatever means the record is made, subdivision (a) requires that the preparer of the
record certify and file the original notes, tape recording, or other form of sound recording of the proceedings.
Similarly, if a transcript is requested, the preparer is to file a certified copy with the clerk.
Subdivision (b) is derived from 28 U.S.C. §753(f).

Rule 5008. Notice Regarding Presumption of Abuse in Chapter 7 Cases of
[Release Point 118-106]
Individual Debtors
If a presumption of abuse has arisen under §707(b) in a chapter 7 case of an individual with
primarily consumer debts, the clerk shall within 10 days after the date of the filing of the petition
notify creditors of the presumption of abuse in accordance with Rule 2002. If the debtor has not filed
a statement indicating whether a presumption of abuse has arisen, the clerk shall within 10 days after
the date of the filing of the petition notify creditors that the debtor has not filed the statement and that
further notice will be given if a later filed statement indicates that a presumption of abuse has arisen.
If a debtor later files a statement indicating that a presumption of abuse has arisen, the clerk shall
notify creditors of the presumption of abuse as promptly as practicable.
(Added Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991
This rule [Rule 5008. Funds of the Estate; abrogated Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991] is abrogated in view
of the amendments to §345(b) of the Code and the role of the United States trustee in approving bonds and
supervising trustees.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008
This rule is new. The 2005 amendments to §342 of the Code require that clerks give written notice to all
creditors not later than 10 days after the date of the filing of the petition that a presumption of abuse has arisen
under §707(b). A statement filed by the debtor will be the source of the clerk's information about the
presumption of abuse. This rule enables the clerk to meet its obligation to send the notice within the statutory
time period set forth in §342. In the event that the court receives the debtor's statement after the clerk has sent
the first notice, and the debtor's statement indicates a presumption of abuse, the rule requires that the clerk
send a second notice.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
Rule 5009. Closing Chapter 7, Chapter 12, Chapter 13, and Chapter 15 Cases;
Order Declaring Lien Satisfied
(a) CLOSING OF CASES UNDER CHAPTERS 7, 12, AND 13. If in a chapter 7, chapter 12, or
chapter 13 case the trustee has filed a final report and final account and has certified that the estate
has been fully administered, and if within 30 days no objection has been filed by the United States
trustee or a party in interest, there shall be a presumption that the estate has been fully administered.
(b) NOTICE OF FAILURE TO FILE RULE 1007(b)(7) STATEMENT. If an individual debtor in
a chapter 7 or 13 case is required to file a statement under Rule 1007(b)(7) and fails to do so within
45 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under §341(a) of the Code, the clerk shall
promptly notify the debtor that the case will be closed without entry of a discharge unless the
required statement is filed within the applicable time limit under Rule 1007(c).
(c) CASES UNDER CHAPTER 15. A foreign representative in a proceeding recognized under
§1517 of the Code shall file a final report when the purpose of the representative's appearance in the
court is completed. The report shall describe the nature and results of the representative's activities in
the court. The foreign representative shall transmit the report to the United States trustee, and give
notice of its filing to the debtor, all persons or bodies authorized to administer foreign proceedings of
the debtor, all parties to litigation pending in the United States in which the debtor was a party at the
time of the filing of the petition, and such other entities as the court may direct. The foreign
representative shall file a certificate with the court that notice has been given. If no objection has
been filed by the United States trustee or a party in interest within 30 days after the certificate is
filed, there shall be a presumption that the case has been fully administered.
(d) ORDER DECLARING LIEN SATISFIED. In a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case, if a claim that
was secured by property of the estate is subject to a lien under applicable nonbankruptcy law, the
debtor may request entry of an order declaring that the secured claim has been satisfied and the lien
[Release Point 118-106]
has been released under the terms of a confirmed plan. The request shall be made by motion and
shall be served on the holder of the claim and any other entity the court designates in the manner
provided by Rule 7004 for service of a summons and complaint.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 28, 2010, eff. Dec. 1, 2010; Apr. 16, 2013, eff.
Dec. 1, 2013; Apr. 27, 2017, eff. Dec. 1, 2017.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is the same as §350(a) of the Code. An estate may be closed even though the period allowed by
Rule 3002(c) for filing claims has not expired. The closing of a case may be expedited when a notice of no
dividends is given under Rule 2002(e). Dismissal of a case for want of prosecution or failure to pay filing fees
is governed by Rule 1017.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The final report and account of the trustee is required to be filed with the court and the United States trustee
under §§704(9), 1202(b)(1), and 1302(b)(1) of the Code. This amendment facilitates the United States
trustee's performance of statutory duties to supervise trustees and administer cases under chapters 7, 12, and
13 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §586. In the absence of a timely objection by the United States trustee or a party in
interest, the court may discharge the trustee and close the case pursuant to §350(a) without the need to review
the final report and account or to determine the merits of the trustee's certification that the estate has been fully
administered.
Rule 3022 governs the closing of chapter 11 cases.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2010 AMENDMENT
Subdivisions (a) and (b). The rule is amended to redesignate the former rule as subdivision (a) and to add
new subdivisions (b) and (c) to the rule. Subdivision (b) requires the clerk to provide notice to an individual
debtor in a chapter 7 or 13 case that the case may be closed without the entry of a discharge due to the failure
of the debtor to file a timely statement of completion of a personal financial management course. The purpose
of the notice is to provide the debtor with an opportunity to complete the course and file the appropriate
document prior to the filing deadline. Timely filing of the document avoids the need for a motion to extend the
time retroactively. It also avoids the potential for closing the case without discharge, and the possible need to
pay an additional fee in connection with reopening. Timely filing also benefits the clerk's office by reducing
the number of instances in which cases must be reopened.
Subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) requires a foreign representative in a chapter 15 case to file a final report
setting out the foreign representative's actions and results obtained in the United States court. It also requires
the foreign representative to give notice of the filing of the report, and provides interested parties with 30 days
to object to the report after the foreign representative has certified that notice has been given. In the absence of
a timely objection, a presumption arises that the case is fully administered, and the case may be closed.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2013 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is amended to conform to the amendment of Rule 1007(b)(7). Rule 1007(b)(7) relieves an
individual debtor of the obligation to file a statement of completion of a personal financial management course
if the course provider notifies the court that the debtor has completed the course. The clerk's duty under
subdivision (b) to notify the debtor of the possible closure of the case without discharge if the statement is not
timely filed therefore applies only if the course provider has not already notified the court of the debtor's
completion of the course.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2017 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (d) is added to provide a procedure by which a debtor in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case may
request an order declaring a secured claim satisfied and a lien released under the terms of a confirmed plan. A
debtor may need documentation for title purposes of the elimination of a second mortgage or other lien that
was secured by property of the estate. Although requests for such orders are likely to be made at the time the
case is being closed, the rule does not prohibit a request at another time if the lien has been released and any
other requirements for entry of the order have been met.
Other changes to this rule are stylistic.
[Release Point 118-106]
Rule 5010. Reopening Cases
A case may be reopened on motion of the debtor or other party in interest pursuant to §350(b) of
the Code. In a chapter 7, 12, or 13 case a trustee shall not be appointed by the United States trustee
unless the court determines that a trustee is necessary to protect the interests of creditors and the
debtor or to insure efficient administration of the case.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Section 350(b) of the Code provides: "A case may be reopened in the court in which such case was closed
to administer assets, to accord relief to the debtor, or for other cause."
Rule 9024, which incorporates Rule 60 F.R.Civ.P., exempts motions to reopen cases under the Code from
the one year limitation of Rule 60(b).
Although a case has been closed the court may sometimes act without reopening the case. Under Rule 9024,
clerical errors in judgments, orders, or other parts of the record or errors therein caused by oversight or
omission may be corrected. A judgment determined to be non-dischargeable pursuant to Rule 4007 may be
enforced after a case is closed by a writ of execution obtained pursuant to Rule 7069.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
In order to avoid unnecessary cost and delay, the rule is amended to permit reopening of a case without the
appointment of a trustee when the services of a trustee are not needed.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to conform to the 1986 amendments to the Code that give the United States trustee the
duty to appoint trustees in chapter 7, 12 and 13 cases. See §§701, 702(d), 1202(a), and 1302(a) of the Code. In
most reopened cases, a trustee is not needed because there are no assets to be administered. Therefore, in the
interest of judicial economy, this rule is amended so that a motion will not be necessary unless the United
States trustee or a party in interest seeks the appointment of a trustee in the reopened case.
Rule 5011. Withdrawal and Abstention from Hearing a Proceeding
(a) WITHDRAWAL. A motion for withdrawal of a case or proceeding shall be heard by a district
judge.
(b) ABSTENTION FROM HEARING A PROCEEDING. A motion for abstention pursuant to 28
U.S.C. §1334(c) shall be governed by Rule 9014 and shall be served on the parties to the proceeding.
(c) EFFECT OF FILING OF MOTION FOR WITHDRAWAL OR ABSTENTION. The filing of
a motion for withdrawal of a case or proceeding or for abstention pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1334(c)
shall not stay the administration of the case or any proceeding therein before the bankruptcy judge
except that the bankruptcy judge may stay, on such terms and conditions as are proper, proceedings
pending disposition of the motion. A motion for a stay ordinarily shall be presented first to the
bankruptcy judge. A motion for a stay or relief from a stay filed in the district court shall state why it
has not been presented to or obtained from the bankruptcy judge. Relief granted by the district judge
shall be on such terms and conditions as the judge deems proper.
(Added Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987
Motions for withdrawal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §157(d) or abstention pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1334(c), like all
other motions, are to be filed with the clerk as required by Rule 5005(a). If a bankruptcy clerk has been
appointed for the district, all motions are filed with the bankruptcy clerk. The method for forwarding
withdrawal motions to the district court will be established by administrative procedures.
Subdivision (a). Section 157(d) permits the district court to order withdrawal on its own motion or the
motion of a party. Subdivision (a) of this rule makes it clear that the bankruptcy judge will not conduct
hearings on a withdrawal motion. The withdrawal decision is committed exclusively to the district court.
Subdivision (b). A decision to abstain under 28 U.S.C. §1334(c) is not appealable. The district court is
vested originally with jurisdiction and the decision to relinquish that jurisdiction must ultimately be a matter
for the district court. The bankruptcy judge ordinarily will be in the best position to evaluate the grounds
[Release Point 118-106]
asserted for abstention. This subdivision (b) provides that the initial hearing on the motion is before the
bankruptcy judge. The procedure for review of the report and recommendation are governed by Rule 9033.
This rule does not apply to motions under §305 of the Code for abstention from hearing a case. Judicial
decisions will determine the scope of the bankruptcy judge's authority under §305.
Subdivision (c). Unless the court so orders, proceedings are not stayed when motions are filed for
withdrawal or for abstention from hearing a proceeding. Because of the district court's authority over cases
and proceedings, the subdivision authorizes the district court to order a stay or modify a stay ordered by the
bankruptcy judge.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is amended to delete the restriction that limits the role of the bankruptcy court to the filing
of a report and recommendation for disposition of a motion for abstention under 28 U.S.C. §1334(c)(2). This
amendment is consistent with §309(b) of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 which amended §1334(c)(2)
so that it allows an appeal to the district court of a bankruptcy court's order determining an abstention motion.
This subdivision is also amended to clarify that the motion is a contested matter governed by Rule 9014 and
that it must be served on all parties to the proceeding which is the subject of the motion.
Rule 5012. Agreements Concerning Coordination of Proceedings in Chapter 15
Cases
Approval of an agreement under §1527(4) of the Code shall be sought by motion. The movant
shall attach to the motion a copy of the proposed agreement or protocol and, unless the court directs
otherwise, give at least 30 days' notice of any hearing on the motion by transmitting the motion to the
United States trustee, and serving it on the debtor, all persons or bodies authorized to administer
foreign proceedings of the debtor, all entities against whom provisional relief is being sought under
§1519, all parties to litigation pending in the United States in which the debtor was a party at the
time of the filing of the petition, and such other entities as the court may direct.
(Added Apr. 28, 2010, eff. Dec. 1, 2010.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2010
This rule is new. In chapter 15 cases, any party in interest may seek approval of an agreement, frequently
referred to as a "protocol," that will assist with the conduct of the case. Because the needs of the courts and the
parties may vary greatly from case to case, the rule does not attempt to limit the form or scope of a protocol.
Rather, the rule simply requires that approval of a particular protocol be sought by motion, and designates the
persons entitled to notice of the hearing on the motion. These agreements, or protocols, drafted entirely by
parties in interest in the case, are intended to provide valuable assistance to the court in the management of the
case. Interested parties may find guidelines published by organizations, such as the American Law Institute
and the International Insolvency Institute, helpful in crafting agreements or protocols to apply in a particular
case.

PART VI—COLLECTION AND LIQUIDATION OF THE ESTATE
Rule 6001. Burden of Proof As to Validity of Postpetition Transfer
Any entity asserting the validity of a transfer under §549 of the Code shall have the burden of
proof.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 603. The Act contained, in §70d, a provision placing the
burden of proof on the same person as did Rule 603. The Code does not contain any directive with respect to
the burden of proof. This omission, in all probability, resulted from the intention to leave matters affecting
evidence to these rules. See H. Rep. No. 95–595, 95th Cong. 1st Sess. (1977) 293.

Rule 6002. Accounting by Prior Custodian of Property of the Estate
(a) ACCOUNTING REQUIRED. Any custodian required by the Code to deliver property in the
custodian's possession or control to the trustee shall promptly file and transmit to the United States
trustee a report and account with respect to the property of the estate and the administration thereof.
(b) EXAMINATION OF ADMINISTRATION. On the filing and transmittal of the report and
account required by subdivision (a) of this rule and after an examination has been made into the
superseded administration, after notice and a hearing, the court shall determine the propriety of the
administration, including the reasonableness of all disbursements.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff.
Aug. 1, 1993.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
"Custodian" is defined in §101(10) of the Code. The definition includes a trustee or receiver appointed in
proceedings not under the Code, as well as an assignee for the benefit of creditors.
This rule prescribes the procedure to be followed by a custodian who under §543 of the Code is required to
deliver property to the trustee and to account for its disposition. The examination under subdivision (b) may
be initiated (1) on the motion of the custodian required to account under subdivision (a) for an approval of his
account and discharge thereon, (2) on the motion of, or the filing of an objection to the custodian's account by,
the trustee or any other party in interest, or (3) on the court's own initiative. Rule 9014 applies to any
contested matter arising under this rule.
Section 543(d) is similar to an abstention provision. It grants the bankruptcy court discretion to permit the
custodian to remain in possession and control of the property. In that event, the custodian is excused from
complying with §543(a)–(c) and thus would not be required to turn over the property to the trustee. When
there is no duty to turn over to the trustee, Rule 6002 would not be applicable.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to enable the United States trustee to review, object to, or to otherwise be heard
regarding the custodian's report and accounting. See §§307 and 543 of the Code.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is amended to conform to the language of §102(1) of the Code.
Rule 6003. Interim and Final Relief Immediately Following the Commencement
of the Case—Applications for Employment; Motions for Use, Sale, or Lease
of Property; and Motions for Assumption or Assignment of Executory
Contracts
Except to the extent that relief is necessary to avoid immediate and irreparable harm, the court
shall not, within 21 days after the filing of the petition, issue an order granting the following:
(a) an application under Rule 2014;
(b) a motion to use, sell, lease, or otherwise incur an obligation regarding property of the estate,
including a motion to pay all or part of a claim that arose before the filing of the petition, but not a
motion under Rule 4001; or
(c) a motion to assume or assign an executory contract or unexpired lease in accordance with
§365.
(Added Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007; amended Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009; Apr. 26, 2011,

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991
This rule [Former Rule 6003—Disbursement of Money of the Estate (Abrogated Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1,
1991)] is abrogated in view of the role of the United States trustee in supervising trustees. Use of estate funds
by a trustee or debtor in possession is governed by §363 of the Code.
[Release Point 118-106]
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2007
There can be a flurry of activity during the first days of a bankruptcy case. This activity frequently takes
place prior to the formation of a creditors' committee, and it also can include substantial amounts of materials
for the court and parties in interest to review and evaluate. This rule is intended to alleviate some of the time
pressures present at the start of a case so that full and close consideration can be given to matters that may
have a fundamental impact on the case.
The rule provides that the court cannot grant relief on applications for the employment of professional
persons, motions for the use, sale, or lease of property of the estate other than such a motion under Rule 4001,
and motions to assume or assign executory contracts and unexpired leases for the first 20 days of the case,
unless granting relief is necessary to avoid immediate and irreparable harm. This standard is taken from Rule
4001(b)(2) and (c)(2), and decisions under those provisions should provide guidance for the application of this
provision.
This rule does not govern motions and applications made more than 20 days after the filing of the petition.
Changes After Publication. Subdivision (c) was amended by deleting the reference to the rejection of
executory contracts or unexpired leases. The rule, as revised, now limits only the assumption or assignment of
executory contracts or unexpired leases in that subdivision.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2011 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to clarify that it limits the timing of the entry of certain orders, but does not prevent the
court from providing an effective date for such an order that may relate back to the time of the filing of the
application or motion, or to some other date. For example, while the rule prohibits, absent immediate and
irreparable harm, the court from authorizing the employment of counsel during the first 21 days of a case, it
does not prevent the court from providing in an order entered after expiration of the 21-day period that the
relief requested in the motion or application is effective as of a date earlier than the issuance of the order. Nor
does it prohibit the filing of an application or motion for relief prior to expiration of the 21-day period.
Nothing in the rule prevents a professional from representing the trustee or a debtor in possession pending the
approval of an application for the approval of the employment under Rule 2014.
The amendment also clarifies that the scope of the rule is limited to granting the specifically identified relief
set out in the subdivisions of the rule. Deleting "regarding" from the rule clarifies that the rule does not
prohibit the court from entering orders in the first 21 days of the case that may relate to the motions and
applications set out in (a), (b), and (c); it is only prohibited from granting the relief requested by those motions
or applications. For example, in the first 21 days of the case, the court could grant the relief requested in a
motion to establish bidding procedures for the sale of property of the estate, but it could not, absent immediate
and irreparable harm, grant a motion to approve the sale of property.
Changes Made After Publication. Minor stylistic changes were made to the Committee Note following
publication.
Rule 6004. Use, Sale, or Lease of Property
(a) NOTICE OF PROPOSED USE, SALE, OR LEASE OF PROPERTY. Notice of a proposed
use, sale, or lease of property, other than cash collateral, not in the ordinary course of business shall
be given pursuant to Rule 2002(a)(2), (c)(1), (i), and (k) and, if applicable, in accordance with
§363(b)(2) of the Code.
(b) OBJECTION TO PROPOSAL. Except as provided in subdivisions (c) and (d) of this rule, an
objection to a proposed use, sale, or lease of property shall be filed and served not less than seven
days before the date set for the proposed action or within the time fixed by the court. An objection to
[Release Point 118-106]
the proposed use, sale, or lease of property is governed by Rule 9014.
(c) SALE FREE AND CLEAR OF LIENS AND OTHER INTERESTS. A motion for authority to
sell property free and clear of liens or other interests shall be made in accordance with Rule 9014 and
shall be served on the parties who have liens or other interests in the property to be sold. The notice
required by subdivision (a) of this rule shall include the date of the hearing on the motion and the
time within which objections may be filed and served on the debtor in possession or trustee.
(d) SALE OF PROPERTY UNDER $2,500. Notwithstanding subdivision (a) of this rule, when all
of the nonexempt property of the estate has an aggregate gross value less than $2,500, it shall be
sufficient to give a general notice of intent to sell such property other than in the ordinary course of
business to all creditors, indenture trustees, committees appointed or elected pursuant to the Code,
the United States trustee and other persons as the court may direct. An objection to any such sale
may be filed and served by a party in interest within 14 days of the mailing of the notice, or within
the time fixed by the court. An objection is governed by Rule 9014.
(e) HEARING. If a timely objection is made pursuant to subdivision (b) or (d) of this rule, the date
of the hearing thereon may be set in the notice given pursuant to subdivision (a) of this rule.
(f) CONDUCT OF SALE NOT IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.
(1) Public or Private Sale. All sales not in the ordinary course of business may be by private
sale or by public auction. Unless it is impracticable, an itemized statement of the property sold, the
name of each purchaser, and the price received for each item or lot or for the property as a whole
if sold in bulk shall be filed on completion of a sale. If the property is sold by an auctioneer, the
auctioneer shall file the statement, transmit a copy thereof to the United States trustee, and furnish
a copy to the trustee, debtor in possession, or chapter 13 debtor. If the property is not sold by an
auctioneer, the trustee, debtor in possession, or chapter 13 debtor shall file the statement and
transmit a copy thereof to the United States trustee.
(2) Execution of Instruments. After a sale in accordance with this rule the debtor, the trustee, or
debtor in possession, as the case may be, shall execute any instrument necessary or ordered by the
court to effectuate the transfer to the purchaser.
(g) SALE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.
(1) Motion. A motion for authority to sell or lease personally identifiable information under
§363(b)(1)(B) shall include a request for an order directing the United States trustee to appoint a
consumer privacy ombudsman under §332. Rule 9014 governs the motion which shall be served
on: any committee elected under §705 or appointed under §1102 of the Code, or if the case is a
chapter 11 reorganization case and no committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed under
§1102, on the creditors included on the list of creditors filed under Rule 1007(d); and on such
other entities as the court may direct. The motion shall be transmitted to the United States trustee.
(2) Appointment. If a consumer privacy ombudsman is appointed under §332, no later than
seven days before the hearing on the motion under §363(b)(1)(B), the United States trustee shall
file a notice of the appointment, including the name and address of the person appointed. The
United States trustee's notice shall be accompanied by a verified statement of the person appointed
setting forth the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their
respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, or any person employed in the
office of the United States trustee.
(h) STAY OF ORDER AUTHORIZING USE, SALE, OR LEASE OF PROPERTY. An order
authorizing the use, sale, or lease of property other than cash collateral is stayed until the expiration
of 14 days after entry of the order, unless the court orders otherwise.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 26, 1999, eff.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivisions (a) and (b). Pursuant to §363(b) of the Code, a trustee or debtor in possession may use, sell, or
lease property other than in the ordinary course of business only after notice and hearing. Rule 2002(a), (c)
and (i) specifies the time when notice of sale is to be given, the contents of the notice and the persons to whom
[Release Point 118-106]
notice is to be given of sales of property. Subdivision (a) makes those provisions applicable as well to notices
for proposed use and lease of property.
The Code does not provide the time within which parties may file objections to a proposed sale.
Subdivision (b) of the rule requires the objection to be in writing and filed not less than five days before the
proposed action is to take place. The objection should also be served within that time on the person who is
proposing to take the action which would be either the trustee or debtor in possession. This time period is
subject to change by the court. In some instances there is a need to conduct a sale in a short period of time and
the court is given discretion to tailor the requirements to the circumstances.
Subdivision (c). In some situations a notice of sale for different pieces of property to all persons specified in
Rule 2002(a) may be uneconomic and inefficient. This is particularly true in some chapter 7 liquidation cases
when there is property of relatively little value which must be sold by the trustee. Subdivision (c) allows a
general notice of intent to sell when the aggregate value of the estate's property is less than $2,500. The gross
value is the value of the property without regard to the amount of any debt secured by a lien on the property. It
is not necessary to give a detailed notice specifying the time and place of a particular sale. Thus, the
requirements of Rule 2002(c) need not be met. If this method of providing notice of sales is used, the
subdivision specifies that parties in interest may serve and file objections to the proposed sale of any property
within the class and the time for service and filing is fixed at not later than 15 days after mailing the notice.
The court may fix a different time. Subdivision (c) would have little utility in chapter 11 cases. Pursuant to
Rule 2002(i), the court can limit notices of sale to the creditors' committee appointed under §1102 of the Code
and the same burdens present in a small chapter 7 case would not exist.
Subdivision (d). If a timely objection is filed, a hearing is required with respect to the use, sale, or lease of
property. Subdivision (d) renders the filing of an objection tantamount to requesting a hearing so as to require
a hearing pursuant to §§363(b) and 102(l)(B)(i).
Subdivision (e) is derived in part from former Bankruptcy Rule 606(b) but does not carry forward the
requirement of that rule that court approval be obtained for sales of property. Pursuant to §363(b) court
approval is not required unless timely objection is made to the proposed sale. The itemized statement or
information required by the subdivision is not necessary when it would be impracticable to prepare it or set
forth the information. For example, a liquidation sale of retail goods although not in the ordinary course of
business may be on a daily ongoing basis and only summaries may be available.
The duty imposed by paragraph (2) does not affect the power of the bankruptcy court to order third persons
to execute instruments transferring property purchased at a sale under this subdivision. See, e.g., In re
Rosenberg, 138 F.2d 409 (7th Cir. 1943).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to conform to the 1984 amendments to §363(b)(2) of the Code.
Subdivision (b) is amended to provide that an objection to a proposed use, sale, or lease of property creates
a contested matter governed by Rule 9014. A similar amendment is made to subdivision (d), which was
formerly subdivision (c).
Subdivision (c) is new. Section 363(f) provides that sales free and clear of liens or other interests are only
permitted if one of the five statutory requirements is satisfied. Rule 9013 requires that a motion state with
particularity the grounds relied upon by the movant. A motion for approval of a sale free and clear of liens or
other interests is subject to Rule 9014, service must be made on the parties holding liens or other interests in
the property, and notice of the hearing on the motion and the time for filing objections must be included in the
notice given under subdivision (a).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to provide notice to the United States trustee of a proposed use, sale or lease of
property not in the ordinary course of business. See Rule 2002(k). Subdivision (f)(1) is amended to enable the
United States trustee to monitor the progress of the case in accordance with 28 U.S.C. §586(a)(3)(G).
The words "with the clerk" in subdivision (f)(1) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (g) is added to provide sufficient time for a party to request a stay pending appeal of an order
authorizing the use, sale, or lease of property under §363(b) of the Code before the order is implemented. It
does not affect the time for filing a notice of appeal in accordance with Rule 8002.
Rule 6004(g) does not apply to orders regarding the use of cash collateral and does not affect the trustee's
right to use, sell, or lease property without a court order to the extent permitted under §363 of the Code.
The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 6004(g) is not applicable so that the property may be used,
sold, or leased immediately in accordance with the order entered by the court. Alternatively, the court may
[Release Point 118-106]
order that the stay under Rule 6004(g) is for a fixed period less than 10 days.
GAP Report on Rule 6004. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended by inserting a new subdivision (g) to implement §§332 and 363(b)(1)(B) of the Code,
added by the 2005 amendments. This rule governs the proposed transfer of personally identifiable information
in a manner inconsistent with any policy covering the transfer of the information. Rule 2002(c)(1) requires the
seller to state in the notice of the sale or lease whether the transfer is consistent with and policy governing the
transfer of the information.
Under §332 of the Code, the consumer privacy ombudsman must be appointed at least five days prior to the
hearing on a sale or lease of personally identifiable information. In an appropriate case, the consumer privacy
ombudsman may seek a continuance of the hearing on the proposed sale to perform the tasks required of the
ombudsman by §332 of the Code.
Former subdivision (g) is redesignated as subdivision (h).
Changes Made After Publication. The Committee Note was amended to highlight the connection between
this rule and Rule 2002 with regard to the obligation to provide notice of proposed transactions. It was also
amended to recognize the ability of the consumer privacy ombudsman to seek a continuance of a hearing on
the proposed sale of personally identifiable information.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
Rule 6005. Appraisers and Auctioneers
The order of the court approving the employment of an appraiser or auctioneer shall fix the
amount or rate of compensation. No officer or employee of the Judicial Branch of the United States
or the United States Department of Justice shall be eligible to act as appraiser or auctioneer. No
residence or licensing requirement shall disqualify an appraiser or auctioneer from employment.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 606(c) and implements §327 of the Code. Pursuant to
§327, the trustee or debtor in possession may employ one or more appraisers or auctioneers, subject to court
approval. This rule requires the court order approving such employment to fix the amount or rate of
compensation. The second sentence of the former rule is retained to continue to safeguard against imputations
of favoritism which detract from public confidence in bankruptcy administration. The final sentence is to
guard against imposition of parochial requirements not warranted by any consideration having to do with
sound bankruptcy administration.
Reference should also be made to Rule 2013(a) regarding the limitation on employment of appraisers and
auctioneers, and Rule 2014(a) regarding the application for appointment of an appraiser or auctioneer.
Rule 6006. Assumption, Rejection or Assignment of an Executory Contract or
Unexpired Lease
(a) PROCEEDING TO ASSUME, REJECT, OR ASSIGN. A proceeding to assume, reject, or
assign an executory contract or unexpired lease, other than as part of a plan, is governed by Rule
9014.
(b) PROCEEDING TO REQUIRE TRUSTEE TO ACT. A proceeding by a party to an executory
[Release Point 118-106]
contract or unexpired lease in a chapter 9 municipality case, chapter 11 reorganization case, chapter
12 family farmer's debt adjustment case, or chapter 13 individual's debt adjustment case, to require
the trustee, debtor in possession, or debtor to determine whether to assume or reject the contract or
lease is governed by Rule 9014.
(c) NOTICE. Notice of a motion made pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of this rule shall be given
to the other party to the contract or lease, to other parties in interest as the court may direct, and,
except in a chapter 9 municipality case, to the United States trustee.
(d) STAY OF ORDER AUTHORIZING ASSIGNMENT. An order authorizing the trustee to
assign an executory contract or unexpired lease under §365(f) is stayed until the expiration of 14
days after the entry of the order, unless the court orders otherwise.
(e) LIMITATIONS. The trustee shall not seek authority to assume or assign multiple executory
contracts or unexpired leases in one motion unless: (1) all executory contracts or unexpired leases to
be assumed or assigned are between the same parties or are to be assigned to the same assignee; (2)
the trustee seeks to assume, but not assign to more than one assignee, unexpired leases of real
property; or (3) the court otherwise authorizes the motion to be filed. Subject to subdivision (f), the
trustee may join requests for authority to reject multiple executory contracts or unexpired leases in
one motion.
(f) OMNIBUS MOTIONS. A motion to reject or, if permitted under subdivision (e), a motion to
assume or assign multiple executory contracts or unexpired leases that are not between the same
parties shall:
(1) state in a conspicuous place that parties receiving the omnibus motion should locate their
names and their contracts or leases listed in the motion;
(2) list parties alphabetically and identify the corresponding contract or lease;
(3) specify the terms, including the curing of defaults, for each requested assumption or
assignment;
(4) specify the terms, including the identity of each assignee and the adequate assurance of
future performance by each assignee, for each requested assignment;
(5) be numbered consecutively with other omnibus motions to assume, assign, or reject
executory contracts or unexpired leases; and
(6) be limited to no more than 100 executory contracts or unexpired leases.
(g) FINALITY OF DETERMINATION. The finality of any order respecting an executory
contract or unexpired lease included in an omnibus motion shall be determined as though such
contract or lease had been the subject of a separate motion.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff.

Dec. 1, 2009.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Section 365(a) of the Code requires court approval for the assumption or rejection of an executory contract
by the trustee or debtor in possession. The trustee or debtor in possession may also assign an executory
contract, §365(f)(1), but must first assume the contract, §365(f)(2). Rule 6006 provides a procedure for
obtaining court approval. It does not apply to the automatic rejection of contracts which are not assumed in
chapter 7 liquidation cases within 60 days after the order for relief, or to the assumption or rejection of
contracts in a plan pursuant to §1123(b)(2) or §1322(b)(7).
Subdivision (a) by referring to Rule 9014 requires a motion to be brought for the assumption, rejection, or
assignment of an executory contract. Normally, the motion will be brought by the trustee, debtor in possession
or debtor in a chapter 9 or chapter 13 case. The authorization to assume a contract and to assign it may be
sought in a single motion and determined by a single order.
Subdivision (b) makes applicable the same motion procedure when the other party to the contract seeks to
require the chapter officer to take some action. Section 365(d)(2) recognizes that this procedure is available to
these contractual parties. This provision of the Code and subdivision of the rule apply only in chapter 9, 11
and 13 cases. A motion is not necessary in chapter 7 cases because in those cases a contract is deemed rejected
if the trustee does not timely assume it.
Subdivision (c) provides for the court to set a hearing on a motion made under subdivision (a) or (b). The
[Release Point 118-106]
other party to the contract should be given appropriate notice of the hearing and the court may order that other
parties in interest, such as a creditors' committee, also be given notice.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivisions (a) and (b) are amended to conform to the 1984 amendment to §365 of the Code, which
governs assumption or rejection of time share interests.
Section 1113, governing collective bargaining agreements, was added to the Code in 1984. It sets out
requirements that must be met before a collective bargaining agreement may be rejected. The application to
reject a collective bargaining agreement referred to in §1113 shall be made by motion. The motion to reject
creates a contested matter under Rule 9014, and service is made pursuant to Rule 7004 on the representative
of the employees. The time periods set forth in §1113(d) govern the scheduling of the hearing and disposition
of a motion to reject the agreement.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
References to time share interests are deleted as unnecessary. Time share interests are within the scope of
this rule to the extent that they are governed by §365 of the Code.
Subdivision (b) is amended to include chapter 12 cases.
Subdivision (c) is amended to enable the United States trustee to appear and be heard on the issues relating
to the assumption or rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases. See §§307, 365, and 1113 of the
Code.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to delete the requirement for an actual hearing when no request for a hearing is made.
See Rule 9014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (d) is added to provide sufficient time for a party to request a stay pending appeal of an order
authorizing the assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease under §365(f) of the Code before the
assignment is consummated. The stay under subdivision (d) does not affect the time for filing a notice of
appeal in accordance with Rule 8002.
The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 6006(d) is not applicable so that the executory contract or
unexpired lease may be assigned immediately in accordance with the order entered by the court. Alternatively,
the court may order that the stay under Rule 6006(d) is for a fixed period less than 10 days.
GAP Report on Rule 6006. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2007 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to authorize the use of omnibus motions to reject multiple executory contracts and
unexpired leases. In some cases there may be numerous executory contracts and unexpired leases, and this
rule permits the combining of up to one hundred of these contracts and leases in a single motion to initiate the
contested matter.
The rule also is amended to authorize the use of a single motion to assume or assign executory contracts
and unexpired leases (i) when such contracts and leases are with a single nondebtor party, (ii) when such
contracts and leases are being assigned to the same assignee, (iii) when the trustee proposes to assume, but not
assign to more than one assignee, real property leases, or (iv) the court authorizes the filing of a joint motion
to assume or to assume and assign executory contracts and unexpired leases under other circumstances that are
not specifically recognized in the rule.
An omnibus motion to assume, assign, or reject multiple executory contracts and unexpired leases must
comply with the procedural requirements set forth in subdivision (f) of the rule, unless the court orders
otherwise. These requirements are intended to ensure that the nondebtor parties to the contracts and leases
receive effective notice of the motion. Among those requirements is the requirement in subdivision (f)(5) that
these motions be consecutively numbered (e.g., Debtor in Possession's First Omnibus Motion for Authority to
Assume Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, Debtor in Possession's Second Omnibus Motion for
Authority to Assume Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, etc.). There may be a need for several of
these motions in a particular case. Numbering the motions consecutively is essential to keep track of these
motions on the court's docket and should avoid confusion that might otherwise result from similar or
identically-titled motions.
Subdivision (g) of the rule provides that the finality of any order respecting an executory contract or
unexpired lease included in an omnibus motion shall be determined as though such contract or lease had been
the subject of a separate motion. A party seeking to appeal any such order is neither required, nor permitted, to
[Release Point 118-106]
await the court's resolution of all other contracts or leases included in the omnibus motion to obtain appellate
review of the order. The rule permits the listing of multiple contracts or leases for convenience, and that
convenience should not impede timely review of the court's decision with respect to each contract or lease.
Changes After Publication. Subdivision (e) of the proposed rule was amended as suggested by the NBC to
insert a third category of requests that the trustee may make under an omnibus motion. The list of categories
was numbered, and the new category is set out in (e)(2).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following

• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods

• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
Rule 6007. Abandonment or Disposition of Property
(a) NOTICE OF PROPOSED ABANDONMENT OR DISPOSITION; OBJECTIONS; HEARING
. Unless otherwise directed by the court, the trustee or debtor in possession shall give notice of a
proposed abandonment or disposition of property to the United States trustee, all creditors, indenture
trustees, and committees elected pursuant to §705 or appointed pursuant to §1102 of the Code. A
party in interest may file and serve an objection within 14 days of the mailing of the notice, or within
the time fixed by the court. If a timely objection is made, the court shall set a hearing on notice to the
United States trustee and to other entities as the court may direct.
(b) MOTION BY PARTY IN INTEREST. A party in interest may file and serve a motion
requiring the trustee or debtor in possession to abandon property of the estate. Unless otherwise
directed by the court, the party filing the motion shall serve the motion and any notice of the motion
on the trustee or debtor in possession, the United States trustee, all creditors, indenture trustees, and
committees elected pursuant to §705 or appointed pursuant to §1102 of the Code. A party in interest
may file and serve an objection within 14 days of service, or within the time fixed by the court. If a
timely objection is made, the court shall set a hearing on notice to the United States trustee and to
other entities as the court may direct. If the court grants the motion, the order effects the trustee's or
debtor in possession's abandonment without further notice, unless otherwise directed by the court.
[(c) HEARING] (Abrogated Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Aug. 1, 1993)
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Sections 554 and 725 of the Code permit and require abandonment and disposition of property of the estate.
Pursuant to §554, the trustee may abandon property but only after notice and hearing. This section is
applicable in chapter 7, 11 and 13 cases. Section 725 requires the trustee to dispose of property in which
someone other than the estate has an interest, prior to final distribution. It applies only in chapter 7 cases.
Notice and hearing are also required conditions. Section 102(1) provides that "notice and hearing" is construed
to mean appropriate notice and an opportunity for a hearing. Neither §554 nor §725 specify to whom the
notices are to be sent. This rule does not apply to §554(c). Pursuant to that subsection, property is deemed
abandoned if it is not administered. A hearing is not required by the statute.
Subdivision (a) requires the notices to be sent to all creditors, indenture trustees, and committees elected
under §705 or appointed under §1102 of the Code. This may appear burdensome, expensive and inefficient
but the subdivision is in keeping with the Code's requirement for notice and the Code's intent to remove the
bankruptcy judge from undisputed matters. The burden, expense and inefficiency can be alleviated in large
measure by incorporating the notice into or together with the notice of the meeting of creditors so that separate
notices would not be required.
Subdivision (b) implements §554(b) which specifies that a party in interest may request an order that the
[Release Point 118-106]
trustee abandon property. The rule specifies that the request be by motion and, pursuant to the Code, lists the
parties who should receive notice.
Subdivision (c) requires a hearing when an objection under subdivision (a) is filed or a motion under
subdivision (b) is made. Filing of an objection is sufficient to require a hearing; a separate or joined request
for a hearing is unnecessary since the objection itself is tantamount to such a request.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to conform to the 1986 amendments to 28 U.S.C. §586(a) and to the Code. The United
States trustee monitors the progress of the case and has standing to raise, appear and be heard on the issues
relating to the abandonment or other disposition of property. See §§307 and 554 of the Code. Committees of
retired employees appointed under §1114 are not entitled to notice under subdivision (a) of this rule.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to clarify that when a motion is made pursuant to subdivision (b), a hearing is not
required if a hearing is not requested or if there is no opposition to the motion. See Rule 9014. Other
amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2019 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) of the rule is amended to specify the parties to be served with the motion and any notice of
the motion. The rule also establishes an objection deadline. Both of these changes align subdivision (b) more
closely with the procedures set forth in subdivision (a). In addition, the rule clarifies that no further action is
necessary to notice or effect the abandonment of property ordered by the court in connection with a motion
filed under subdivision (b), unless the court directs otherwise.
Rule 6008. Redemption of Property from Lien or Sale
On motion by the debtor, trustee, or debtor in possession and after hearing on notice as the court
may direct, the court may authorize the redemption of property from a lien or from a sale to enforce
a lien in accordance with applicable law.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 609. No provision in the Code addresses the trustee's
right of redemption. Ordinarily the secured creditor should be given notice of the trustee's motion so that any
objection may be raised to the proposed redemption.
The rule applies also to a debtor exercising a right of redemption pursuant to §722. A proceeding under that
section is governed by Rule 9014.
Rule 6009. Prosecution and Defense of Proceedings by Trustee or Debtor in
Possession
With or without court approval, the trustee or debtor in possession may prosecute or may enter an
appearance and defend any pending action or proceeding by or against the debtor, or commence and
prosecute any action or proceeding in behalf of the estate before any tribunal.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 610.
[Release Point 118-106]
Rule 6010. Proceeding to Avoid Indemnifying Lien or Transfer to Surety
If a lien voidable under §547 of the Code has been dissolved by the furnishing of a bond or other
obligation and the surety thereon has been indemnified by the transfer of, or the creation of a lien
upon, nonexempt property of the debtor, the surety shall be joined as a defendant in any proceeding
to avoid the indemnifying transfer or lien. Such proceeding is governed by the rules in Part VII.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 612.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to conform to §550(a) of the Code which provides that the trustee may recover the
property transferred in a voidable transfer. The value of the property may be recovered in lieu of the property
itself only if the court so orders.
Rule 6011. Disposal of Patient Records in Health Care Business Case
(a) NOTICE BY PUBLICATION UNDER §351(1)(A). A notice regarding the claiming or
disposing of patient records under §351(1)(A) shall not identify any patient by name or other
identifying information, but shall:
(1) identify with particularity the health care facility whose patient records the trustee proposes
to destroy;
(2) state the name, address, telephone number, email address, and website, if any, of a person
from whom information about the patient records may be obtained;
(3) state how to claim the patient records; and
(4) state the date by which patient records must be claimed, and that if they are not so claimed
the records will be destroyed.
(b) NOTICE BY MAIL UNDER §351(1)(B). Subject to applicable nonbankruptcy law relating to
patient privacy, a notice regarding the claiming or disposing of patient records under §351(1)(B)
shall, in addition to including the information in subdivision (a), direct that a patient's family member
or other representative who receives the notice inform the patient of the notice. Any notice under this
subdivision shall be mailed to the patient and any family member or other contact person whose
name and address have been given to the trustee or the debtor for the purpose of providing
information regarding the patient's health care, to the Attorney General of the State where the health
care facility is located, and to any insurance company known to have provided health care insurance
to the patient.
(c) PROOF OF COMPLIANCE WITH NOTICE REQUIREMENT. Unless the court orders the
trustee to file proof of compliance with §351(1)(B) under seal, the trustee shall not file, but shall
maintain, the proof of compliance for a reasonable time.
(d) REPORT OF DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS. The trustee shall file, no later than 30 days
after the destruction of patient records under §351(3), a report certifying that the unclaimed records
have been destroyed and explaining the method used to effect the destruction. The report shall not
identify any patient by name or other identifying information.
(Added Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008
This rule is new. It implements §351(1), which was added to the Code by the 2005 amendments. That
provision requires the trustee to notify patients that their patient records will be destroyed if they remain
unclaimed for one year after the publication of a notice in an appropriate newspaper. The Code provision also
requires that individualized notice be sent to each patient and to the patient's family member or other contact
person.
[Release Point 118-106]
The variety of health care businesses and the range of current and former patients present the need for
flexibility in the creation and publication of the notices that will be given. Nevertheless, there are some
matters that must be included in any notice being given to patients, their family members, and contact persons
to ensure that sufficient information is provided to these persons regarding the trustee's intent to dispose of
patient records. Subdivision (a) of this rule lists the minimum requirements for notices given under
§351(1)(A), and subdivision (b) governs the form of notices under §351(1)(B). Notices given under this rule
are subject to provisions under applicable federal and state law that relate to the protection of patients' privacy,
such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104–191 (HIPAA).
Subdivision (c) directs the trustee to maintain proof of compliance with §351(1)(B), but because the proof
of compliance may contain patient names that should or must remain confidential, it prohibits filing the proof
of compliance unless the court orders the trustee to file it under seal.
Subdivision (d) requires the trustee to file a report with the court regarding the destruction of patient
records. This certification is intended to ensure that the trustee properly completed the destruction process.
However, because the report will be filed with the court and ordinarily will be available to the public under
§107, the names, addresses, and other identifying information of patients are not to be included in the report to
protect patient privacy.
Changes Made After Publication. Subdivision (b)(2) was amended to add the Attorney General of the State
where a health care facility is located to the list of entities entitled to notice of the disposal of patient records.
PART VII—ADVERSARY PROCEEDINGS
Rule 7001. Scope of Rules of Part VII
An adversary proceeding is governed by the rules of this Part VII. The following are adversary
proceedings:
(1) a proceeding to recover money or property, other than a proceeding to compel the debtor to
deliver property to the trustee, or a proceeding under §554(b) or §725 of the Code, Rule 2017, or
Rule 6002;
(2) a proceeding to determine the validity, priority, or extent of a lien or other interest in
property, but not a proceeding under Rule 3012 or Rule 4003(d);
(3) a proceeding to obtain approval under §363(h) for the sale of both the interest of the estate
and of a co-owner in property;
(4) a proceeding to object to or revoke a discharge, other than an objection to discharge under
§§727(a)(8), 1 (a)(9), or 1328(f);
(5) a proceeding to revoke an order of confirmation of a chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13
plan;
(6) a proceeding to determine the dischargeability of a debt;
(7) a proceeding to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief, except when a chapter 9,
chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 plan provides for the relief;
(8) a proceeding to subordinate any allowed claim or interest, except when a chapter 9, chapter
11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 plan provides for subordination;
(9) a proceeding to obtain a declaratory judgment relating to any of the foregoing; or
(10) a proceeding to determine a claim or cause of action removed under 28 U.S.C. §1452.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 26, 1999, eff.
Dec. 1, 1999; Apr. 28, 2010, eff. Dec. 1, 2010; Apr. 27, 2017, eff. Dec. 1, 2017.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
The rules in Part VII govern the procedural aspects of litigation involving the matters referred to in this
Rule 7001. Under Rule 9014 some of the Part VII rules also apply to contested matters.
These Part VII rules are based on the premise that to the extent possible practice before the bankruptcy
courts and the district courts should be the same. These rules either incorporate or are adaptations of most of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Although the Part VII rules of the former Bankruptcy Rules also relied
heavily on the F.R.Civ.P., the former Part VII rules departed from the civil practice in two significant ways: a
[Release Point 118-106]
trial or pretrial conference had to be scheduled as soon as the adversary proceeding was filed and pleadings
had to be filed within periods shorter than those established by the F.R.Civ.P. These departures from the civil
practice have been eliminated.
The content and numbering of these Part VII rules correlates to the content and numbering of the F.R.Civ.P.
Most, but not all, of the F.R.Civ.P. have a comparable Part VII rule. When there is no Part VII rule with a
number corresponding to a particular F.R.Civ.P., Parts V and IX of these rules must be consulted to determine
if one of the rules in those parts deals with the subject. The list below indicates the F.R.Civ.P., or subdivision
thereof, covered by a rule in either Part V or Part IX.

Proceedings to which the rules in Part VII apply directly include those brought to avoid transfers by the
debtor under §§544, 545, 547, 548 and 549 of the Code; subject to important exceptions, proceedings to
recover money or property; proceedings on bonds under Rules 5008(d) and 9025; proceedings under Rule
4004 to determine whether a discharge in a chapter 7 or 11 case should be denied because of an objection
grounded on §727 and proceedings in a chapter 7 or 13 case to revoke a discharge as provided in §§727(d) or
1328(e); and proceedings initiated pursuant to §523(c) of the Code to determine the dischargeability of a
particular debt. Those proceedings were classified as adversary proceedings under former Bankruptcy Rule
701.
Also included as adversary proceedings are proceedings to revoke an order of confirmation of a plan in a
chapter 11 or 13 case as provided in §§1144 and 1330, to subordinate under §510(c), other than as part of a
plan, an allowed claim or interest, and to sell under §363(h) both the interest of the estate and a co-owner in
property.
Declaratory judgments with respect to the subject matter of the various adversary proceedings are also
adversary proceedings.
Any claim or cause of action removed to a bankruptcy court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1478 is also an
adversary proceeding.
Unlike former Bankruptcy Rule 701, requests for relief from an automatic stay do not commence an
adversary proceeding. Section 362(e) of the Code and Rule 4001 establish an expedited schedule for judicial
disposition of requests for relief from the automatic stay. The formalities of the adversary proceeding process
[Release Point 118-106]
and the time for serving pleadings are not well suited to the expedited schedule. The motion practice
prescribed in Rule 4001 is best suited to such requests because the court has the flexibility to fix hearing dates
and other deadlines appropriate to the particular situation.
Clause (1) contains important exceptions. A person with an interest in property in the possession of the
trustee or debtor in possession may seek to recover or reclaim that property under §554(b) or §725 of the
Code. Since many attempts to recover or reclaim property under these two sections do not generate disputes,
application of the formalities of the Part VII Rules is not appropriate. Also excluded from adversary
proceedings is litigation arising from an examination under Rule 2017 of a debtor's payments of money or
transfers of property to an attorney representing the debtor in a case under the Code or an examination of a
superseded administration under Rule 6002.
Exemptions and objections thereto are governed by Rule 4003. Filing of proofs of claim and the allowances
thereof are governed by Rules 3001–3005, and objections to claims are governed by Rule 3007. When an
objection to a claim is joined with a demand for relief of the kind specified in this Rule 7001, the matter
becomes an adversary proceeding. See Rule 3007.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Another exception is added to clause (1). A trustee may proceed by motion to recover property from the
debtor.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Clauses (5) and (8) are amended to include chapter 12 plans.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to recognize that an adversary proceeding is not necessary to obtain injunctive or other
equitable relief that is provided for in a plan under circumstances in which substantive law permits the relief.
Other amendments are stylistic.
GAP Report on Rule 7001. No changes since publication, except for stylistic changes.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2010 AMENDMENT
Paragraph (4) of the rule is amended to create an exception for objections to discharge under §§727(a)(8),
(a)(9), and 1328(f) of the Code. Because objections to discharge on these grounds typically present issues
more easily resolved than other objections to discharge, the more formal procedures applicable to adversary
proceedings, such as commencement by a complaint, are not required. Instead, objections on these three
grounds are governed by Rule 4004(d). In an appropriate case, however, Rule 9014(c) allows the court to
order that additional provisions of Part VII of the rules apply to these matters.
Changes Made After Publication. The proposed addition of subsection (b) was deleted, and the content of
that provision was moved to Rule 4004(d). The exception in paragraph (4) of the rule was revised to refer to
objections to discharge under §§727(a)(8), (a)(9), and 1328(f) of the Code. The redesignation of the existing
rule as subdivision (a) was also deleted. The Committee Note was revised to reflect these changes.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2017 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (2) is amended to provide that the determination of the amount of a secured claim under Rule
3012, like a proceeding by the debtor to avoid a lien on or other transfer of exempt property under Rule
4003(d), does not require an adversary proceeding. The determination of the amount of a secured claim may
be sought by motion or through a chapter 12 or chapter 13 plan in accordance with Rule 3012. An adversary
proceeding continues to be required for lien avoidance not governed by Rule 4003(d).
1 So in original. Probably should be only one section symbol.
Rule 7002. References to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
Whenever a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure applicable to adversary proceedings makes reference
to another Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the reference shall be read as a reference to the Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure as modified in this Part VII.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Rules 5, 12, 13, 14, 25, 27, 30, 41 and 52 F.R.Civ.P. are made applicable to adversary proceedings by Part
VII. Each of those rules contains a cross reference to another Federal Rule; however, the Part VII rule which
[Release Point 118-106]
incorporates the cross-referenced Federal Rule modifies the Federal Rule in some way. Under this Rule 7002
the cross reference is to the Federal Rule as modified by Part VII. For example, Rule 5 F.R.Civ.P., which is
made applicable to adversary proceedings by Rule 7005, contains a reference to Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. Under this
Rule 7002, the cross reference is to Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. as modified by Rule 7004.
Rules 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19, 22, 23.2, 24–37, 41, 45, 49, 50, 52, 55, 59, 60, 62 F.R.Civ.P. are made
applicable to adversary proceedings by Part VII or generally to cases under the Code by Part IX. Each of those
Federal Rules contains a cross reference to another Federal Rule which is not modified by the Part VII or Part
IX rule which makes the cross-referenced Federal Rule applicable. Since the cross-referenced rule is not
modified by a Part VII rule this Rule 7002 does not apply.

States by first class mail postage prepaid as follows:
(1) Upon an individual other than an infant or incompetent, by mailing a copy of the summons
and complaint to the individual's dwelling house or usual place of abode or to the place where the
individual regularly conducts a business or profession.
(2) Upon an infant or an incompetent person, by mailing a copy of the summons and complaint
to the person upon whom process is prescribed to be served by the law of the state in which
service is made when an action is brought against such a defendant in the courts of general
jurisdiction of that state. The summons and complaint in that case shall be addressed to the person
required to be served at that person's dwelling house or usual place of abode or at the place where
the person regularly conducts a business or profession.
(3) Upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated
association, by mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the attention of an officer, a
managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive

United States at Washington, District of Columbia, and in any action attacking the validity of an
order of an officer or an agency of the United States not made a party, by also mailing a copy of
the summons and complaint to that officer or agency. The court shall allow a reasonable time for
service pursuant to this subdivision for the purpose of curing the failure to mail a copy of the
summons and complaint to multiple officers, agencies, or corporations of the United States if the
plaintiff has mailed a copy of the summons and complaint either to the civil process clerk at the
office of the United States attorney or to the Attorney General of the United States.
(5) Upon any officer or agency of the United States, by mailing a copy of the summons and
complaint to the United States as prescribed in paragraph (4) of this subdivision and also to the
officer or agency. If the agency is a corporation, the mailing shall be as prescribed in paragraph (3)
of this subdivision of this rule. The court shall allow a reasonable time for service pursuant to this
subdivision for the purpose of curing the failure to mail a copy of the summons and complaint to
multiple officers, agencies, or corporations of the United States if the plaintiff has mailed a copy
of the summons and complaint either to the civil process clerk at the office of the United States
attorney or to the Attorney General of the United States. If the United States trustee is the trustee
in the case and service is made upon the United States trustee solely as trustee, service may be
made as prescribed in paragraph (10) of this subdivision of this rule.
(6) Upon a state or municipal corporation or other governmental organization thereof subject to
suit, by mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the person or office upon whom process
is prescribed to be served by the law of the state in which service is made when an action is
brought against such a defendant in the courts of general jurisdiction of that state, or in the
absence of the designation of any such person or office by state law, then to the chief executive
officer thereof.
(7) Upon a defendant of any class referred to in paragraph (1) or (3) of this subdivision of this
rule, it is also sufficient if a copy of the summons and complaint is mailed to the entity upon
whom service is prescribed to be served by any statute of the United States or by the law of the
state in which service is made when an action is brought against such a defendant in the court of
general jurisdiction of that state.
(8) Upon any defendant, it is also sufficient if a copy of the summons and complaint is mailed
to an agent of such defendant authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process, at
the agent's dwelling house or usual place of abode or at the place where the agent regularly carries
on a business or profession and, if the authorization so requires, by mailing also a copy of the
summons and complaint to the defendant as provided in this subdivision.
(9) Upon the debtor, after a petition has been filed by or served upon the debtor and until the
case is dismissed or closed, by mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the debtor at the
address shown in the petition or to such other address as the debtor may designate in a filed
writing.
(10) Upon the United States trustee, when the United States trustee is the trustee in the case and
service is made upon the United States trustee solely as trustee, by mailing a copy of the summons
and complaint to an office of the United States trustee or another place designated by the United
States trustee in the district where the case under the Code is pending.
(c) SERVICE BY PUBLICATION. If a party to an adversary proceeding to determine or protect
rights in property in the custody of the court cannot be served as provided in Rule 4(e)–(j) F.R.Civ.P.
or subdivision (b) of this rule, the court may order the summons and complaint to be served by
mailing copies thereof by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the party's last known address, and by
at least one publication in such manner and form as the court may direct.
(d) NATIONWIDE SERVICE OF PROCESS. The summons and complaint and all other process
except a subpoena may be served anywhere in the United States.
(e) SUMMONS: TIME LIMIT FOR SERVICE WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. Service made
under Rule 4(e), (g), (h)(1), (i), or (j)(2) F.R.Civ.P. shall be by delivery of the summons and
[Release Point 118-106]
complaint within 7 days after the summons is issued. If service is by any authorized form of mail, the
summons and complaint shall be deposited in the mail within 7 days after the summons is issued. If a
summons is not timely delivered or mailed, another summons will be issued for service. This
subdivision does not apply to service in a foreign country.
(f) PERSONAL JURISDICTION. If the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the Constitution
and laws of the United States, serving a summons or filing a waiver of service in accordance with
this rule or the subdivisions of Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. made applicable by these rules is effective to
establish personal jurisdiction over the person of any defendant with respect to a case under the Code
or a civil proceeding arising under the Code, or arising in or related to a case under the Code.
(g) SERVICE ON DEBTOR'S ATTORNEY. If the debtor is represented by an attorney, whenever
service is made upon the debtor under this Rule, service shall also be made upon the debtor's
attorney by any means authorized under Rule 5(b) F.R.Civ.P.
(h) SERVICE OF PROCESS ON AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. Service on an
insured depository institution (as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) in a
contested matter or adversary proceeding shall be made by certified mail addressed to an officer of
the institution unless—
(1) the institution has appeared by its attorney, in which case the attorney shall be served by
first class mail;
(2) the court orders otherwise after service upon the institution by certified mail of notice of an
application to permit service on the institution by first class mail sent to an officer of the
institution designated by the institution; or
(3) the institution has waived in writing its entitlement to service by certified mail by
designating an officer to receive service.
(i) SERVICE OF PROCESS BY TITLE. This subdivision (i) applies to service on a domestic or
foreign corporation or partnership or other unincorporated association under Rule 7004(b)(3) or on
an officer of an insured depository institution under Rule 7004(h). The defendant's officer or agent
need not be correctly named in the address—or even be named—if the envelope is addressed to the
defendant's proper address and directed to the attention of the officer's or agent's position or title.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a) of the rule, by incorporation of Rule 4(a), (b), (d), (e) and (g)–(i) F.R.Civ.P., governs the
mechanics of issuance of a summons and its form, the manner of service on parties and their representatives,
and service in foreign countries.
Subdivision (b), which is the same as former Rule 704(c), authorizes service of process by first class mail
postage prepaid. This rule retains the modes of service contained in former Bankruptcy Rule 704. The former
practice, in effect since 1976, has proven satisfactory.
Subdivision (c) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 704(d)(2).
Subdivision (d). Nationwide service of process is authorized by subdivision (d).
Subdivision (e) authorizes service by delivery on individuals and corporations in foreign countries if the
party to be served is the debtor or any person required to perform the duties of the debtor and certain other
persons, the adversary proceeding involves property in the custody of the bankruptcy court, or if federal or
state law authorizes such service in a foreign country.
Subdivision (f). The requirement of former Bankruptcy Rule 704 that the summons be served within 10
days is carried over into these rules by subdivision (f).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to make Rule 4(j) F.R.Civ.P. applicable to service of the summons. If service is
not completed within 120 days of the filing of the complaint, the complaint may be dismissed.
Technical amendments are made to subdivisions (a), (b), (e), and (f) to conform to recent amendments to
[Release Point 118-106]
Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The United States trustee may serve as trustee in a case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §586(a)(2) and §§701(a)(2),
1202(a), and 1302(a) of the Code. This rule is amended to avoid the necessity of mailing copies of a summons
and complaint or other pleadings to the Attorney General and to the United States attorney when service on
the United States trustee is required only because the United States trustee is acting as a case trustee. For
example, a proceeding commenced by a creditor to dismiss a case for unreasonable delay under §707(a) is
governed by Rule 9014 which requires service on the trustee pursuant to the requirements of Rule 7004 for the
service of a summons and complaint. The Attorney General and the United States attorney would have no
interest in receiving a copy of the motion to dismiss. Mailing to the office of the United States trustee when
acting as the case trustee is sufficient in such cases.
The words "with the court" in subdivision (b)(9) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and
9001(3).
The new paragraph (10) of subdivision (b) does not affect requirements for service of process on the United
States trustee when sued or otherwise a party to a litigation unrelated to its capacity as a trustee. If a
proceeding is commenced against the United States trustee which is unrelated to the United States trustee's
role as trustee, the requirements of paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) of this rule would apply.
Subdivision (g) is added in anticipation of substantial amendment to, and restructuring of subdivisions of,
Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. Any amendment to Rule 4 will not affect service in bankruptcy cases and proceedings until
further amendment to the Bankruptcy Rules. On January 1, 1990, Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. read as follows:
RULE 4 F.R.CIV.P.
PROCESS
(a) SUMMONS: ISSUANCE. Upon the filing of the complaint the clerk shall forthwith issue a summons
and deliver the summons to the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney, who shall be responsible for prompt service
of the summons and a copy of the complaint. Upon request of the plaintiff separate or additional summons
shall issue against any defendants.
(b) SAME: FORM. The summons shall be signed by the clerk, be under the seal of the court, contain the
name of the court and the names of the parties, be directed to the defendant, state the name and address of the
plaintiff's attorney, if any, otherwise the plaintiff's address, and the time within which these rules require the
defendant to appear and defend, and shall notify the defendant that in case of the defendant's failure to do so
judgment by default will be rendered against the defendant for the relief demanded in the complaint. When,
under Rule 4(e), service is made pursuant to a statute or rule of court of a state, the summons, or notice, or
order in lieu of summons shall correspond as nearly as may be to that required by the statute or rule.
(c) SERVICE.
(1) [Not applicable.]
(2)(A) [Not applicable.]
(B) [Not applicable.]
(C) A summons and complaint may be served upon a defendant of any class referred to in paragraph
(1) or (3) of subdivision (d) of this rule—
(i) pursuant to the law of the State in which the district court is held for the service of summons or
other like process upon such defendant in an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of that
State, or
(ii) [Not applicable.]
(D) [Not applicable.]
(E) [Not applicable.]
(3) [Not applicable.]
(d) SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT: PERSON TO BE SERVED. The summons and complaint shall be
served together. The plaintiff shall furnish the person making service with such copies as are necessary.
Service shall be made as follows:
(1) Upon an individual other than an infant or an incompetent person, by delivering a copy of the
summons and of the complaint to the individual personally or by leaving copies thereof at the individual's
dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing
therein or by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to an agent authorized by appointment
or by law to receive service of process.
(2) Upon an infant or an incompetent person, by serving the summons and complaint in the manner
prescribed by the law of the state in which the service is made for the service of summons or other like
[Release Point 118-106]
process upon any such defendant in an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of that state.
(3) Upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association
which is subject to suit under a common name, by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint
to an officer, a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to
receive service of process and, if the agent is one authorized by statute to receive service and the statute so
requires, by also mailing a copy to the defendant.
(4) Upon the United States, by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the United
States attorney for the district in which the action is brought or to an assistant United States attorney or
clerical employee designated by the United States attorney in a writing filed with the clerk of the court and
by sending a copy of the summons and of the complaint by registered or certified mail to the Attorney
General of the United States at Washington, District of Columbia, and in any action attacking the validity of
an order of an officer or agency of the United States not made a party, by also sending a copy of the
summons and of the complaint by registered or certified mail to such officer or agency.
(5) Upon an officer or agency of the United States, by serving the United States and by sending a copy
of the summons and of the complaint by registered or certified mail to such officer or agency. If the agency
is a corporation the copy shall be delivered as provided in paragraph (3) of this subdivision of this rule.
(6) Upon a state or municipal corporation or other governmental organization thereof subject to suit,
by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the chief executive officer thereof or by
serving the summons and complaint in the manner prescribed by the law of that state for the service of
summons or other like process upon any such defendant.
(e) SUMMONS: SERVICE UPON PARTY NOT INHABITANT OF OR FOUND WITHIN STATE.
Whenever a statute of the United States or an order of court thereunder provides for service of a summons, or
of a notice, or of an order in lieu of summons upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state in
which the district court is held, service may be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed by
the statute or order, or, if there is no provision therein prescribing the manner of service, in a manner stated in
this rule. Whenever a statute or rule of court of the state in which the district court is held provides (1) for
service of a summons, or of a notice, or of an order in lieu of summons upon a party not an inhabitant of or
found within the state, or (2) for service upon or notice to such a party to appear and respond or defend in an
action by reason of the attachment or garnishment or similar seizure of the party's property located within the
state, service may in either case be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed in the statute
or rule.
(f) [Not applicable.]
(g) RETURN. The person serving the process shall make proof of service thereof to the court promptly and
in any event within the time during which the person served must respond to the process. If service is made by
a person other than a United States marshal or deputy United States marshal, such person shall make affidavit
thereof. If service is made under subdivision (c)(2)(C)(ii) of this rule, return shall be made by the sender's
filing with the court the acknowledgment received pursuant to such subdivision. Failure to make proof of
service does not affect the validity of the service.
(h) AMENDMENT. At any time in its discretion and upon such terms as it deems just, the court may allow
any process or proof of service thereof to be amended, unless it clearly appears that material prejudice would
result to the substantial rights of the party against whom the process issued.
(i) ALTERNATIVE PROVISIONS FOR SERVICE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY.
(1) Manner. When the federal or state law referred to in subdivision (e) of this rule authorizes service
upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state in which the district court is held, and service is
to be effected upon the party in a foreign country, it is also sufficient if service of the summons and
complaint is made: (A) in the manner prescribed by the law of the foreign country for service in that
country in an action in any of its courts of general jurisdiction; or (B) as directed by the foreign authority in
response to a letter rogatory, when service in either case is reasonably calculated to give actual notice; or
(C) upon an individual, by delivery to the individual personally, and upon a corporation or partnership or
association, by delivery to an officer, a managing or general agent; or (D) by any form of mail, requiring a
signed receipt, to be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the party to be served; or (E) as
directed by order of the court. Service under (C) or (E) above may be made by any person who is not a
party and is not less than 18 years of age or who is designated by order of the district court or by the foreign
court. On request, the clerk shall deliver the summons to the plaintiff for transmission to the person or the
foreign court or officer who will make the service.
(2) Return. Proof of service may be made as prescribed by subdivision (g) of this rule, or by the law of
the foreign country, or by order of the court. When service is made pursuant to subparagraph (1)(D) of this
subdivision, proof of service shall include a receipt signed by the addressee or other evidence of delivery to
[Release Point 118-106]
the addressee satisfactory to the court.
(j) SUMMONS: TIME LIMIT FOR SERVICE. If a service of the summons and complaint is not made
upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint and the party on whose behalf such service
was required cannot show good cause why such service was not made within that period, the action shall be
dismissed as to that defendant without prejudice upon the court's own initiative with notice to such party or
upon motion. This subdivision shall not apply to service in a foreign country pursuant to subdivision (i) of this
rule.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1996 AMENDMENT
The purpose of these amendments is to conform the rule to the 1993 revisions of Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. and to
make stylistic improvements. Rule 7004, as amended, continues to provide for service by first class mail as an
alternative to the methods of personal service provided in Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P., except as provided in the new
subdivision (h).
Rule 4(d)(2) F.R.Civ.P. provides a procedure by which the plaintiff may request by first class mail that the
defendant waive service of the summons. This procedure is not applicable in adversary proceedings because it
is not necessary in view of the availability of service by mail pursuant to Rule 7004(b). However, if a written
waiver of service of a summons is made in an adversary proceeding, Rule 4(d)(1) F.R.Civ.P. applies so that
the defendant does not thereby waive any objection to the venue or the jurisdiction of the court over the
person of the defendant.
Subdivisions (b)(4) and (b)(5) are amended to conform to the 1993 amendments to Rule 4(i)(3) F.R.Civ.P.,
which protect the plaintiff from the hazard of losing a substantive right because of failure to comply with the
requirements of multiple service when the United States or an officer, agency, or corporation of the United
States is a defendant. These subdivisions also are amended to require that the summons and complaint be
addressed to the civil process clerk at the office of the United States attorney.
Subdivision (e), which has governed service in a foreign country, is abrogated and Rule 4(f) and (h)(2)
F.R.Civ.P., as substantially revised in 1993, are made applicable in adversary proceedings.
The new subdivision (f) is consistent with the 1993 amendments to F.R.Civ.P. 4(k)(2). It clarifies that
service or filing a waiver of service in accordance with this rule or the applicable subdivisions of F.R.Civ.P. 4
is sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over the defendant. See the committee note to the 1993
amendments to Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P.
Subdivision (g) is abrogated. This subdivision was promulgated in 1991 so that anticipated revisions to Rule
4 F.R.Civ.P. would not affect service of process in adversary proceedings until further amendment to Rule
7004.
Subdivision (h) and the first phrase of subdivision (b) were added by §114 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of
1994, Pub. L. No. 103–394, 108 Stat. 4106.
GAP Report on Rule 7004. After publication of the proposed amendments, Rule 7004(b) was amended and
Rule 7004(h) was added by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 to provide for service by certified mail on an
insured depository institution. The above draft includes those statutory amendments (without underlining new
language or striking former language). No other changes have been made since publication, except for stylistic
changes.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (e) is amended so that the ten-day time limit for service of a summons does not apply if the
summons is served in a foreign country.
GAP Report on Rule 7004. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2005 AMENDMENT
This amendment specifically authorizes the clerk to issue a summons electronically. In some bankruptcy
cases the trustee or debtor in possession may commence hundreds of adversary proceedings simultaneously,
and permitting the electronic signing and sealing of the summonses for those proceedings increases the
efficiency of the clerk's office without any negative impact on any party. The rule only authorizes electronic
issuance of the summons. It does not address the service requirements for the summons. Those requirements
are set out elsewhere in Rule 7004, and nothing in Rule 7004(a)(2) should be construed as authorizing
electronic service of a summons.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2006 AMENDMENT
Under current Rule 7004, an entity may serve a summons and complaint upon the debtor by personal
service or by mail. If the entity chooses to serve the debtor by mail, it must also serve a copy of the summons
[Release Point 118-106]
and complaint on the debtor's attorney by mail. If the entity effects personal service on the debtor, there is no
requirement that the debtor's attorney also be served.
Subdivision (b)(9). The rule is amended to delete the reference in subdivision (b)(9) to the debtor's address
as set forth in the statement of financial affairs. In 1991, the Official Form of the statement of financial affairs
was revised and no longer includes a question regarding the debtor's current residence. Since that time,
Official Form 1, the petition, has required the debtor to list both the debtor's residence and mailing address.
Therefore, the subdivision is amended to delete the statement of financial affairs as a document that might
contain an address at which the debtor can be served.
Subdivision (g). The rule is amended to require service on the debtor's attorney whenever the debtor is
served with a summons and complaint. The amendment makes this change by deleting that portion of Rule
7004(b)(9) that requires service on the debtor's attorney when the debtor is served by mail, and relocates the
obligation to serve the debtor's attorney into new subdivision (g). Service on the debtor's attorney is not
limited to mail service, but may be accomplished by any means permitted under Rule 5(b) F.R.Civ.P.
Changes Made After Publication. The Committee Note was amended to add the final [second] paragraph of
the Note. The new paragraph describes the reason for the deletion of the reference in the rule to the statement
of affairs as a source for the debtor's address. This was a secondary reason for amending the rule, and even in
the absence of public comment on the proposed amendment, the Advisory Committee believes that the
additional explanation in the Committee Note is appropriate.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (e) is amended to alter the period of time during which service of the summons and complaint
must be made. The amendment reduces that period from fourteen days to seven days after issuance of the
summons. Because Rule 7012 provides that the defendant's time to answer the complaint is calculated from
the date the summons is issued, a lengthy delay between issuance and service of the summons may unduly
shorten the defendant's time to respond. The amendment is therefore intended to encourage prompt service
after issuance of a summons. If service of the summons within any seven-day period is impracticable, a court
retains the discretion to enlarge that period of time under Rule 9006(b).
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. A new sentence referring to the availability of an
enlargement of time under Rule 9006(b) was added to the Committee Note. The only other change made after
publication and comment was stylistic.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
In 1996, Rule 7004(a) was amended to incorporate by reference F.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(1). Civil Rule 4(d)(1)
addresses the effect of a defendant's waiver of service. In 2007, Civil Rule 4 was amended, and the language
of old Civil Rule 4(d)(1) was modified and renumbered as Civil Rule 4(d)(5). Accordingly, Rule 7004(a) is
amended to update the cross-reference to Civil Rule 4.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
New Rule 7004(i) is intended to reject those cases interpreting Rule 7004(b)(3) and Rule 7004(h) to require
service on a named officer, managing or general agent or other agent, rather than use of their titles. Service to
a corporation or partnership, unincorporated association or insured depository institution at its proper address
directed to the attention of the "Chief Executive Officer," "President," "Officer for Receiving Service of
Process," "Managing Agent," "General Agent," "Officer," or "Agent for Receiving Service of Process" (or
other similar titles) is sufficient.

Rule 7007.1. Corporate Ownership Statement
(a) REQUIRED DISCLOSURE. Any nongovernmental corporation that is a party to an adversary
proceeding, other than the debtor, shall file a statement that identifies any parent corporation and any
publicly held corporation that owns 10% or more of its stock or states that there is no such
corporation. The same requirement applies to a nongovernmental corporation that seeks to intervene.
(b) TIME FOR FILING; SUPPLEMENTAL FILING. The corporate ownership statement shall:
(1) be filed with the corporation's first appearance, pleading, motion, response, or other request
addressed to the court; and
(2) be supplemented whenever the information required by this rule changes.
(Added Mar. 27, 2003, eff. Dec. 1, 2003; amended Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007; Apr. 14, 2021,
eff. Dec. 1, 2021.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2003
This rule is derived from Rule 26.1 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The information that
parties shall supply will support properly informed disqualification decisions in situations that call for
automatic disqualification under Canon 3C(1)(c) of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. This rule
does not cover all of the circumstances that may call for disqualification under the subjective financial interest
standard of Canon 3C, and does not deal at all with other circumstances that may call for disqualification.
Nevertheless, the required disclosures are calculated to reach the majority of circumstances that are likely to
call for disqualification under Canon 3C(1)(c).
The rule directs nongovernmental corporate parties to list those corporations that hold significant ownership
[Release Point 118-106]
interests in them. This includes listing membership interests in limited liability companies and similar entities
that fall under the definition of a corporation in Bankruptcy Code §101.
Under subdivision (b), parties must file the statement with the first document that they file in any adversary
proceeding. The rule also requires parties and other persons to file supplemental statements promptly
whenever changed circumstances require disclosure of new or additional information.
The rule does not prohibit the adoption of local rules requiring disclosures beyond those called for in Rule
7007.1.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2007 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to clarify that a party must file a corporate ownership statement with its initial paper
filed with the court in an adversary proceeding. The party's initial filing may be a document that is not a
"pleading" as defined in Rule 7 F. R. Civ. P., which is made applicable in adversary proceedings by Rule
7007. The amendment also brings Rule 7007.1 more closely in line with Rule 7.1 F. R. Civ. P.
Changes After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2021 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to conform to recent amendments to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8012 and Fed. R. App. P. 26.1,
and the anticipated amendment to Fed. R. Civ. P. 7.1. Subdivision (a) is amended to encompass
nongovernmental corporations that seek to intervene. Stylistic changes are made to subdivision (b) to reflect
that some statements will be filed by nonparties seeking to intervene.
Rule 7008. General Rules of Pleading
Rule 8 F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings. The allegation of jurisdiction required by Rule
8(a) shall also contain a reference to the name, number, and chapter of the case under the Code to
which the adversary proceeding relates and to the district and division where the case under the Code
is pending. In an adversary proceeding before a bankruptcy court, the complaint, counterclaim,
cross-claim, or third-party complaint shall contain a statement that the pleader does or does not
consent to entry of final orders or judgment by the bankruptcy court.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; Apr. 28, 2016, eff.
Dec. 1, 2016.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Proceedings before a bankruptcy judge are either core or non-core. 28 U.S.C. §157. A bankruptcy judge
may enter a final order or judgment in a core proceeding. In a non-core proceeding, absent consent of the
parties, the bankruptcy judge may not enter a final order or judgment but may only submit proposed findings
of fact and conclusions of law to the district judge who will enter the final order or judgment. 28 U.S.C.
§157(c)(1). The amendment to subdivision (a) of this rule requires an allegation as to whether a proceeding is
core or non-core. A party who alleges that the proceeding is non-core shall state whether the party does or
does not consent to the entry of a final order or judgment by the bankruptcy judge. Failure to include the
statement of consent does not constitute consent. Only express consent in the pleadings or otherwise is
effective to authorize entry of a final order or judgment by the bankruptcy judge in a non-core proceeding.
Amendments to Rule 7012 require that the defendant admit or deny the allegation as to whether the
proceeding is core or non-core.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to delete subdivision (b), which required a request for attorney's fees always to be
pleaded as a claim in an allowed pleading. That requirement, which differed from the practice under the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, had the potential to serve as a trap for the unwary.
The procedures for seeking an award of attorney's fees are now set out in Rule 7054(b)(2), which makes
applicable most of the provisions of Rule 54(d)(2) F.R.Civ.P. As specified by Rule 54(d)(2)(A) and (B)
F.R.Civ.P., a claim for attorney's fees must be made by a motion filed no later than 14 days after entry of the
judgment unless the governing substantive law requires those fees to be proved at trial as an element of
damages. When fees are an element of damages, such as when the terms of a contract provide for the recovery
of fees incurred prior to the instant adversary proceeding, the general pleading requirements of this rule still
apply.

Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2016 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to remove the requirement that the pleader state whether the proceeding is core or
non-core and to require in all proceedings that the pleader state whether the party does or does not consent to
the entry of final orders or judgment by the bankruptcy court. Some proceedings that satisfy the statutory
definition of core proceedings, 28 U.S.C. §157(b)(2), may remain beyond the constitutional power of a
bankruptcy judge to adjudicate finally. The amended rule calls for the pleader to make a statement regarding
consent, whether or not a proceeding is termed non-core. Rule 7012(b) has been amended to require a similar
statement in a responsive pleading. The bankruptcy judge will then determine the appropriate course of
proceedings under Rule 7016.

Rule 7012. Defenses and Objections—When and How Presented—By Pleading or
Motion—Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
(a) WHEN PRESENTED. If a complaint is duly served, the defendant shall serve an answer
within 30 days after the issuance of the summons, except when a different time is prescribed by the
court. The court shall prescribe the time for service of the answer when service of a complaint is
made by publication or upon a party in a foreign country. A party served with a pleading stating a
cross-claim shall serve an answer thereto within 21 days after service. The plaintiff shall serve a
reply to a counterclaim in the answer within 21 days after service of the answer or, if a reply is
ordered by the court, within 21 days after service of the order, unless the order otherwise directs. The
United States or an officer or agency thereof shall serve an answer to a complaint within 35 days
after the issuance of the summons, and shall serve an answer to a cross-claim, or a reply to a
counterclaim, within 35 days after service upon the United States attorney of the pleading in which
the claim is asserted. The service of a motion permitted under this rule alters these periods of time as
follows, unless a different time is fixed by order of the court: (1) if the court denies the motion or
postpones its disposition until the trial on the merits, the responsive pleading shall be served within
[Release Point 118-106]
14 days after notice of the court's action; (2) if the court grants a motion for a more definite
statement, the responsive pleading shall be served within 14 days after the service of a more definite
statement.
(b) APPLICABILITY OF RULE 12(b)–(i) F.R.CIV.P. Rule 12(b)–(i) F.R.Civ.P. applies in

not consent to entry of final orders or judgment by the bankruptcy court.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a) continues the practice of former Bankruptcy Rule 712(a) by requiring that the answer to a
complaint be filed within 30 days after the issuance of the summons. Under Rule 7004(f), the summons must
be served within 10 days of issuance. The other pleading periods in adversary proceedings are the same as
those in civil actions before the district courts, except that the United States is allowed 35 rather than 60 days
to respond.
Rule 12(b)(7) and (h)(2) F.R.Civ.P. refers to Rule 19 F.R.Civ.P. Pursuant to Rule 7002 these references are

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
The amendment to subdivision (b) requires a response to the allegation that the proceeding is core or
non-core. A final order of judgment may not be entered in a non-core proceeding heard by a bankruptcy judge
unless all parties expressly consent. 28 U.S.C. §157(c).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to conform to the changes made to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure through the
restyling of those rules effective on December 1, 2007.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2016 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is amended to remove the requirement that the pleader state whether the proceeding is core
or non-core and to require in all proceedings that the pleader state whether the party does or does not consent
to the entry of final orders or judgment by the bankruptcy court. The amended rule also removes the provision
requiring express consent before the entry of final orders and judgments in non-core proceedings. Some
proceedings that satisfy the statutory definition of core proceedings, 28 U.S.C. §157(b)(2), may remain
beyond the constitutional power of a bankruptcy judge to adjudicate finally. The amended rule calls for the
pleader to make a statement regarding consent, whether or not a proceeding is termed non-core. This
amendment complements the requirements of amended Rule 7008(a). The bankruptcy judge's subsequent
determination of the appropriate course of proceedings, including whether to enter final orders and judgments
or to issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, is a pretrial matter now provided for in amended
Rule 7016.

trustee or debtor in possession who fails to plead a counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect, or when justice so requires, may by leave of court amend the pleading, or
commence a new adversary proceeding or separate action.

sustained, the court shall dismiss such entity from the adversary proceedings and (2) if an entity
joined as a party properly and timely raises the defense of improper venue, the court shall determine,
as provided in 28 U.S.C. §1412, whether that part of the proceeding involving the joined party shall
be transferred to another district, or whether the entire adversary proceeding shall be transferred to
another district.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule addresses a situation different from that encountered by the district court when its jurisdiction is
based on diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. §1332. Joining of a party whose citizenship is the same as
that of an adversary destroys the district court's jurisdiction over the entire civil action but under 28 U.S.C.
§1471 the attempted joinder of such a person would not affect the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction over the
original adversary proceeding.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT

containing terms and conditions which the court deems proper.
(As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Dismissal of a complaint objecting to a discharge raises special concerns because the plaintiff may have
been induced to dismiss by an advantage given or promised by the debtor or someone acting in his interest.
Some courts by local rule or order have required the debtor and his attorney or the plaintiff to file an affidavit
that nothing has been promised to the plaintiff in consideration of the withdrawal of the objection. By
specifically authorizing the court to impose conditions in the order of dismissal this rule permits the
continuation of this salutary practice.
Rule 41 F.R.Civ.P. refers to Rule 19 F.R.Civ.P. Pursuant to Rule 7002 that reference is to Rule 19
[Release Point 118-106]

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The United States trustee has standing to object to the debtor's discharge pursuant to §727(c) and may have
refrained from commencing an adversary proceeding objecting to discharge within the time limits provided in
Rule 4004 only because another party commenced such a proceeding. The United States trustee may oppose
dismissal of the original proceeding.
The rule is also amended to clarify that the court may direct that other persons receive notice of a plaintiff's
motion to dismiss a complaint objecting to discharge.

judgment. In these proceedings, the reference in Rule 52 F.R.Civ.P. to the entry of judgment under
Rule 58 F.R.Civ.P. shall be read as a reference to the entry of a judgment or order under Rule
5003(a).

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Rule 52(a) F.R.Civ.P. refers to Rule 12 F.R.Civ.P. Pursuant to Rule 7002 this reference is to Rule 12
F.R.Civ.P. as incorporated and modified by Rule 7012.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended by limiting the time for filing post judgment motions for amended or additional
findings. In 2009, Rule 52 F. R. Civ. P. was amended to extend the deadline for filing those post judgment
motions to no later than 28 days after entry of the judgment. That deadline corresponds to the 30-day deadline
for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case under Rule 4(a)(1)(A) F. R. App. P. In a bankruptcy case, the
deadline for filing a notice of appeal is 14 days. Therefore, the 28-day deadline for filing a motion for
amended or additional findings would effectively override the notice of appeal deadline under Rule 8002(a)
but for this amendment.
The rule is amended to clarify that the reference in Rule 52 F. R. Civ. P. to Rule 58 F. R. Civ. P. and its
provisions is construed as a reference to the entry of a judgment or order under Rule 5003(a).

COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2012 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) is amended to provide more time for a party to respond to the prevailing
party's bill of costs. The former rule's provision of one day's notice was unrealistically short. The change to 14
days conforms to the change made to Civil Rule 54(d). Extension from five to seven days of the time for
serving a motion for court review of the clerk's action implements changes in connection with the December
1, 2009, amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. Throughout
the rules, deadlines have been amended in the following manner:
• 5-day periods became 7-day periods.
• 10-day periods became 14-day periods.

content, and the previously existing provision governing costs is renumbered as paragraph (1) and re-titled.
As provided in Rule 54(d)(2)(A), new subsection (b)(2) does not apply to fees recoverable as an element of
damages, as when sought under the terms of a contract providing for the recovery of fees incurred prior to the
instant adversary proceeding. Such fees typically are required to be claimed in a pleading.
Rule 54(d)(2)(D) F.R.Civ.P. does not apply in adversary proceedings insofar as it authorizes the referral of
fee matters to a master or a magistrate judge. The use of masters is not authorized in bankruptcy cases, see
Rule 9031, and 28 U.S.C. §636 does not authorize a magistrate judge to exercise jurisdiction upon referral by
a bankruptcy judge. The remaining provision of Rule 54(d)(2)(D) is expressed in subdivision (b)(2)(B) of this
rule.
Rule 54(d)(2)(C) refers to Rule 78 F.R.Civ.P., which is not applicable in adversary proceedings.
Accordingly, that reference is not incorporated by this rule.

COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2012 AMENDMENT
The only exception to complete adoption of Rule 56 F.R.Civ.P. involves the default deadline for filing a
summary judgment motion. Rule 56(c)(1)(A) makes the default deadline 30 days after the close of all
discovery. Because in bankruptcy cases hearings can occur shortly after the close of discovery, a default
deadline based on the scheduled hearing date, rather than the close of discovery, is adopted. As with Rule
56(c)(1), the deadline can be altered either by local rule or court order.

PART VIII—APPEALS TO DISTRICT COURT OR BANKRUPTCY
1
APPELLATE PANEL
LENGTH LIMITS STATED IN PART VIII OF THE FEDERAL RULES OF BANKRUPTCY
PROCEDURE
For the length limits stated in this part, see the Appendix, set out following the Official Forms following
Part X of these rules.
1 The 2014 amendments to Part VIII of the Bankruptcy Rules are comprehensive. Proposed
amendment of the heading, "Part VIII. Bankruptcy Appeals", was not transmitted for
Congressional review.
Rule 8001. Scope of Part VIII Rules; Definition of "BAP"; Method of
Transmission
(a) GENERAL SCOPE. These Part VIII rules govern the procedure in a United States district
court and a bankruptcy appellate panel on appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy
court. They also govern certain procedures on appeal to a United States court of appeals under 28
U.S.C. §158(d).
[Release Point 118-106]
(b) DEFINITION OF "BAP." "BAP" means a bankruptcy appellate panel established by a circuit's
judicial council and authorized to hear appeals from a bankruptcy court under 28 U.S.C. §158.
(c) METHOD OF TRANSMITTING DOCUMENTS. A document must be sent electronically
under these Part VIII rules, unless it is being sent by or to an individual who is not represented by
counsel or the court's governing rules permit or require mailing or other means of delivery.
(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
PRIOR RULE
A prior Rule 8001, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30,
1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997; Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; Mar. 26, 2009, eff.
Dec. 1, 2009, related to manner of taking appeal, voluntary dismissal, and certification to court of appeals,
prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
These Part VIII rules apply to appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(a) from bankruptcy courts to district courts and
BAPs. The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure generally govern bankruptcy appeals to courts of appeals.
Eight of the Part VIII rules do, however, relate to appeals to courts of appeals. Rule 8004(e) provides that
the authorization by a court of appeals of a direct appeal of a bankruptcy court's interlocutory order or decree
constitutes a grant of leave to appeal. Rule 8006 governs the procedure for certification under 28 U.S.C.
§158(d)(2) of a direct appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to a court of appeals.
Rule 8007 addresses stays pending a direct appeal to a court of appeals. Rule 8008 authorizes a bankruptcy
court to issue an indicative ruling while an appeal is pending in a court of appeals. Rules 8009 and 8010
govern the record on appeal in a direct appeal to a court of appeals. Rule 8025 governs the granting of a stay
of a district court or BAP judgment pending an appeal to the court of appeals. And Rule 8028 authorizes the
court of appeals to suspend applicable Part VIII rules in a particular case, subject to certain enumerated
exceptions.
These rules take account of the evolving technology in the federal courts for the electronic filing, storage,
and transmission of documents. Except as applied to pro se parties, the Part VIII rules require documents to be
sent electronically, unless applicable court rules or orders expressly require or permit another means of
sending a particular document.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
Rule 8002. Time for Filing Notice of Appeal
(a) IN GENERAL.
(1) Fourteen-Day Period. Except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c), a notice of appeal
must be filed with the bankruptcy clerk within 14 days after entry of the judgment, order, or
decree being appealed.
(2) Filing Before the Entry of Judgment. A notice of appeal filed after the bankruptcy court
announces a decision or order—but before entry of the judgment, order, or decree—is treated as
filed on the date of and after the entry.
(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party files a timely notice of appeal, any other party may file a
notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was filed, or within the time
otherwise allowed by this rule, whichever period ends later.
(4) Mistaken Filing in Another Court. If a notice of appeal is mistakenly filed in a district court,
BAP, or court of appeals, the clerk of that court must state on the notice the date on which it was
received and transmit it to the bankruptcy clerk. The notice of appeal is then considered filed in
the bankruptcy court on the date so stated.
(5) Entry Defined.
(A) A judgment, order, or decree is entered for purposes of this Rule 8002(a):
(i) when it is entered in the docket under Rule 5003(a), or
(ii) if Rule 7058 applies and Rule 58(a) F.R.Civ.P. requires a separate document, when the
judgment, order, or decree is entered in the docket under Rule 5003(a) and when the earlier
of these events occurs:
• the judgment, order, or decree is set out in a separate document; or
[Release Point 118-106]
• 150 days have run from entry of the judgment, order, or decree in the docket under
Rule 5003(a).
(B) A failure to set out a judgment, order, or decree in a separate document when required by
Rule 58(a) F.R.Civ.P. does not affect the validity of an appeal from that judgment, order, or
decree.
(b) EFFECT OF A MOTION ON THE TIME TO APPEAL.
(1) In General. If a party files in the bankruptcy court any of the following motions and does so
within the time allowed by these rules, the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry
of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion:
(A) to amend or make additional findings under Rule 7052, whether or not granting the
motion would alter the judgment;
(B) to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 9023;
(C) for a new trial under Rule 9023; or
(D) for relief under Rule 9024 if the motion is filed within 14 days after the judgment is
entered.
(2) Filing an Appeal Before the Motion is Decided. If a party files a notice of appeal after the
court announces or enters a judgment, order, or decree—but before it disposes of any motion listed
in subdivision (b)(1)—the notice becomes effective when the order disposing of the last such
remaining motion is entered.
(3) Appealing the Ruling on the Motion. If a party intends to challenge an order disposing of
any motion listed in subdivision (b)(1)—or the alteration or amendment of a judgment, order, or
decree upon the motion—the party must file a notice of appeal or an amended notice of appeal.
The notice or amended notice must comply with Rule 8003 or 8004 and be filed within the time
prescribed by this rule, measured from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining
motion.
(4) No Additional Fee. No additional fee is required to file an amended notice of appeal.
(c) APPEAL BY AN INMATE CONFINED IN AN INSTITUTION.
(1) In General. If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, an inmate confined there
must use that system to receive the benefit of this Rule 8002(c)(1). If an inmate files a notice of
appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court, the notice is timely if it is
deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing and:
(A) it is accompanied by:
(i) a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. §1746—or a notarized statement—setting
out the date of deposit and stating that first-class postage is being prepaid; or
(ii) evidence (such as a postmark or date stamp) showing that the notice was so deposited
and that postage was prepaid; or
(B) the appellate court exercises its discretion to permit the later filing of a declaration or
notarized statement that satisfies Rule 8002(c)(1)(A)(i).
(2) Multiple Appeals. If an inmate files under this subdivision the first notice of appeal, the
14-day period provided in subdivision (a)(3) for another party to file a notice of appeal runs from
the date when the bankruptcy clerk dockets the first notice.
(d) EXTENDING THE TIME TO APPEAL.
(1) When the Time May be Extended. Except as provided in subdivision (d)(2), the bankruptcy
court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal upon a party's motion that is filed:
(A) within the time prescribed by this rule; or
(B) within 21 days after that time, if the party shows excusable neglect.
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) When the Time May Not be Extended. The bankruptcy court may not extend the time to file
a notice of appeal if the judgment, order, or decree appealed from:
(A) grants relief from an automatic stay under §362, 922, 1201, or 1301 of the Code;
(B) authorizes the sale or lease of property or the use of cash collateral under §363 of the
Code;
(C) authorizes the obtaining of credit under §364 of the Code;
(D) authorizes the assumption or assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease
under §365 of the Code;
(E) approves a disclosure statement under §1125 of the Code; or
(F) confirms a plan under §943, 1129, 1225, or 1325 of the Code.
(3) Time Limits on an Extension. No extension of time may exceed 21 days after the time
prescribed by this rule, or 14 days after the order granting the motion to extend time is entered,
whichever is later.

COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8002 and F.R.App.P. 4(a) and (c). With the exception of subdivision
(c), the changes to the former rule are stylistic. The rule retains the former rule's 14-day time period for filing
a notice of appeal, as opposed to the longer periods permitted for appeals in civil cases under F.R.App.P. 4(a).
Subdivision (a) continues to allow any other party to file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the first
notice of appeal is filed, or thereafter to the extent otherwise authorized by this rule. Subdivision (a) also
retains provisions of the former rule that prescribe the date the notice of appeal is deemed filed if the appellant
files it prematurely or in the wrong court.
Subdivision (b), like former Rule 8002(b) and F.R.App.P. 4(a), tolls the time for filing a notice of appeal
when certain postjudgment motions are filed, and it prescribes the effective date of a notice of appeal that is
filed before the court disposes of all of the specified motions. As under the former rule, a party that wants to
appeal the court's disposition of the motion or the alteration or amendment of a judgment, order, or decree in
response to such a motion must file a notice of appeal or, if it has already filed one, an amended notice of
appeal.
Although Rule 8003(a)(3)(C) requires a notice of appeal to be accompanied by the required fee, no
additional fee is required for the filing of an amended notice of appeal.
Subdivision (c) mirrors the provisions of F.R.App.P. 4(c)(1) and (2), which specify timing rules for a notice
of appeal filed by an inmate confined in an institution.
Subdivision (d) continues to allow the court to grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal, except
with respect to certain specified judgments, orders, and decrees.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Stylistic changes were made to the title of subdivision
(b)(3) and to subdivision (c)(1).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
Clarifying amendments are made to subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) of the rule. They are modeled on parallel
provisions of F.R.App.P. 4.
Paragraph (5) is added to subdivision (a) to clarify the effect of the separate-document requirement of
F.R.Civ.P. 58(a) on the entry of a judgment, order, or decree for the purpose of determining the time for filing
a notice of appeal.
Rule 7058 adopts F.R.Civ.P. 58 for adversary proceedings. If Rule 58(a) requires a judgment to be set out
in a separate document, the time for filing a notice of appeal runs—subject to subdivisions (b) and (c)—from
when the judgment is docketed and the judgment is set out in a separate document or, if no separate document
is prepared, from 150 days from when the judgment is entered in the docket. The court's failure to comply
with the separate-document requirement of Rule 58(a), however, does not affect the validity of an appeal.
[Release Point 118-106]
Rule 58 does not apply in contested matters. Instead, under Rule 9021, a separate document is not required,
and a judgment or order is effective when it is entered in the docket. The time for filing a notice of appeal
under subdivision (a) therefore begins to run upon docket entry in contested matters, as well as in adversary
proceedings for which Rule 58 does not require a separate document.
A clarifying amendment is made to subdivision (b)(1) to conform to a recent amendment to F.R.App.P.
4(a)(4)—from which Rule 8002(b)(1) is derived. Former Rule 8002(b)(1) provided that "[i]f a party timely
files in the bankruptcy court" certain post-judgment motions, "the time to file an appeal runs for all parties
from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion." Responding to a circuit split
concerning the meaning of "timely" in F.R.App.P. 4(a)(4), the amendment adopts the majority approach and
rejects the approach taken in National Ecological Foundation v. Alexander, 496 F.3d 466 (6th Cir. 2007). A
motion made after the time allowed by the Bankruptcy Rules will not qualify as a motion that, under Rule
8002(b)(1), re-starts the appeal time—and that fact is not altered by, for example, a court order that sets a due
date that is later than permitted by the Bankruptcy Rules, another party's consent or failure to object to the
motion's lateness, or the court's disposition of the motion without explicit reliance on untimeliness.
Subdivision (c)(1) is revised to conform to F.R.App.P. 4(c)(1), which was recently amended to streamline
and clarify the operation of the inmate-filing rule. The rule requires the inmate to show timely deposit and
prepayment of postage. It is amended to specify that a notice is timely if it is accompanied by a declaration or
notarized statement stating the date the notice was deposited in the institution's mail system and attesting to
the prepayment of first-class postage. The declaration must state that first-class postage "is being prepaid,";
not (as directed by the former rule) that first-class postage "has been prepaid." This change reflects the fact
that inmates may need to rely upon the institution to affix postage after the inmate has deposited the document
in the institution's mail system. A new Director's Form sets out a suggested form of the declaration.
The amended rule also provides that a notice is timely without a declaration or notarized statement if other
evidence accompanying the notice shows that the notice was deposited on or before the due date and that
postage was prepaid. If the notice is not accompanied by evidence that establishes timely deposit and
prepayment of postage, then the appellate court—district court, BAP, or court of appeals in the case of a direct
appeal—has discretion to accept a declaration or notarized statement at a later date. The rule uses the phrase
"exercises its discretion to permit"—rather than simply "permits"—to help ensure that pro se inmates are
aware that a court will not necessarily forgive a failure to provide the declaration initially.
REFERENCES IN TEXT
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, referred to in subd. (a)(5)(A)(ii), (B), are set out in the Appendix to
Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure.
Rule 8003. Appeal as of Right—How Taken; Docketing the Appeal
(a) FILING THE NOTICE OF APPEAL.
(1) In General. An appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to a district
court or BAP under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(1) or (a)(2) may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal
with the bankruptcy clerk within the time allowed by Rule 8002.
(2) Effect of Not Taking Other Steps. An appellant's failure to take any step other than the timely
filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for the
district court or BAP to act as it considers appropriate, including dismissing the appeal.
(3) Contents. The notice of appeal must:
(A) conform substantially to the appropriate Official Form;
(B) be accompanied by the judgment—or the appealable order or decree—from which the
appeal is taken; and
(C) be accompanied by the prescribed fee.
(4) Merger. The notice of appeal encompasses all orders that, for purposes of appeal, merge into
the identified judgment or appealable order or decree. It is not necessary to identify those orders in
the notice of appeal.
(5) Final Judgment. The notice of appeal encompasses the final judgment, whether or not that
judgment is set out in a separate document under Rule 7058, if the notice identifies:
(A) an order that adjudicates all remaining claims and the rights and liabilities of all
remaining parties; or
[Release Point 118-106]
(B) an order described in Rule 8002(b)(1).
(6) Limited Appeal. An appellant may identify only part of a judgment or appealable order or
decree by expressly stating that the notice of appeal is so limited. Without such an express
statement, specific identifications do not limit the scope of the notice of appeal.
(7) Impermissible Ground for Dismissal. An appeal must not be dismissed for failure to
properly identify the judgment or appealable order or decree if the notice of appeal was filed after
entry of the judgment or appealable order or decree and identifies an order that merged into that
judgment or appealable order or decree.
(8) Additional Copies. If requested to do so, the appellant must furnish the bankruptcy clerk
with enough copies of the notice to enable the clerk to comply with subdivision (c).
(b) JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED APPEALS.
(1) Joint Notice of Appeal. When two or more parties are entitled to appeal from a judgment,
order, or decree of a bankruptcy court and their interests make joinder practicable, they may file a
joint notice of appeal. They may then proceed on appeal as a single appellant.
(2) Consolidating Appeals. When parties have separately filed timely notices of appeal, the
district court or BAP may join or consolidate the appeals.
(c) SERVING THE NOTICE OF APPEAL.
(1) Serving Parties and Transmitting to the United States Trustee. The bankruptcy clerk must
serve the notice of appeal on counsel of record for each party to the appeal, excluding the
appellant, and transmit it to the United States trustee. If a party is proceeding pro se, the clerk must
send the notice of appeal to the party's last known address. The clerk must note, on each copy, the
date when the notice of appeal was filed.
(2) Effect of Failing to Serve or Transmit Notice. The bankruptcy clerk's failure to serve notice
on a party or transmit notice to the United States trustee does not affect the validity of the appeal.
(3) Noting Service on the Docket. The clerk must note on the docket the names of the parties
served and the date and method of the service.
(d) TRANSMITTING THE NOTICE OF APPEAL TO THE DISTRICT COURT OR BAP;
DOCKETING THE APPEAL.
(1) Transmitting the Notice. The bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice of appeal
to the BAP clerk if a BAP has been established for appeals from that district and the appellant has
not elected to have the district court hear the appeal. Otherwise, the bankruptcy clerk must
promptly transmit the notice to the district clerk.
(2) Docketing in the District Court or BAP. Upon receiving the notice of appeal, the district or
BAP clerk must docket the appeal under the title of the bankruptcy case and the title of any
adversary proceeding, and must identify the appellant, adding the appellant's name if necessary.

PRIOR RULE
A prior Rule 8003, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 23,
2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009, related to leave to appeal, prior to revision of Part

COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from several former Bankruptcy Rule and Appellate Rule provisions. It addresses
appeals as of right, joint and consolidated appeals, service of the notice of appeal, and the timing of the
docketing of an appeal in the district court or BAP.
Subdivision (a) incorporates, with stylistic changes, much of the content of former Rule 8001(a) regarding
the taking of an appeal as of right under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(1) or (2). The rule now requires that the judgment,
order, or decree being appealed be attached to the notice of appeal.
Subdivision (b), which is an adaptation of F.R.App.P. 3(b), permits the filing of a joint notice of appeal by
multiple appellants that have sufficiently similar interests that their joinder is practicable. It also allows the
[Release Point 118-106]
district court or BAP to consolidate appeals taken separately by two or more parties.
Subdivision (c) is derived from former Rule 8004 and F.R.App.P. 3(d). Under Rule 8001(c), the former
rule's requirement that service of the notice of appeal be accomplished by mailing is generally modified to
require that the bankruptcy clerk serve counsel by electronic means. Service on pro se parties must be made
by sending the notice to the address most recently provided to the court.
Subdivision (d) modifies the provision of former Rule 8007(b), which delayed the docketing of an appeal
by the district court or BAP until the record was complete and the bankruptcy clerk transmitted it. The new
provision, adapted from F.R.App.P. 3(d) and 12(a), requires the bankruptcy clerk to promptly transmit the
notice of appeal to the clerk of the district court or BAP. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the district or
BAP clerk must docket the appeal. Under this procedure, motions filed in the district court or BAP prior to
completion and transmission of the record can generally be placed on the docket of an already pending appeal.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (d)(2), the direction for docketing a
bankruptcy appeal was changed to reflect the fact that many bankruptcy appeals have dual titles—the
bankruptcy case itself and the adversary proceeding that is the subject of the appeal. Stylistic changes were
made to subdivision (c)(1). Conforming changes were made to the Committee Note.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2023 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to conform to recent amendments to Fed. R. App. P. 3(c), which clarified that
the designation of a particular interlocutory order in a notice of appeal does not prevent the appellate court
from reviewing all orders that merged into the judgment or appealable order or decree. These amendments
reflect that a notice of appeal is supposed to be a simple document that provides notice that a party is
appealing and invokes the jurisdiction of the appellate court. It therefore must state who is appealing, what is
being appealed, and to what court the appeal is being taken. It is the role of the briefs, not the notice of appeal,
to focus the issues on appeal.
Subdivision (a)(3)(B) is amended in an effort to avoid the misconception that it is necessary or appropriate
to identify each and every order of the bankruptcy court that the appellant may wish to challenge on appeal. It
requires the attachment of "the judgment—or the appealable order or decree—from which the appeal is
taken"—and the phrase "or the part of it" is deleted. In most cases, because of the merger principle, it is
appropriate to identify and attach only the judgment or the appealable order or decree from which the appeal
as of right is taken.
Subdivision (a)(4) now calls attention to the merger principle. The general merger rule can be stated simply:
an appeal from a final judgment or appealable order or decree permits review of all rulings that led up to the
judgment, order, or decree. Because this general rule is subject to some exceptions and complications, the
amendment does not attempt to codify the merger principle but instead leaves its details to case law. The
amendment does not change the principle established in Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co., 486 U.S. 196,
202–03 (1988), that "a decision on the merits is a 'final decision' . . . whether or not there remains for
adjudication a request for attorney's fees attributable to the case."
Sometimes a party who is aggrieved by a final judgment will make a motion in the bankruptcy court instead
of immediately filing a notice of appeal. Rule 8002(b)(1) permits a party who makes certain motions to await
disposition of those motions before appealing. But some courts treat a notice of appeal that identifies only the
order disposing of such a motion as limited to that order, rather than bringing the final judgment before the
appellate court for review. To reduce the unintended loss of appellate rights in this situation, subdivision (a)(5)
is added. This amendment does not alter the requirement of Rule 8002(b)(3) (requiring a notice of appeal or
an amended notice of appeal if a party intends to challenge an order disposing of certain motions).
Subdivision (a)(6) is added to enable deliberate limitations of the notice of appeal. It allows an appellant to
identify only part of a judgment or appealable order or decree by expressly stating that the notice of appeal is
so limited. Without such an express statement, however, specific identifications do not limit the scope of the
notice of appeal.
On occasion, a party may file a notice of appeal after a judgment or appealable order or decree but identify
only a previously nonappealable order that merged into that judgment or appealable order or decree. To deal
with this situation, subdivision (a)(7) is added to provide that an appeal must not be dismissed for failure to
properly identify the judgment or appealable order or decree if the notice of appeal was filed after entry of the
judgment or appealable order or decree and identifies an order that merged into the judgment, order, or decree
from which the appeal is taken. In this situation, a court should act as if the notice had properly identified the
judgment or appealable order or decree. In determining whether a notice of appeal was filed after the entry of
judgment, Rules 8002(a)(2) and (b)(2) apply.
[Release Point 118-106]
Rule 8004. Appeal by Leave—How Taken; Docketing the Appeal
(a) NOTICE OF APPEAL AND MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL. To appeal from an
interlocutory order or decree of a bankruptcy court under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3), a party must file
with the bankruptcy clerk a notice of appeal as prescribed by Rule 8003(a). The notice must:
(1) be filed within the time allowed by Rule 8002;
(2) be accompanied by a motion for leave to appeal prepared in accordance with subdivision
(b); and
(3) unless served electronically using the court's transmission equipment, include proof of
service in accordance with Rule 8011(d).
(b) CONTENTS OF THE MOTION; RESPONSE.
(1) Contents. A motion for leave to appeal under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3) must include the
following:
(A) the facts necessary to understand the question presented;
(B) the question itself;
(C) the relief sought;
(D) the reasons why leave to appeal should be granted; and
(E) a copy of the interlocutory order or decree and any related opinion or memorandum.
(2) Response. A party may file with the district or BAP clerk a response in opposition or a
cross-motion within 14 days after the motion is served.
(c) TRANSMITTING THE NOTICE OF APPEAL AND THE MOTION; DOCKETING THE
APPEAL; DETERMINING THE MOTION.
(1) Transmitting to the District Court or BAP. The bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the
notice of appeal and the motion for leave to the BAP clerk if a BAP has been established for
appeals from that district and the appellant has not elected to have the district court hear the
appeal. Otherwise, the bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice and motion to the
district clerk.
(2) Docketing in the District Court or BAP. Upon receiving the notice and motion, the district
or BAP clerk must docket the appeal under the title of the bankruptcy case and the title of any
adversary proceeding, and must identify the appellant, adding the appellant's name if necessary.
(3) Oral Argument Not Required. The motion and any response or cross-motion are submitted
without oral argument unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise.
(d) FAILURE TO FILE A MOTION WITH A NOTICE OF APPEAL. If an appellant timely files
a notice of appeal under this rule but does not include a motion for leave, the district court or BAP
may order the appellant to file a motion for leave, or treat the notice of appeal as a motion for leave
and either grant or deny it. If the court orders that a motion for leave be filed, the appellant must do
so within 14 days after the order is entered, unless the order provides otherwise.
(e) DIRECT APPEAL TO A COURT OF APPEALS. If leave to appeal an interlocutory order or
decree is required under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3), an authorization of a direct appeal by the court of
appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2) satisfies the requirement.

PRIOR RULE
A prior Rule 8004, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30,
1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991, related to service of the notice of appeal, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014,
eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rules 8001(b) and 8003 and F.R.App.P. 5. It retains the practice for
interlocutory bankruptcy appeals of requiring a notice of appeal to be filed along with a motion for leave to
appeal. Like current Rule 8003, it alters the timing of the docketing of the appeal in the district court or BAP.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subdivision (a) requires a party seeking leave to appeal under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3) to file with the
bankruptcy clerk both a notice of appeal and a motion for leave to appeal.
Subdivision (b) prescribes the contents of the motion, retaining the requirements of former Rule 8003(a). It
also continues to allow another party to file a cross-motion or response to the appellant's motion. Because of
the prompt docketing of the appeal under the current rule, the cross-motion or response must be filed in the
district court or BAP, rather than in the bankruptcy court as the former rule required.
Subdivision (c) requires the bankruptcy clerk to transmit promptly to the district court or BAP the notice of
appeal and the motion for leave to appeal. Upon receipt of the notice and the motion, the district or BAP clerk
must docket the appeal. Unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise, no oral argument will be held on
the motion.
Subdivision (d) retains the provisions of former Rule 8003(c). It provides that if the appellant timely files a
notice of appeal, but fails to file a motion for leave to appeal, the court can either direct that a motion be filed
or treat the notice of appeal as the motion and either grant or deny leave.
Subdivision (e), like former Rule 8003(d), treats the authorization of a direct appeal by the court of appeals
as a grant of leave to appeal under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3) if the district court or BAP has not already granted
leave. Thus, a separate order granting leave to appeal is not required. If the court of appeals grants permission
to appeal, the record must be assembled and transmitted in accordance with Rules 8009 and 8010.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (c)(2), the direction for docketing a
bankruptcy appeal was changed to reflect the fact that many bankruptcy appeals have dual titles—the
bankruptcy case itself and the adversary proceeding that is the subject of the appeal. As published, subdivision
(c)(3) stated that the court must dismiss the appeal if the motion for leave to appeal is denied. That sentence
was deleted.
Rule 8005. Election to Have an Appeal Heard by the District Court Instead of the
BAP
(a) FILING OF A STATEMENT OF ELECTION. To elect to have an appeal heard by the district
court, a party must:
(1) file a statement of election that conforms substantially to the appropriate Official Form; and
(2) do so within the time prescribed by 28 U.S.C. §158(c)(1).
(b) TRANSMITTING THE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE APPEAL. Upon receiving an
appellant's timely statement of election, the bankruptcy clerk must transmit to the district clerk all
documents related to the appeal. Upon receiving a timely statement of election by a party other than
the appellant, the BAP clerk must transmit to the district clerk all documents related to the appeal
and notify the bankruptcy clerk of the transmission.
(c) DETERMINING THE VALIDITY OF AN ELECTION. A party seeking a determination of
the validity of an election must file a motion in the court where the appeal is then pending. The
motion must be filed within 14 days after the statement of election is filed.
(d) MOTION FOR LEAVE WITHOUT A NOTICE OF APPEAL—EFFECT ON THE TIMING
OF AN ELECTION. If an appellant moves for leave to appeal under Rule 8004 but fails to file a
separate notice of appeal with the motion, the motion must be treated as a notice of appeal for
purposes of determining the timeliness of a statement of election.

PRIOR RULE
A prior Rule 8005, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987, related
to stay pending appeal, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule, which implements 28 U.S.C. §158(c)(1), is derived from former Rule 8001(e). It applies only in
districts in which an appeal to a BAP is authorized.
As the former rule required, subdivision (a) provides that an appellant that elects to have a district court,
rather than a BAP, hear its appeal must file with the bankruptcy clerk a statement of election when it files its
notice of appeal. The statement must conform substantially to the appropriate Official Form. For appellants,
[Release Point 118-106]
that statement is included in the Notice of Appeal Official Form. If a BAP has been established for appeals
from the bankruptcy court and the appellant does not file a timely statement of election, any other party that
elects to have the district court hear the appeal must file a statement of election with the BAP clerk no later
than 30 days after service of the notice of appeal.
Subdivision (b) requires the bankruptcy clerk to transmit all appeal documents to the district clerk if the
appellant files a timely statement of election. If the appellant does not make that election, the bankruptcy clerk
must transmit those documents to the BAP clerk. Upon a timely election by any other party, the BAP clerk
must promptly transmit the appeal documents to the district clerk and notify the bankruptcy clerk that the
appeal has been transferred.
Subdivision (c) provides a new procedure for the resolution of disputes regarding the validity of an election.
A motion seeking the determination of the validity of an election must be filed no later than 14 days after the
statement of election is filed. Nothing in this rule prevents a court from determining the validity of an election
on its own motion.
Subdivision (d) provides that, in the case of an appeal by leave, if the appellant files a motion for leave to
appeal but fails to file a notice of appeal, the filing and service of the motion will be treated for timing
purposes under this rule as the filing and service of the notice of appeal.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (b), a requirement was added that the BAP
clerk notify the bankruptcy clerk if an appeal is transferred from the BAP to the district court upon the
election of an appellee. Conforming and clarifying changes were made to the Committee Note.
Rule 8006. Certifying a Direct Appeal to the Court of Appeals
(a) EFFECTIVE DATE OF A CERTIFICATION. A certification of a judgment, order, or decree
of a bankruptcy court for direct review in a court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2) is effective
when:
(1) the certification has been filed;
(2) a timely appeal has been taken under Rule 8003 or 8004; and
(3) the notice of appeal has become effective under Rule 8002.
(b) FILING THE CERTIFICATION. The certification must be filed with the clerk of the court
where the matter is pending. For purposes of this rule, a matter remains pending in the bankruptcy
court for 30 days after the effective date under Rule 8002 of the first notice of appeal from the
judgment, order, or decree for which direct review is sought. A matter is pending in the district court
or BAP thereafter.
(c) JOINT CERTIFICATION BY ALL APPELLANTS AND APPELLEES.
(1) How Accomplished. A joint certification by all the appellants and appellees under 28 U.S.C.
§158(d)(2)(A) must be made by using the appropriate Official Form. The parties may supplement
the certification with a short statement of the basis for the certification, which may include the
information listed in subdivision (f)(2).
(2) Supplemental Statement by the Court. Within 14 days after the parties' certification, the
bankruptcy court or the court in which the matter is then pending may file a short supplemental
statement about the merits of the certification.
(d) THE COURT THAT MAY MAKE THE CERTIFICATION. Only the court where the matter
is pending, as provided in subdivision (b), may certify a direct review on request of parties or on its
own motion.
(e) CERTIFICATION ON THE COURT'S OWN MOTION.
(1) How Accomplished. A certification on the court's own motion must be set forth in a separate
document. The clerk of the certifying court must serve it on the parties to the appeal in the manner
required for service of a notice of appeal under Rule 8003(c)(1). The certification must be
accompanied by an opinion or memorandum that contains the information required by subdivision
(f)(2)(A)–(D).
(2) Supplemental Statement by a Party. Within 14 days after the court's certification, a party
may file with the clerk of the certifying court a short supplemental statement regarding the merits
[Release Point 118-106]
of certification.
(f) CERTIFICATION BY THE COURT ON REQUEST.
(1) How Requested. A request by a party for certification that a circumstance specified in 28
U.S.C. §158(d)(2)(A)(i)–(iii) applies—or a request by a majority of the appellants and a majority
of the appellees—must be filed with the clerk of the court where the matter is pending within 60
days after the entry of the judgment, order, or decree.
(2) Service and Contents. The request must be served on all parties to the appeal in the manner
required for service of a notice of appeal under Rule 8003(c)(1), and it must include the following:
(A) the facts necessary to understand the question presented;
(B) the question itself;
(C) the relief sought;
(D) the reasons why the direct appeal should be allowed, including which circumstance
specified in 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2)(A)(i)–(iii) applies; and
(E) a copy of the judgment, order, or decree and any related opinion or memorandum.
(3) Time to File a Response or a Cross-Request. A party may file a response to the request
within 14 days after the request is served, or such other time as the court where the matter is
pending allows. A party may file a cross-request for certification within 14 days after the request
is served, or within 60 days after the entry of the judgment, order, or decree, whichever occurs
first.
(4) Oral Argument Not Required. The request, cross-request, and any response are submitted
without oral argument unless the court where the matter is pending orders otherwise.
(5) Form and Service of the Certification. If the court certifies a direct appeal in response to the
request, it must do so in a separate document. The certification must be served on the parties to the
appeal in the manner required for service of a notice of appeal under Rule 8003(c)(1).
(g) PROCEEDING IN THE COURT OF APPEALS FOLLOWING A CERTIFICATION. Within
30 days after the date the certification becomes effective under subdivision (a), a request for
permission to take a direct appeal to the court of appeals must be filed with the circuit clerk in
accordance with F.R.App.P. 6(c).

and issues on appeal, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8001(f), and it provides the procedures for the certification of a direct
appeal of a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to the court of appeals under 28 U.S.C.
§158(d)(2). Once a case has been certified in the bankruptcy court, the district court, or the BAP for direct
appeal and a request for permission to appeal has been timely filed with the circuit clerk, the Federal Rules of
Appellate Procedure govern further proceedings in the court of appeals.
Subdivision (a), like the former rule, requires that an appeal be properly taken—now under Rule 8003 or
8004—before a certification for direct review in the court of appeals takes effect. This rule requires the timely
filing of a notice of appeal under Rule 8002 and accounts for the delayed effectiveness of a notice of appeal
under the circumstances specified in that rule. Ordinarily, a notice of appeal is effective when it is filed in the
bankruptcy court. Rule 8002, however, delays the effectiveness of a notice of appeal when (1) it is filed after
the announcement of a decision or order but prior to the entry of the judgment, order, or decree; or (2) it is
filed after the announcement or entry of a judgment, order, or decree but before the bankruptcy court disposes
of certain postjudgment motions.
When the bankruptcy court enters an interlocutory order or decree that is appealable under 28 U.S.C.
§158(a)(3), certification for direct review in the court of appeals may take effect before the district court or
BAP grants leave to appeal. The certification is effective when the actions specified in subdivision (a) have
[Release Point 118-106]
occurred. Rule 8004(e) provides that if the court of appeals grants permission to take a direct appeal before
leave to appeal an interlocutory ruling has been granted, the authorization by the court of appeals is treated as
the granting of leave to appeal.
Subdivision (b) provides that a certification must be filed in the court where the matter is pending, as
determined by this subdivision. This provision modifies the former rule. Because of the prompt docketing of
appeals in the district court or BAP under Rules 8003 and 8004, a matter is deemed—for purposes of this rule
only—to remain pending in the bankruptcy court for 30 days after the effective date of the notice of appeal.
This provision will in appropriate cases give the bankruptcy judge, who will be familiar with the matter being
appealed, an opportunity to decide whether certification for direct review is appropriate. Similarly, subdivision
(d) provides that only the court where the matter is then pending according to subdivision (b) may make a
certification on its own motion or on the request of one or more parties.
Section 158(d)(2) provides three different ways in which an appeal may be certified for direct review.
Implementing these options, the rule provides in subdivision (c) for the joint certification by all appellants and
appellees; in subdivision (e) for the bankruptcy court's, district court's, or BAP's certification on its own
motion; and in subdivision (f) for the bankruptcy court's, district court's, or BAP's certification on request of a
party or a majority of appellants and a majority of appellees.
Subdivision (g) requires that, once a certification for direct review is made, a request to the court of appeals
for permission to take a direct appeal to that court must be filed with the clerk of the court of appeals no later
than 30 days after the effective date of the certification. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 6(c), which
incorporates all of F.R.App.P. 5 except subdivision (a)(3), prescribes the procedure for requesting the
permission of the court of appeals and governs proceedings that take place thereafter in that court.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivisions (b) and (g), cross-references were added. In
subdivision (f)(4), the statement regarding the inapplicability of Rule 9014 was deleted as unnecessary. A
clarifying change was made to the first paragraph of the Committee Note.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c) is amended to provide authority for the court to file a statement on the merits of a
certification for direct review by the court of appeals when the certification is made jointly by all of the parties
to the appeal. It is a counterpart to subdivision (e)(2), which allows a party to file a similar statement when the
court certifies direct review on the court's own motion.
The bankruptcy court may file a supplemental statement within 14 days after the certification, even if the
appeal is no longer pending before it according to subdivision (b). If the appeal is pending in the district court
or BAP during that 14-day period, the appellate court is authorized to file a statement. In all cases, the filing of
a statement by the court is discretionary.
REFERENCES IN TEXT
The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, referred to in subd. (g), are set out in the Appendix to Title 28,
Judiciary and Judicial Procedure.
Rule 8007. Stay Pending Appeal; Bonds; Suspension of Proceedings
(a) INITIAL MOTION IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT.
(1) In General. Ordinarily, a party must move first in the bankruptcy court for the following
relief:
(A) a stay of a judgment, order, or decree of the bankruptcy court pending appeal;
(B) the approval of a bond or other security provided to obtain a stay of judgment;
(C) an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction while an appeal is
pending; or
(D) the suspension or continuation of proceedings in a case or other relief permitted by
subdivision (e).
(2) Time to File. The motion may be made either before or after the notice of appeal is filed.
(b) MOTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT, THE BAP, OR THE COURT OF APPEALS ON
DIRECT APPEAL.
(1) Request for Relief. A motion for the relief specified in subdivision (a)(1)—or to vacate or
[Release Point 118-106]
modify a bankruptcy court's order granting such relief—may be made in the court where the
appeal is pending.
(2) Showing or Statement Required. The motion must:
(A) show that moving first in the bankruptcy court would be impracticable; or
(B) if a motion was made in the bankruptcy court, either state that the court has not yet ruled
on the motion, or state that the court has ruled and set out any reasons given for the ruling.
(3) Additional Content. The motion must also include:
(A) the reasons for granting the relief requested and the facts relied upon;
(B) affidavits or other sworn statements supporting facts subject to dispute; and
(C) relevant parts of the record.
(4) Serving Notice. The movant must give reasonable notice of the motion to all parties.
(c) FILING A BOND OR OTHER SECURITY. The district court, BAP, or court of appeals may
condition relief on filing a bond or other security with the bankruptcy court.
(d) BOND OR OTHER SECURITY FOR A TRUSTEE OR THE UNITED STATES. The court
may require a trustee to file a bond or other security when the trustee appeals. A bond or other
security is not required when an appeal is taken by the United States, its officer, or its agency or by
direction of any department of the federal government.
(e) CONTINUATION OF PROCEEDINGS IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. Despite Rule
7062 and subject to the authority of the district court, BAP, or court of appeals, the bankruptcy court
may:
(1) suspend or order the continuation of other proceedings in the case; or
(2) issue any other appropriate orders during the pendency of an appeal to protect the rights of
all parties in interest.

COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8005 and F.R.App.P. 8. It now applies to direct appeals in courts of
appeals.
Subdivision (a), like the former rule, requires a party ordinarily to seek relief pending an appeal in the
bankruptcy court. Subdivision (a)(1) expands the list of relief enumerated in F.R.App.P. 8(a)(1) to reflect
bankruptcy practice. It includes the suspension or continuation of other proceedings in the bankruptcy case, as
authorized by subdivision (e). Subdivision (a)(2) clarifies that a motion for a stay pending appeal, approval of
a supersedeas bond, or any other relief specified in paragraph (1) may be made in the bankruptcy court before
or after the filing of a notice of appeal.
Subdivision (b) authorizes a party to seek the relief specified in (a)(1), or the vacation or modification of the
granting of such relief, by means of a motion filed in the court where the appeal is pending—district court,
BAP, or the court of appeals on direct appeal. Accordingly, a notice of appeal need not be filed with respect to
a bankruptcy court's order granting or denying such a motion. The motion for relief in the district court, BAP,
or court of appeals must state why it was impracticable to seek relief initially in the bankruptcy court, if a
motion was not filed there, or why the bankruptcy court denied the relief sought.
Subdivisions (c) and (d) retain the provisions of the former rule that permit the district court or BAP—and
now the court of appeals—to condition the granting of relief on the posting of a bond by the appellant, except
when that party is a federal government entity. Rule 9025 governs proceedings against sureties.
Subdivision (e) retains the provision of the former rule that authorizes the bankruptcy court to decide
whether to suspend or allow the continuation of other proceedings in the bankruptcy case while the matter for
which a stay has been sought is pending on appeal.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The clause "or where it will be taken" was deleted in
subdivision (b)(1). Stylistic changes were made to the titles of subdivisions (b) and (e) and in subdivision
[Release Point 118-106]
(e)(1). A discussion of subdivision (e) was added to the Committee Note.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
The amendments to subdivisions (a)(1)(B), (c), and (d) conform this rule with the amendment of Rule 62
F.R.Civ.P., which is made applicable to adversary proceedings by Rule 7062. Rule 62 formerly required a
party to provide a "supersedeas bond" to obtain a stay of the judgment and proceedings to enforce the
judgment. As amended, Rule 62(b) allows a party to obtain a stay by providing a "bond or other security."
Rule 8008. Indicative Rulings
(a) RELIEF PENDING APPEAL. If a party files a timely motion in the bankruptcy court for relief
that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, the
bankruptcy court may:
(1) defer considering the motion;
(2) deny the motion; or
(3) state that the court would grant the motion if the court where the appeal is pending remands
for that purpose, or state that the motion raises a substantial issue.
(b) NOTICE TO THE COURT WHERE THE APPEAL IS PENDING. The movant must
promptly notify the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending if the bankruptcy court states that
it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue.
(c) REMAND AFTER AN INDICATIVE RULING. If the bankruptcy court states that it would
grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue, the district court or BAP may remand
for further proceedings, but it retains jurisdiction unless it expressly dismisses the appeal. If the
district court or BAP remands but retains jurisdiction, the parties must promptly notify the clerk of
that court when the bankruptcy court has decided the motion on remand.

A prior Rule 8008, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 23,

COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is an adaptation of F.R.Civ.P. 62.1 and F.R.App.P. 12.1. It provides a procedure for the issuance
of an indicative ruling when a bankruptcy court determines that, because of a pending appeal, the court lacks
jurisdiction to grant a request for relief that the court concludes is meritorious or raises a substantial issue. The
rule does not attempt to define the circumstances in which an appeal limits or defeats the bankruptcy court's
authority to act in the face of a pending appeal. In contrast, Rule 8002(b) identifies motions that, if filed within
the relevant time limit, suspend the effect of a notice of appeal filed before the last such motion is resolved. In
those circumstances, the bankruptcy court has authority to resolve the motion without resorting to the
indicative ruling procedure.
Subdivision (b) requires the movant to notify the court where an appeal is pending if the bankruptcy court
states that it would grant the motion or that it raises a substantial issue. This provision applies to appeals
pending in the district court, the BAP, or the court of appeals.
Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 6 and 12.1 govern the procedure in the court of appeals following
notification of the bankruptcy court's indicative ruling.
Subdivision (c) of this rule governs the procedure in the district court or BAP upon notification that the
bankruptcy court has issued an indicative ruling. The district court or BAP may remand to the bankruptcy
court for a ruling on the motion for relief. The district court or BAP may also remand all proceedings, thereby
terminating the initial appeal, if it expressly states that it is dismissing the appeal. It should do so, however,
only when the appellant has stated clearly its intention to abandon the appeal. Otherwise, the district court or
BAP may remand for the purpose of ruling on the motion, while retaining jurisdiction to proceed with the
appeal after the bankruptcy court rules, provided that the appeal is not then moot and a party wishes to
proceed.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.

(A) The appellant must file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve on the appellee a designation
of the items to be included in the record on appeal and a statement of the issues to be presented.
(B) The appellant must file and serve the designation and statement within 14 days after:
(i) the appellant's notice of appeal as of right becomes effective under Rule 8002; or
(ii) an order granting leave to appeal is entered.
A designation and statement served prematurely must be treated as served on the first day on
which filing is timely.
(2) Appellee and Cross-Appellant. Within 14 days after being served, the appellee may file with
the bankruptcy clerk and serve on the appellant a designation of additional items to be included in
the record. An appellee who files a cross-appeal must file and serve a designation of additional
items to be included in the record and a statement of the issues to be presented on the cross-appeal.
(3) Cross-Appellee. Within 14 days after service of the cross-appellant's designation and
statement, a cross-appellee may file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve on the cross-appellant a
designation of additional items to be included in the record.
(4) Record on Appeal. The record on appeal must include the following:
• docket entries kept by the bankruptcy clerk;
• items designated by the parties;
• the notice of appeal;
• the judgment, order, or decree being appealed;
• any order granting leave to appeal;
• any certification required for a direct appeal to the court of appeals;
• any opinion, findings of fact, and conclusions of law relating to the issues on appeal,
including transcripts of all oral rulings;
• any transcript ordered under subdivision (b);
• any statement required by subdivision (c); and
• any additional items from the record that the court where the appeal is pending orders.
(5) Copies for the Bankruptcy Clerk. If paper copies are needed, a party filing a designation of
items must provide a copy of any of those items that the bankruptcy clerk requests. If the party
fails to do so, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare the copy at the party's expense.
(b) TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS.
(1) Appellant's Duty to Order. Within the time period prescribed by subdivision (a)(1), the
appellant must:
(A) order in writing from the reporter, as defined in Rule 8010(a)(1), a transcript of such
parts of the proceedings not already on file as the appellant considers necessary for the appeal,
and file a copy of the order with the bankruptcy clerk; or
(B) file with the bankruptcy clerk a certificate stating that the appellant is not ordering a
transcript.
(2) Cross-Appellant's Duty to Order. Within 14 days after the appellant files a copy of the
transcript order or a certificate of not ordering a transcript, the appellee as cross-appellant must:
(A) order in writing from the reporter, as defined in Rule 8010(a)(1), a transcript of such
additional parts of the proceedings as the cross-appellant considers necessary for the appeal, and
file a copy of the order with the bankruptcy clerk; or
(B) file with the bankruptcy clerk a certificate stating that the cross-appellant is not ordering a
[Release Point 118-106]
transcript.
(3) Appellee's or Cross-Appellee's Right to Order. Within 14 days after the appellant or
cross-appellant files a copy of a transcript order or certificate of not ordering a transcript, the
appellee or cross-appellee may order in writing from the reporter a transcript of such additional
parts of the proceedings as the appellee or cross-appellee considers necessary for the appeal. A
copy of the order must be filed with the bankruptcy clerk.
(4) Payment. At the time of ordering, a party must make satisfactory arrangements with the
reporter for paying the cost of the transcript.
(5) Unsupported Finding or Conclusion. If the appellant intends to argue on appeal that a
finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant
must include in the record a transcript of all relevant testimony and copies of all relevant exhibits.
(c) STATEMENT OF THE EVIDENCE WHEN A TRANSCRIPT IS UNAVAILABLE. If a
transcript of a hearing or trial is unavailable, the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence
or proceedings from the best available means, including the appellant's recollection. The statement
must be filed within the time prescribed by subdivision (a)(1) and served on the appellee, who may
serve objections or proposed amendments within 14 days after being served. The statement and any
objections or proposed amendments must then be submitted to the bankruptcy court for settlement
and approval. As settled and approved, the statement must be included by the bankruptcy clerk in the
record on appeal.
(d) AGREED STATEMENT AS THE RECORD ON APPEAL. Instead of the record on appeal as
defined in subdivision (a), the parties may prepare, sign, and submit to the bankruptcy court a
statement of the case showing how the issues presented by the appeal arose and were decided in the
bankruptcy court. The statement must set forth only those facts alleged and proved or sought to be
proved that are essential to the court's resolution of the issues. If the statement is accurate,
it—together with any additions that the bankruptcy court may consider necessary to a full
presentation of the issues on appeal—must be approved by the bankruptcy court and must then be
certified to the court where the appeal is pending as the record on appeal. The bankruptcy clerk must
then transmit it to the clerk of that court within the time provided by Rule 8010. A copy of the agreed
statement may be filed in place of the appendix required by Rule 8018(b) or, in the case of a direct
appeal to the court of appeals, by F.R.App.P. 30.
(e) CORRECTING OR MODIFYING THE RECORD.
(1) Submitting to the Bankruptcy Court. If any difference arises about whether the record
accurately discloses what occurred in the bankruptcy court, the difference must be submitted to
and settled by the bankruptcy court and the record conformed accordingly. If an item has been
improperly designated as part of the record on appeal, a party may move to strike that item.
(2) Correcting in Other Ways. If anything material to either party is omitted from or misstated
in the record by error or accident, the omission or misstatement may be corrected, and a
supplemental record may be certified and transmitted:
(A) on stipulation of the parties;
(B) by the bankruptcy court before or after the record has been forwarded; or
(C) by the court where the appeal is pending.
(3) Remaining Questions. All other questions as to the form and content of the record must be
presented to the court where the appeal is pending.
(f) SEALED DOCUMENTS. A document placed under seal by the bankruptcy court may be
designated as part of the record on appeal. In doing so, a party must identify it without revealing
confidential or secret information, but the bankruptcy clerk must not transmit it to the clerk of the
court where the appeal is pending as part of the record. Instead, a party must file a motion with the
[Release Point 118-106]
court where the appeal is pending to accept the document under seal. If the motion is granted, the
movant must notify the bankruptcy court of the ruling, and the bankruptcy clerk must promptly
transmit the sealed document to the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending.
(g) OTHER NECESSARY ACTIONS. All parties to an appeal must take any other action
necessary to enable the bankruptcy clerk to assemble and transmit the record.

PRIOR RULE
A prior Rule 8009, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Mar. 26,

Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8006 and F.R.App.P. 10 and 11(a). The provisions of this rule and
Rule 8010 are applicable to appeals taken directly to a court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2), as well as
to appeals to a district court or BAP. See F.R.App.P. 6(c)(2)(A) and (B).
The rule retains the practice of former Rule 8006 of requiring the parties to designate items to be included
in the record on appeal. In this respect, the bankruptcy rule differs from the appellate rule. Among other
things, F.R.App.P. 10(a) provides that the record on appeal consists of all the documents and exhibits filed in
the case. This requirement would often be unworkable in a bankruptcy context because thousands of items
might have been filed in the overall bankruptcy case.
Subdivision (a) provides the time period for an appellant to file a designation of items to be included in the
record on appeal and a statement of the issues to be presented. It then provides for the designation of
additional items by the appellee, cross-appellant, and cross-appellee, as well as for the cross-appellant's
statement of the issues to be presented in its appeal. Subdivision (a)(4) prescribes the content of the record on
appeal. Ordinarily, the bankruptcy clerk will not need to have paper copies of the designated items because the
clerk will either transmit them to the appellate court electronically or otherwise make them available
electronically. If the bankruptcy clerk requires a paper copy of some or all of the items designated as part of
the record, the clerk may request the party that designated the item to provide the necessary copies, and the
party must comply with the request or bear the cost of the clerk's copying.
Subdivision (b) governs the process for ordering a complete or partial transcript of the bankruptcy court
proceedings. In situations in which a transcript is unavailable, subdivision (c) allows for the parties'
preparation of a statement of the evidence or proceedings, which must be approved by the bankruptcy court.
Subdivision (d) adopts the practice of F.R.App.P. 10(d) of permitting the parties to agree on a statement of
the case in place of the record on appeal. The statement must show how the issues on appeal arose and were
decided in the bankruptcy court. It must be approved by the bankruptcy court in order to be certified as the
record on appeal.
Subdivision (e), modeled on F.R.App.P. 10(e), provides a procedure for correcting the record on appeal if
an item is improperly designated, omitted, or misstated.
Subdivision (f) is a new provision that governs the handling of any document that remains sealed by the
bankruptcy court and that a party wants to include in the record on appeal. The party must request the court
where the appeal is pending to accept the document under seal, and that motion must be granted before the
bankruptcy clerk may transmit the sealed document to the district, BAP, or circuit clerk.
Subdivision (g) requires the parties' cooperation with the bankruptcy clerk in assembling and transmitting
the record. It retains the requirement of former Rule 8006, which was adapted from F.R.App.P. 11(a).
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (a)(2) and (3), the place of filing was
clarified. "Docket entries kept by the bankruptcy clerk" was added to the list in subdivision (a)(4).
REFERENCES IN TEXT
The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, referred to in subd. (d), are set out in the Appendix to Title 28,
Judiciary and Judicial Procedure.
Rule 8010. Completing and Transmitting the Record
(a) REPORTER'S DUTIES.
(1) Proceedings Recorded Without a Reporter Present. If proceedings were recorded without a
reporter being present, the person or service selected under bankruptcy court procedures to
[Release Point 118-106]
transcribe the recording is the reporter for purposes of this rule.
(2) Preparing and Filing the Transcript. The reporter must prepare and file a transcript as
follows:
(A) Upon receiving an order for a transcript in accordance with Rule 8009(b), the reporter
must file in the bankruptcy court an acknowledgment of the request that shows when it was
received, and when the reporter expects to have the transcript completed.
(B) After completing the transcript, the reporter must file it with the bankruptcy clerk, who
will notify the district, BAP, or circuit clerk of its filing.
(C) If the transcript cannot be completed within 30 days after receiving the order, the reporter
must request an extension of time from the bankruptcy clerk. The clerk must enter on the docket
and notify the parties whether the extension is granted.
(D) If the reporter does not file the transcript on time, the bankruptcy clerk must notify the
bankruptcy judge.
(b) CLERK'S DUTIES.
(1) Transmitting the Record—In General. Subject to Rule 8009(f) and subdivision (b)(5) of this
rule, when the record is complete, the bankruptcy clerk must transmit to the clerk of the court
where the appeal is pending either the record or a notice that the record is available electronically.
(2) Multiple Appeals. If there are multiple appeals from a judgment, order, or decree, the
bankruptcy clerk must transmit a single record.
(3) Receiving the Record. Upon receiving the record or notice that it is available electronically,
the district, BAP, or circuit clerk must enter that information on the docket and promptly notify all
parties to the appeal.
(4) If Paper Copies Are Ordered. If the court where the appeal is pending directs that paper
copies of the record be provided, the clerk of that court must so notify the appellant. If the
appellant fails to provide them, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare them at the appellant's expense.
(5) When Leave to Appeal is Requested. Subject to subdivision (c), if a motion for leave to
appeal has been filed under Rule 8004, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare and transmit the record
only after the district court, BAP, or court of appeals grants leave.
(c) RECORD FOR A PRELIMINARY MOTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT, BAP, OR
COURT OF APPEALS. This subdivision (c) applies if, before the record is transmitted, a party
moves in the district court, BAP, or court of appeals for any of the following relief:
• leave to appeal;
• dismissal;
• a stay pending appeal;
• approval of a bond or other security provided to obtain a stay of judgment; or
• any other intermediate order.
The bankruptcy clerk must then transmit to the clerk of the court where the relief is sought any
parts of the record designated by a party to the appeal or a notice that those parts are available
electronically.

Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8007 and F.R.App.P. 11. It applies to an appeal taken directly to a
court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2), as well as to an appeal to a district court or BAP.
Subdivision (a) generally retains the procedure of former Rule 8007(a) regarding the reporter's duty to
prepare and file a transcript if a party requests one. It clarifies that the person or service that transcribes the
recording of a proceeding is considered the reporter under this rule if the proceeding is recorded without a
[Release Point 118-106]
reporter being present in the courtroom. It also makes clear that the reporter must file with the bankruptcy
court the acknowledgment of the request for a transcript and statement of the expected completion date, the
completed transcript, and any request for an extension of time beyond 30 days for completion of the transcript.
Subdivision (b) requires the bankruptcy clerk to transmit the record to the district, BAP or circuit clerk
when the record is complete and, in the case of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3), leave to appeal has been
granted. This transmission will be made electronically, either by sending the record itself or sending notice
that the record can be accessed electronically. The court where the appeal is pending may, however, require
that a paper copy of some or all of the record be furnished, in which case the clerk of that court will direct the
appellant to provide the copies. If the appellant does not do so, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare the copies at
the appellant's expense.
In a change from former Rule 8007(b), subdivision (b) of this rule no longer directs the clerk of the
appellate court to docket the appeal upon receipt of the record from the bankruptcy clerk. Instead, under Rules
8003(d) and 8004(c) and F.R.App.P. 12(a), the district, BAP, or circuit clerk dockets the appeal upon receipt
of the notice of appeal or, in the case of appeals under 28 U.S.C. §158(a)(3), the notice of appeal and the
motion for leave to appeal. Accordingly, by the time the district, BAP, or circuit clerk receives the record, the
appeal will already be docketed in that court. The clerk of the appellate court must indicate on the docket and
give notice to the parties to the appeal when the transmission of the record is received. Under Rule 8018(a)
and F.R.App.P. 31, the briefing schedule is generally based on that date.
Subdivision (c) is derived from former Rule 8007(c) and F.R.App.P. 11(g). It provides for the transmission
of parts of the record that the parties designate for consideration by the district court, BAP, or court of appeals
in ruling on specified preliminary motions filed prior to the preparation and transmission of the record on
appeal.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Subdivision (a)(1) was revised to more accurately reflect
the way in which transcription services are selected. A cross-reference to Rule 8009(b) was added to
subdivision (a)(2)(A).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
The amendment of subdivision (c) conforms this rule with the amendment of Rule 62 F.R.Civ.P., which is
made applicable in adversary proceedings by Rule 7062. Rule 62 formerly required a party to provide a
"supersedeas bond" to obtain a stay of the judgment and proceedings to enforce the judgment. As amended,
Rule 62(b) allows a party to obtain a stay by providing a "bond or other security."
Rule 8011. Filing and Service; Signature
(a) FILING.
(1) With the Clerk. A document required or permitted to be filed in a district court or BAP must
be filed with the clerk of that court.
(2) Method and Timeliness.
(A) Nonelectronic Filing.
(i) In General. For a document not filed electronically, filing may be accomplished by mail
addressed to the clerk of the district court or BAP. Except as provided in subdivision
(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii), filing is timely only if the clerk receives the document within the time
fixed for filing.
(ii) Brief or Appendix. A brief or appendix not filed electronically is also timely filed if, on
or before the last day for filing, it is:
• mailed to the clerk by first-class mail—or other class of mail that is at least as
expeditious—postage prepaid; or
• dispatched to a third-party commercial carrier for delivery within 3 days to the clerk.
(iii) Inmate Filing. If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, an inmate
confined there must use that system to receive the benefit of this Rule 8011(a)(2)(A)(iii). A
document not filed electronically by an inmate confined in an institution is timely if it is
deposited in the institution's internal mailing system on or before the last day for filing and:
• it is accompanied by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. §1746—or a notarized
statement—setting out the date of deposit and stating that first-class postage is being
prepaid; or evidence (such as a postmark or date stamp) showing that the notice was so
[Release Point 118-106]
deposited and that postage was prepaid; or
• the appellate court exercises its discretion to permit the later filing of a declaration or
notarized statement that satisfies this Rule 8011(a)(2)(A)(iii).
(B) Electronic Filing.
(i) By a Represented Person—Generally Required; Exceptions. An entity represented by an
attorney must file electronically, unless nonelectronic filing is allowed by the court for good
cause or is allowed or required by local rule.
(ii) By an Unrepresented Individual—When Allowed or Required. An individual not
represented by an attorney:
• may file electronically only if allowed by court order or by local rule; and
• may be required to file electronically only by court order, or by a local rule that
includes reasonable exceptions.
(iii) Same as a Written Paper. A document filed electronically is a written paper for
purposes of these rules.
(C) Copies. If a document is filed electronically, no paper copy is required. If a document is
filed by mail or delivery to the district court or BAP, no additional copies are required. But the
district court or BAP may require by local rule or by order in a particular case the filing or
furnishing of a specified number of paper copies.
(3) Clerk's Refusal of Documents. The court's clerk must not refuse to accept for filing any
document transmitted for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required
by these rules or by any local rule or practice.
(b) SERVICE OF ALL DOCUMENTS REQUIRED. Unless a rule requires service by the clerk, a
party must, at or before the time of the filing of a document, serve it on the other parties to the
appeal. Service on a party represented by counsel must be made on the party's counsel.
(c) MANNER OF SERVICE.
(1) Nonelectronic Service. Nonelectronic service may be by any of the following:
(A) personal delivery;
(B) mail; or
(C) third-party commercial carrier for delivery within 3 days.
(2) Electronic Service. Electronic service may be made by sending a document to a registered
user by filing it with the court's electronic-filing system or by using other electronic means that the
person served consented to in writing.
(3) When Service Is Complete. Service by electronic means is complete on filing or sending,
unless the person making service receives notice that the document was not received by the person
served. Service by mail or by commercial carrier is complete on mailing or delivery to the carrier.
(d) PROOF OF SERVICE.
(1) What Is Required. A document presented for filing must contain either of the following if it
was served other than through the court's electronic-filing system:
(A) an acknowledgment of service by the person served; or
(B) proof of service consisting of a statement by the person who made service certifying:
(i) the date and manner of service;
(ii) the names of the persons served; and
(iii) the mail or electronic address, the fax number, or the address of the place of delivery,
as appropriate for the manner of service, for each person served.
(2) Delayed Proof. The district or BAP clerk may permit documents to be filed without
[Release Point 118-106]
acknowledgment or proof of service, but must require the acknowledgment or proof to be filed
promptly thereafter.
(3) Brief or Appendix. When a brief or appendix is filed, the proof of service must also state the
date and manner by which it was filed.
(e) SIGNATURE. Every document filed electronically must include the electronic signature of the
person filing it or, if the person is represented, the electronic signature of counsel. A filing made
through a person's electronic-filing account and authorized by that person, together with that person's
name on a signature block, constitutes the person's signature. Every document filed in paper form
must be signed by the person filing the document or, if the person is represented, by counsel.

PRIOR RULE
A prior Rule 8011, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, related to motions, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr.
25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8008 and F.R.App.P. 25. It adopts some of the additional details of
the appellate rule, and it provides greater recognition of the possibility of electronic filing and service.
Subdivision (a) governs the filing of documents in the district court or BAP. Consistent with other
provisions of these Part VIII rules, subdivision (a)(2) requires electronic filing of documents, including briefs
and appendices, unless the district court's or BAP's procedures permit or require other methods of delivery to
the court. An electronic filing is timely if it is received by the district or BAP clerk within the time fixed for
filing. No additional copies need to be submitted when documents are filed electronically, by mail, or by
delivery unless the district court or BAP requires them.
Subdivision (a)(3) provides that the district or BAP clerk may not refuse to accept a document for filing
solely because its form does not comply with these rules or any local rule or practice. The district court or
BAP may, however, direct the correction of any deficiency in any document that does not conform to the
requirements of these rules or applicable local rules, and may prescribe such other relief as the court deems
appropriate.
Subdivisions (b) and (c) address the service of documents in the district court or BAP. Except for
documents that the district or BAP clerk must serve, a party that makes a filing must serve copies of the
document on the other parties to the appeal. Service on represented parties must be made on counsel.
Subdivision (c) expresses the general requirement under these Part VIII rules that documents be sent
electronically. See Rule 8001(c). Local court rules, however, may provide for other means of service, and
subdivision (c) specifies non-electronic methods of service by or on an unrepresented party. Electronic service
is complete upon transmission, unless the party making service receives notice that the transmission did not
reach the person intended to be served in a readable form.
Subdivision (d) retains the former rule's provisions regarding proof of service of a document filed in the
district court or BAP. In addition, it provides that a certificate of service must state the mail or electronic
address or fax number to which service was made.
Subdivision (e) is a new provision that requires an electronic signature of counsel or an unrepresented filer
for documents that are filed electronically in the district court or BAP. A local rule may specify a method of
providing an electronic signature that is consistent with any standards established by the Judicial Conference
of the United States. Paper copies of documents filed in the district court or BAP must bear an actual signature
of counsel or the filer. By requiring a signature, subdivision (e) ensures that a readily identifiable attorney or
party takes responsibility for every document that is filed.

COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to conform to the amendments to F.R.App.P. 25 on inmate filing, electronic filing,
signature, service, and proof of service.
Consistent with Rule 8001(c), subdivision (a)(2) generally makes electronic filing mandatory. The rule
recognizes exceptions for persons proceeding without an attorney, exceptions for good cause, and variations
established by local rule.
Subdivision (a)(2)(A)(iii) is revised to conform to F.R.App.P. 25(a)(2)(A)(iii), which was recently amended
to streamline and clarify the operation of the inmate-filing rule. The rule requires the inmate to show timely
[Release Point 118-106]
deposit and prepayment of postage. It is amended to specify that a notice is timely if it is accompanied by a
declaration or notarized statement stating the date the notice was deposited in the institution's mail system and
attesting to the prepayment of first-class postage. The declaration must state that first-class postage "is being
prepaid," not (as directed by the former rule) that first-class postage "has been prepaid." This change reflects
the fact that inmates may need to rely upon the institution to affix postage after the inmate has deposited the
document in the institution's mail system. A new Director's Form sets out a suggested form of the declaration.
The amended rule also provides that a notice is timely without a declaration or notarized statement if other
evidence accompanying the notice shows that the notice was deposited on or before the due date and that
postage was prepaid. If the notice is not accompanied by evidence that establishes timely deposit and
prepayment of postage, then the appellate court—district court, BAP, or court of appeals in the case of a direct
appeal—has discretion to accept a declaration or notarized statement at a later date. The rule uses the phrase
"exercises its discretion to permit"—rather than simply "permits"—to help ensure that pro se inmates are
aware that a court will not necessarily forgive a failure to provide the declaration initially.
Subdivision (c) is amended to authorize electronic service by means of the court's electronic-filing system
on registered users without requiring their written consent. All other forms of electronic service require the
written consent of the person served.
Service is complete when a person files the paper with the court's electronic-filing system for transmission
to a registered user, or when one person sends it to another person by other electronic means that the other
person has consented to in writing. But service is not effective if the person who filed with the court or the
person who sent by other agreed-upon electronic means receives notice that the paper did not reach the person
to be served. The rule does not make the court responsible for notifying a person who filed the paper with the
court's electronic-filing system that an attempted transmission by the court's system failed. But a filer who
receives notice that the transmission failed is responsible for making effective service.
As amended, subdivision (d) eliminates the requirement of proof of service when service is made through
the electronic-filing system. The notice of electronic filing generated by the system serves that purpose.
Subdivision (e) requires the signature of counsel or an unrepresented party on every document that is filed.
A filing made through a person's electronic-filing account and authorized by that person, together with that
person's name on a signature block, constitutes the person's signature. A person's electronic-filing account
means an account established by the court for use of the court's electronic-filing system, which account the
person accesses with the user name and password (or other credentials) issued to that person by the court.
Rule 8012. Disclosure Statement
(a) NONGOVERNMENTAL CORPORATIONS. Any nongovernmental corporation that is a
party to a proceeding in the district court or BAP must file a statement that identifies any parent
corporation and any publicly held corporation that owns 10% or more of its stock or states that there
is no such corporation. The same requirement applies to a nongovernmental corporation that seeks to
intervene.
(b) DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE DEBTOR. The debtor, the trustee, or, if neither is a party, the
appellant must file a statement that:
(1) identifies each debtor not named in the caption; and
(2) for each debtor that is a corporation, discloses the information required by Rule 8012(a).
(c) TIME TO FILE; SUPPLEMENTAL FILING. A Rule 8012 statement must:
(1) be filed with the principal brief or upon filing a motion, response, petition, or answer in the
district court or BAP, whichever occurs first, unless a local rule requires earlier filing;
(2) be included before the table of contents in the principal brief; and
(3) be supplemented whenever the information required by Rule 8012 changes.

Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from F.R.App.P. 26.1. It requires the filing of corporate disclosure statements and
[Release Point 118-106]
supplemental statements in order to assist district court and BAP judges in determining whether they should
recuse themselves. Rule 9001 makes the definitions in §101 of the Code applicable to these rules. Under
§101(9) the word "corporation" includes a limited liability company, limited liability partnership, business
trust, and certain other entities that are not designated under applicable law as corporations.
If filed separately from a brief, motion, response, petition, or answer, the statement must be filed and served
in accordance with Rule 8011. Under Rule 8015(a)(7)(B)(iii), the corporate disclosure statement is not
included in calculating applicable word-count limitations.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. A sentence was added to the Committee Note to draw
attention to the broad definition of "corporation" under §101(9) of the Bankruptcy Code.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2020 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to conform to recent amendments to F.R.App.P. 26.1. Subdivision (a) is amended to
encompass nongovernmental corporations that seek to intervene on appeal.
New subdivision (b) requires disclosure of the name of all of the debtors in the bankruptcy case. The names
of the debtors are not always included in the caption of appeals. It also requires, for corporate debtors,
disclosure of the same information required to be disclosed under subdivision (a).
Subdivision (c), previously subdivision (b), now applies to all the disclosure requirements in Rule 8012.
Rule 8013. Motions; Intervention
(a) CONTENTS OF A MOTION; RESPONSE; REPLY.
(1) Request for Relief. A request for an order or other relief is made by filing a motion with the
district or BAP clerk.
(2) Contents of a Motion.
(A) Grounds and the Relief Sought. A motion must state with particularity the grounds for the
motion, the relief sought, and the legal argument necessary to support it.
(B) Motion to Expedite an Appeal. A motion to expedite an appeal must explain what
justifies considering the appeal ahead of other matters. If the district court or BAP grants the
motion, it may accelerate the time to transmit the record, the deadline for filing briefs and other
documents, oral argument, and the resolution of the appeal. A motion to expedite an appeal may
be filed as an emergency motion under subdivision (d).
(C) Accompanying Documents.
(i) Any affidavit or other document necessary to support a motion must be served and filed
with the motion.
(ii) An affidavit must contain only factual information, not legal argument.
(iii) A motion seeking substantive relief must include a copy of the bankruptcy court's
judgment, order, or decree, and any accompanying opinion as a separate exhibit.
(D) Documents Barred or Not Required.
(i) A separate brief supporting or responding to a motion must not be filed.
(ii) Unless the court orders otherwise, a notice of motion or a proposed order is not
required.
(3) Response and Reply; Time to File. Unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise,
(A) any party to the appeal may file a response to the motion within 7 days after service of
the motion; and
(B) the movant may file a reply to a response within 7 days after service of the response, but
may only address matters raised in the response.
(b) DISPOSITION OF A MOTION FOR A PROCEDURAL ORDER. The district court or BAP
may rule on a motion for a procedural order—including a motion under Rule 9006(b) or (c)—at any
time without awaiting a response. A party adversely affected by the ruling may move to reconsider,
vacate, or modify it within 7 days after the procedural order is served.
(c) ORAL ARGUMENT. A motion will be decided without oral argument unless the district court
[Release Point 118-106]
or BAP orders otherwise.
(d) EMERGENCY MOTION.
(1) Noting the Emergency. When a movant requests expedited action on a motion because
irreparable harm would occur during the time needed to consider a response, the movant must
insert the word "Emergency" before the title of the motion.
(2) Contents of the Motion. The emergency motion must
(A) be accompanied by an affidavit setting out the nature of the emergency;
(B) state whether all grounds for it were submitted to the bankruptcy court and, if not, why
the motion should not be remanded for the bankruptcy court to consider;
(C) include the e-mail addresses, office addresses, and telephone numbers of moving counsel
and, when known, of opposing counsel and any unrepresented parties to the appeal; and
(D) be served as prescribed by Rule 8011.
(3) Notifying Opposing Parties. Before filing an emergency motion, the movant must make
every practicable effort to notify opposing counsel and any unrepresented parties in time for them
to respond. The affidavit accompanying the emergency motion must state when and how notice
was given or state why giving it was impracticable.
(e) POWER OF A SINGLE BAP JUDGE TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION.
(1) Single Judge's Authority. A BAP judge may act alone on any motion, but may not dismiss or
otherwise determine an appeal, deny a motion for leave to appeal, or deny a motion for a stay
pending appeal if denial would make the appeal moot.
(2) Reviewing a Single Judge's Action. The BAP may review a single judge's action, either on
its own motion or on a party's motion.
(f) FORM OF DOCUMENTS; LENGTH LIMITS; NUMBER OF COPIES.
(1) Format of a Paper Document. Rule 27(d)(1) F.R.App.P. applies in the district court or BAP
to a paper version of a motion, response, or reply.
(2) Format of an Electronically Filed Document. A motion, response, or reply filed
electronically must comply with the requirements for a paper version regarding covers, line
spacing, margins, typeface, and type style. It must also comply with the length limits under
paragraph (3).
(3) Length Limits. Except by the district court's or BAP's permission, and excluding the
accompanying documents authorized by subdivision (a)(2)(C):
(A) a motion or a response to a motion produced using a computer must include a certificate
under Rule 8015(h) and not exceed 5,200 words;
(B) a handwritten or typewritten motion or a response to a motion must not exceed 20 pages;
(C) a reply produced using a computer must include a certificate under Rule 8015(h) and not
exceed 2,600 words; and
(D) a handwritten or typewritten reply must not exceed 10 pages.
(4) Paper Copies. Paper copies must be provided only if required by local rule or by an order in
a particular case.
(g) INTERVENING IN AN APPEAL. Unless a statute provides otherwise, an entity that seeks to
intervene in an appeal pending in the district court or BAP must move for leave to intervene and
serve a copy of the motion on the parties to the appeal. The motion or other notice of intervention
authorized by statute must be filed within 30 days after the appeal is docketed. It must concisely state
the movant's interest, the grounds for intervention, whether intervention was sought in the
bankruptcy court, why intervention is being sought at this stage of the proceeding, and why
participating as an amicus curiae would not be adequate.

A prior Rule 8013, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987, related
to disposition of appeal and weight accorded bankruptcy judge's findings of fact, prior to revision of Part VIII,
Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8011 and F.R.App.P. 15(d) and 27. It adopts many of the provisions
of the appellate rules that specify the form and page limits of motions and accompanying documents, while
also adjusting those requirements for electronic filing. In addition, it prescribes the procedure for seeking to
intervene in the district court or BAP.
Subdivision (a) retains much of the content of former Rule 8011(a) regarding the contents of a motion,
response, and reply. It also specifies the documents that may accompany a motion. Unlike the former rule,
which allowed the filing of separate briefs supporting a motion, subdivision (a) now adopts the practice of
F.R.App.P. 27(a) of prohibiting the filing of briefs supporting or responding to a motion. The motion or
response itself must include the party's legal arguments.
Subdivision (a)(2)(B) clarifies the procedure for seeking to expedite an appeal. A motion under this
provision seeks to expedite the time for the disposition of the appeal as a whole, whereas an emergency
motion—which is addressed by subdivision (d)—typically involves an urgent request for relief short of
disposing of the entire appeal (for example, an emergency request for a stay pending appeal to prevent
imminent mootness). In appropriate cases—such as when there is an urgent need to resolve the appeal quickly
to prevent harm—a party may file a motion to expedite the appeal as an emergency motion.
Subdivision (b) retains the substance of former Rule 8011(b). It authorizes the district court or BAP to act
on a motion for a procedural order without awaiting a response to the motion. It specifies that a party seeking
reconsideration, vacation, or modification of the order must file a motion within 7 days after service of the
order.
Subdivision (c) continues the practice of former Rule 8011(c) and F.R.App.P. 27(e) of dispensing with oral
argument of motions in the district court or BAP unless the court orders otherwise.
Subdivision (d), which carries forward the content of former Rule 8011(d), governs emergency motions that
the district court or BAP may rule on without awaiting a response when necessary to prevent irreparable harm.
A party seeking expedited action on a motion in the district court or BAP must explain the nature of the
emergency, whether all grounds in support of the motion were first presented to the bankruptcy court, and, if
not, why the district court or BAP should not remand for reconsideration. The moving party must also explain
the steps taken to notify opposing counsel and any unrepresented parties in advance of filing the emergency
motion and, if they were not notified, why it was impracticable to do so.
Subdivision (e), like former Rule 8011(e) and similar to F.R.App.P. 27(c), authorizes a single BAP judge to
rule on certain motions. This authority, however, does not extend to issuing rulings that would dispose of the
appeal. For that reason, the rule now prohibits a single BAP judge from denying a motion for a stay pending
appeal when the effect of that ruling would be to require dismissal of the appeal as moot. A ruling by a single
judge is subject to review by the BAP.
Subdivision (f) incorporates by reference the formatting and appearance requirements of F.R.App.P.
27(d)(1). When paper versions of the listed documents are filed, they must comply with the requirements of
the specified rules regarding reproduction, covers, binding, appearance, and format. When these documents
are filed electronically, they must comply with the relevant requirements of the specified rules regarding
covers and format. Subdivision (f) also specifies page limits for motions, responses, and replies, which is a
matter that former Rule 8011 did not address.
Subdivision (g) clarifies the procedure for seeking to intervene in a proceeding that has been appealed. It is
based on F.R.App.P. 15(d), but it also requires the moving party to explain why intervention is being sought at
the appellate stage. The former Part VIII rules did not address intervention.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Subdivision (a)(2)(D) was changed to allow the court to
require a notice of motion or proposed order. A stylistic change was made to subdivision (d)(2)(B).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (f)(3) is amended to conform to F.R.App.P. 27(d)(2), which was recently amended to replace
page limits with word limits for motions and responses produced using a computer. The word limits were
derived from the current page limits, using the assumption that one page is equivalent to 260 words.
Documents produced using a computer must include the certificate of compliance required by Rule 8015(h);
Official Form 417C suffices to meet that requirement. Page limits are retained for papers prepared without the
aid of a computer (i.e., handwritten or typewritten papers). For both the word limit and the page limit, the
[Release Point 118-106]
calculation excludes the accompanying documents required by Rule 8013(a)(2)(C) and any items listed in
Rule 8015(h).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2020 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a)(1) is amended to delete the reference to proof of service. This change reflects the recent
amendment to Rule 8011(d) that eliminated the requirement of proof of service when filing and service are
completed using a court's electronic-filing system.
REFERENCES IN TEXT
The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, referred to in subd. (f)(1), are set out in the Appendix to Title
28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure.
Rule 8014. Briefs
(a) APPELLANT'S BRIEF. The appellant's brief must contain the following under appropriate
headings and in the order indicated:
(1) a corporate disclosure statement, if required by Rule 8012;

references to the pages of the brief where they are cited;
(4) a jurisdictional statement, including:
(A) the basis for the bankruptcy court's subject-matter jurisdiction, with citations to
applicable statutory provisions and stating relevant facts establishing jurisdiction;

(6) a concise statement of the case setting out the facts relevant to the issues submitted for
review, describing the relevant procedural history, and identifying the rulings presented for
review, with appropriate references to the record;
(7) a summary of the argument, which must contain a succinct, clear, and accurate statement of
the arguments made in the body of the brief, and which must not merely repeat the argument
headings;
(8) the argument, which must contain the appellant's contentions and the reasons for them, with
citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies;
(9) a short conclusion stating the precise relief sought; and
(10) the certificate of compliance, if required by Rule 8015(a)(7) or (b).
(b) APPELLEE'S BRIEF. The appellee's brief must conform to the requirements of subdivision
(a)(1)–(8) and (10), except that none of the following need appear unless the appellee is dissatisfied
with the appellant's statement:
(1) the jurisdictional statement;
(2) the statement of the issues and the applicable standard of appellate review; and
(3) the statement of the case.
(c) REPLY BRIEF. The appellant may file a brief in reply to the appellee's brief. A reply brief
must comply with the requirements of subdivision (a)(2)–(3).
(d) STATUTES, RULES, REGULATIONS, OR SIMILAR AUTHORITY. If the court's
determination of the issues presented requires the study of the Code or other statutes, rules,
regulations, or similar authority, the relevant parts must be set out in the brief or in an addendum.
[Release Point 118-106]
(e) BRIEFS IN A CASE INVOLVING MULTIPLE APPELLANTS OR APPELLEES. In a case
involving more than one appellant or appellee, including consolidated cases, any number of
appellants or appellees may join in a brief, and any party may adopt by reference a part of another's
brief. Parties may also join in reply briefs.
(f) CITATION OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITIES. If pertinent and significant authorities
come to a party's attention after the party's brief has been filed—or after oral argument but before a
decision—a party may promptly advise the district or BAP clerk by a signed submission setting forth
the citations. The submission, which must be served on the other parties to the appeal, must state the
reasons for the supplemental citations, referring either to the pertinent page of a brief or to a point
argued orally. The body of the submission must not exceed 350 words. Any response must be made
within 7 days after the party is served, unless the court orders otherwise, and must be similarly
limited.

PRIOR RULE
A prior Rule 8014, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987, related
to costs, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8010(a) and (b) and F.R.App.P. 28. Adopting much of the content of
Rule 28, it provides greater detail than former Rule 8010 contained regarding appellate briefs.
Subdivision (a) prescribes the content and structure of the appellant's brief. It largely follows former Rule
8010(a)(1), but, to ensure national uniformity, it eliminates the provision authorizing a district court or BAP to
alter these requirements. Subdivision (a)(1) provides that when Rule 8012 requires an appellant to file a
corporate disclosure statement, it must be placed at the beginning of the appellant's brief. Subdivision (a)(10)
is new. It implements the requirement under Rule 8015(a)(7)(C) and (b) for the filing of a certificate of
compliance with the limit on the number of words or lines allowed to be in a brief.
Subdivision (b) carries forward the provisions of former Rule 8010(a)(2).
Subdivision (c) is derived from F.R.App.P. 28(c). It authorizes an appellant to file a reply brief, which will
generally complete the briefing process.
Subdivision (d) is similar to former Rule 8010(b), but it is reworded to reflect the likelihood that briefs will
generally be filed electronically rather than in paper form.
Subdivision (e) mirrors F.R.App.P. 28(i). It authorizes multiple appellants or appellees to join in a single
brief. It also allows a party to incorporate by reference portions of another party's brief.
Subdivision (f) adopts the procedures of F.R.App.P. 28(j) with respect to the filing of supplemental
authorities with the district court or BAP after a brief has been filed or after oral argument. Unlike the
appellate rule, it specifies a period of 7 days for filing a response to a submission of supplemental authorities.
The supplemental submission and response must comply with the signature requirements of Rule 8011(e).
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
Rule 8015. Form and Length of Briefs; Form of Appendices and Other Papers
(a) PAPER COPIES OF A BRIEF. If a paper copy of a brief may or must be filed, the following

(F) the name, office address, telephone number, and e-mail address of counsel representing
the party for whom the brief is filed.
(3) Binding. The brief must be bound in any manner that is secure, does not obscure the text,
and permits the brief to lie reasonably flat when open.
(4) Paper Size, Line Spacing, and Margins. The brief must be on 8½-by-11 inch paper. The text
must be double-spaced, but quotations more than two lines long may be indented and
single-spaced. Headings and footnotes may be single-spaced. Margins must be at least one inch on
all four sides. Page numbers may be placed in the margins, but no text may appear there.
(5) Typeface. Either a proportionally spaced or monospaced face may be used.
(A) A proportionally spaced face must include serifs, but sans-serif type may be used in
headings and captions. A proportionally spaced face must be 14-point or larger.
(B) A monospaced face may not contain more than 10½ characters per inch.
(6) Type Styles. A brief must be set in plain, roman style, although italics or boldface may be

with subdivision (a)(2) and (4), except for the paper requirement of (a)(4).
(e) OTHER DOCUMENTS.
(1) Motion. Rule 8013(f) governs the form of a motion, response, or reply.
(2) Paper Copies of Other Documents. A paper copy of any other document, other than a
submission under Rule 8014(f), must comply with subdivision (a), with the following exceptions:
(A) A cover is not necessary if the caption and signature page together contain the
information required by subdivision (a)(2).
(B) Subdivision (a)(7) does not apply.
(3) Other Documents Filed Electronically. Any other document filed electronically, other than a
submission under Rule 8014(f), must comply with the appearance requirements of paragraph (2).
(f) LOCAL VARIATION. A district court or BAP must accept documents that comply with the

form requirements of this rule and the length limits set by Part VIII of these rules. By local rule or
order in a particular case, a district court or BAP may accept documents that do not meet all the form
requirements of this rule or the length limits set by Part VIII of these rules.
(g) ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM LENGTH. In computing any length limit, headings, footnotes,
and quotations count toward the limit, but the following items do not:
• cover page;
• disclosure statement under Rule 8012;
• table of contents;
• table of citations;
• statement regarding oral argument;
• addendum containing statutes, rules, or regulations;
• certificates of counsel;
• signature block;
• proof of service; and
• any item specifically excluded by these rules or by local rule.
(h) CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.
(1) Briefs and Documents That Require a Certificate. A brief submitted under Rule
8015(a)(7)(B), 8016(d)(2), or 8017(b)(4)—and a document submitted under Rule 8013(f)(3)(A),
8013(f)(3)(C), or 8022(b)(1)—must include a certificate by the attorney, or an unrepresented
party, that the document complies with the type-volume limitation. The individual preparing the
certificate may rely on the word or line count of the word-processing system used to prepare the
document. The certificate must state the number of words—or the number of lines of monospaced
type—in the document.
(2) Acceptable Form. The certificate requirement is satisfied by a certificate of compliance that
conforms substantially to the appropriate Official Form.

A prior Rule 8015, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Mar. 26,

COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived primarily from F.R.App.P. 32. Former Rule 8010(c) prescribed page limits for principal
briefs and reply briefs. Those limits are now addressed by subdivision (a)(7) of this rule. In addition, the rule
incorporates most of the detail of F.R.App.P. 32 regarding the appearance and format of briefs, appendices,
and other documents, along with new provisions that apply when those documents are filed electronically.
Subdivision (a) prescribes the form requirements for briefs that are filed in paper form. It incorporates
F.R.App.P. 32(a), except it does not include color requirements for brief covers, it requires the cover of a brief
to include counsel's e-mail address, and cross-references to the appropriate bankruptcy rules are substituted for
references to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
Subdivision (a)(7) decreases the length of briefs, as measured by the number of pages, that was permitted
by former Rule 8010(c). Page limits are reduced from 50 to 30 pages for a principal brief and from 25 to 15
for a reply brief in order to achieve consistency with F.R.App.P. 32(a)(7). But as permitted by the appellate
rule, subdivision (a)(7) also permits the limits on the length of a brief to be measured by a word or line count,
as an alternative to a page limit. Basing the calculation of brief length on either of the type-volume methods
specified in subdivision (a)(7)(B) will result in briefs that may exceed the designated page limits in (a)(7)(A)
and that may be approximately as long as allowed by the prior page limits.
Subdivision (b) adapts for briefs that are electronically filed subdivision (a)'s form requirements. With the
use of electronic filing, the method of reproduction, method of binding, and use of paper become irrelevant.
But information required on the cover, formatting requirements, and limits on brief length remain the same.
Subdivisions (c) and (d) prescribe the form requirements for appendices. Subdivision (c), applicable to
paper appendices, is derived from F.R.App.P. 32(b), and subdivision (d) adapts those requirements for
electronically filed appendices.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subdivision (e), which is based on F.R.App.P. 32(c), addresses the form required for documents—in paper
form or electronically filed—that these rules do not otherwise cover.
Subdivision (f), like F.R.App.P. 32(e), provides assurance to lawyers and parties that compliance with this
rule's form requirements will allow a brief or other document to be accepted by any district court or BAP. A
court may, however, by local rule or, under Rule 8028 by order in a particular case, choose to accept briefs
and documents that do not comply with all of this rule's requirements. The decision whether to accept a brief
that appears not to be in compliance with the rules must be made by the court. Under Rule 8011(a)(3), the
clerk may not refuse to accept a document for filing solely because it is not presented in proper form as
required by these rules or any local rule or practice.
Under Rule 8011(e), the party filing the document or, if represented, its counsel must sign all briefs and
other submissions. If the document is filed electronically, an electronic signature must be provided in
accordance with Rule 8011(e).
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (f), "or order in a particular case" was
deleted as unnecessary. The discussion in the Committee Note about brief lengths was revised, and the
discussion of subdivision (f) was expanded.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to conform to recent amendments to F.R.App.P. 32, which reduced the word limits
generally allowed for briefs. When Rule 32(a)(7)(B)'s type-volume limits for briefs were adopted in 1998, the
word limits were based on an estimate of 280 words per page. Amended F.R.App.P. 32 applies a conversion
ratio of 260 words per page and reduces the word limits accordingly. Rule 8015(a)(7) adopts the same reduced
word limits for briefs prepared by computer.
In a complex case, a party may need to file a brief that exceeds the type-volume limitations specified in
these rules, such as to include unusually voluminous information explaining relevant background or legal
provisions or to respond to multiple briefs by opposing parties or amici. The Committee expects that courts
will accommodate those situations by granting leave to exceed the type-volume limitations as appropriate.
Subdivision (f) is amended to make clear a court's ability (by local rule or order in a case) to increase the
length limits for briefs and other documents. Subdivision (f) already established this authority as to the length
limits in Rule 8015(a)(7); the amendment makes clear that this authority extends to all length limits in Part
VIII of the Bankruptcy Rules.
A new subdivision (g) is added to set out a global list of items excluded from length computations, and the
list of exclusions in former subdivision (a)(7)(B)(iii) is deleted. The certificate-of-compliance provision
formerly in subdivision (a)(7)(C) is relocated to a new subdivision (h) and now applies to filings under all
type-volume limits (other than Rule 8014(f)'s word limit)—including the new word limits in Rules 8013,
8016, 8017, and 8022. Conforming amendments are made to Official Form 417C.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2020 AMENDMENT
The amendment to subdivision (g) is made to reflect recent amendments to Rule 8011(d) that eliminated the
requirement of proof of service when filing and service are completed using a court's electronic-filing system.
Because each item listed in Rule 8015(g) will not always be required, the initial article is deleted. The word
"corporate" is deleted before "disclosure statement" to reflect a concurrent change in the title of Rule 8012.
Rule 8016. Cross-Appeals
(a) APPLICABILITY. This rule applies to a case in which a cross-appeal is filed. Rules
8014(a)–(c), 8015(a)(7)(A)–(B), and 8018(a)(1)–(3) do not apply to such a case, except as otherwise
provided in this rule.
(b) DESIGNATION OF APPELLANT. The party who files a notice of appeal first is the appellant
for purposes of this rule and Rule 8018(a)(4) and (b) and Rule 8019. If notices are filed on the same
day, the plaintiff, petitioner, applicant, or movant in the proceeding below is the appellant. These
designations may be modified by the parties' agreement or by court order.
(c) BRIEFS. In a case involving a cross-appeal:
(1) Appellant's Principal Brief. The appellant must file a principal brief in the appeal. That brief
must comply with Rule 8014(a).
(2) Appellee's Principal and Response Brief. The appellee must file a principal brief in the
cross-appeal and must, in the same brief, respond to the principal brief in the appeal. That brief
must comply with Rule 8014(a), except that the brief need not include a statement of the case
[Release Point 118-106]
unless the appellee is dissatisfied with the appellant's statement.
(3) Appellant's Response and Reply Brief. The appellant must file a brief that responds to the
principal brief in the cross-appeal and may, in the same brief, reply to the response in the appeal.
That brief must comply with Rule 8014(a)(2)–(8) and (10), except that none of the following need
appear unless the appellant is dissatisfied with the appellee's statement in the cross-appeal:
(A) the jurisdictional statement;
(B) the statement of the issues and the applicable standard of appellate review; and
(C) the statement of the case.
(4) Appellee's Reply Brief. The appellee may file a brief in reply to the response in the
cross-appeal. That brief must comply with Rule 8014(a)(2)–(3) and (10) and must be limited to the
issues presented by the cross-appeal.
(d) LENGTH.
(1) Page Limitation. Unless it complies with paragraph (2), the appellant's principal brief must
not exceed 30 pages; the appellee's principal and response brief, 35 pages; the appellant's response
and reply brief, 30 pages; and the appellee's reply brief, 15 pages.
(2) Type-volume Limitation.
(A) The appellant's principal brief or the appellant's response and reply brief is acceptable if
it includes a certificate under Rule 8015(h) and:
(i) contains no more than 13,000 words; or
(ii) uses a monospaced face and contains no more than 1,300 lines of text.
(B) The appellee's principal and response brief is acceptable if it includes a certificate under
Rule 8015(h) and:
(i) contains no more than 15,300 words; or
(ii) uses a monospaced face and contains no more than 1,500 lines of text.
(C) The appellee's reply brief is acceptable if it includes a certificate under Rule 8015(h) and
contains no more than half of the type volume specified in subparagraph (A).
(e) TIME TO SERVE AND FILE A BRIEF. Briefs must be served and filed as follows, unless the
district court or BAP by order in a particular case excuses the filing of briefs or specifies different
time limits:
(1) the appellant's principal brief, within 30 days after the docketing of notice that the record has
been transmitted or is available electronically;
(2) the appellee's principal and response brief, within 30 days after the appellant's principal brief
is served;
(3) the appellant's response and reply brief, within 30 days after the appellee's principal and
response brief is served; and
(4) the appellee's reply brief, within 14 days after the appellant's response and reply brief is
served, but at least 7 days before scheduled argument unless the district court or BAP, for good
cause, allows a later filing.

PRIOR RULE
A prior Rule 8016, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30,
1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991, related to duties of clerk of district court and bankruptcy appellate panel, prior to
revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from F.R.App.P. 28.1. It governs the timing, content, length, filing, and service of briefs
in bankruptcy appeals in which there is a cross-appeal. The former Part VIII rules did not separately address
the topic of cross-appeals.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subdivision (b) prescribes which party is designated the appellant when there is a cross-appeal. Generally,
the first to file a notice of appeal will be the appellant.
Subdivision (c) specifies the briefs that the appellant and the appellee may file. Because of the dual role of
the parties to the appeal and cross-appeal, each party is permitted to file a principal brief and a response to the
opposing party's brief, as well as a reply brief. For the appellee, the principal brief in the cross-appeal and the
response in the appeal are combined into a single brief. The appellant, on the other hand, initially files a
principal brief in the appeal and later files a response to the appellee's principal brief in the cross-appeal, along
with a reply brief in the appeal. The final brief that may be filed is the appellee's reply brief in the
cross-appeal.
Subdivision (d), which prescribes page limits for briefs, is adopted from F.R.App.P. 28.1(e). It applies to
briefs that are filed electronically, as well as to those filed in paper form. Like Rule 8015(a)(7), it imposes
limits measured by either the number of pages or the number of words or lines of text.
Subdivision (e) governs the time for filing briefs in cases in which there is a cross-appeal. It adapts the
provisions of F.R.App.P. 28.1(f).
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Subdivision (d)(2)(D) was added, and subdivision (f) was
deleted. In subdivision (a), the statement that Rule 8018(a) does not apply was changed to refer to Rule
8018(a)(1)–(3). In subdivision (b), Rule 8018(a)(4) was added to the list of rules. Conforming changes were
made to the Committee Note.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to conform to recent amendments to F.R.App.P. 28.1, which reduced the word limits
generally allowed for briefs in cross-appeals. When Rule 28.1 was adopted in 2005, it modeled its
type-volume limits on those set forth in F.R.App.P. 32(a)(7) for briefs in cases that did not involve a
cross-appeal. At that time, Rule 32(a)(7)(B) set word limits based on an estimate of 280 words per page.
Amended F.R.App.P. 32 and 28.1 apply a conversion ratio of 260 words per page and reduce the word limits
accordingly. Rule 8016(d)(2) adopts the same reduced word limits.
In a complex case, a party may need to file a brief that exceeds the type-volume limitations specified in
these rules, such as to include unusually voluminous information explaining relevant background or legal
provisions or to respond to multiple briefs by opposing parties or amici. The Committee expects that courts
will accommodate those situations by granting leave to exceed the type-volume limitations as appropriate.
Subdivision (d) is amended to refer to new Rule 8015(h) (which now contains the certificate-of-compliance
provision formerly in Rule 8015(a)(7)(C)).
Rule 8017. Brief of an Amicus Curiae
(a) DURING INITIAL CONSIDERATION OF A CASE ON THE MERITS.
(1) Applicability. This Rule 8017(a) governs amicus filings during a court's initial consideration
of a case on the merits.
(2) When Permitted. The United States or its officer or agency or a state may file an amicus
brief without the consent of the parties or leave of court. Any other amicus curiae may file a brief
only by leave of court or if the brief states that all parties have consented to its filing, but a district
court or BAP may prohibit the filing of or may strike an amicus brief that would result in a judge's
disqualification. On its own motion, and with notice to all parties to an appeal, the district court or
BAP may request a brief by an amicus curiae.
(3) Motion for Leave to File. The motion must be accompanied by the proposed brief and state:
(A) the movant's interest; and
(B) the reason why an amicus brief is desirable and why the matters asserted are relevant to
the disposition of the appeal.
(4) Contents and Form. An amicus brief must comply with Rule 8015. In addition to the
requirements of Rule 8015, the cover must identify the party or parties supported and indicate
whether the brief supports affirmance or reversal. If an amicus curiae is a corporation, the brief
must include a disclosure statement like that required of parties by Rule 8012. An amicus brief
need not comply with Rule 8014, but must include the following:
(A) a table of contents, with page references;
(B) a table of authorities—cases (alphabetically arranged), statutes, and other
[Release Point 118-106]
authorities—with references to the pages of the brief where they are cited;
(C) a concise statement of the identity of the amicus curiae, its interest in the case, and the
source of its authority to file;
(D) unless the amicus curiae is one listed in the first sentence of subdivision (a)(2), a
statement that indicates whether:
(i) a party's counsel authored the brief in whole or in part;
(ii) a party or a party's counsel contributed money that was intended to fund preparing or
submitting the brief; and
(iii) a person—other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel— contributed
money that was intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief and, if so, identifies each
such person;
(E) an argument, which may be preceded by a summary and need not include a statement of
the applicable standard of review; and
(F) a certificate of compliance, if required by Rule 8015(h).
(5) Length. Except by the district court's or BAP's permission, an amicus brief must be no more
than one-half the maximum length authorized by these rules for a party's principal brief. If the
court grants a party permission to file a longer brief, that extension does not affect the length of an
amicus brief.
(6) Time for Filing. An amicus curiae must file its brief, accompanied by a motion for filing
when necessary, no later than 7 days after the principal brief of the party being supported is filed.
An amicus curiae that does not support either party must file its brief no later than 7 days after the
appellant's principal brief is filed. The district court or BAP may grant leave for later filing,
specifying the time within which an opposing party may answer.
(7) Reply Brief. Except by the district court's or BAP's permission, an amicus curiae may not
file a reply brief.
(8) Oral Argument. An amicus curiae may participate in oral argument only with the district
court's or BAP's permission.
(b) DURING CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER TO GRANT REHEARING.
(1) Applicability. This Rule 8017(b) governs amicus filings during a district court's or BAP's
consideration of whether to grant rehearing, unless a local rule or order in a case provides
otherwise.
(2) When Permitted. The United States or its officer or agency or a state may file an amicus
brief without the consent of the parties or leave of court. Any other amicus curiae may file a brief
only by leave of court.
(3) Motion for Leave to File. Rule 8017(a)(3) applies to a motion for leave.
(4) Contents, Form, and Length. Rule 8017(a)(4) applies to the amicus brief. The brief must
include a certificate under Rule 8015(h) and not exceed 2,600 words.
(5)Time for Filing. An amicus curiae supporting the motion for rehearing or supporting neither
party must file its brief, accompanied by a motion for filing when necessary, no later than 7 days
after the motion is filed. An amicus curiae opposing the motion for rehearing must file its brief,
accompanied by a motion for filing when necessary, no later than the date set by the court for the
response.

COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from F.R.App.P. 29. The former Part VIII rules did not address the participation by an
[Release Point 118-106]
amicus curiae in a bankruptcy appeal.
Subdivision (a) adopts the provisions of F.R.App.P. 29(a). In addition, it authorizes the district court or
BAP on its own motion—with notice to the parties—to request the filing of a brief by an amicus curiae.
Subdivisions (b)–(g) adopt F.R.App.P. 29(b)–(g).
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
Rule 8017 is amended to conform to the recent amendment to F.R.App.P. 29, which now addresses amicus
filings in connection with petitions for rehearing. Former Rule 8017 is renumbered Rule 8017(a), and
language is added to that subdivision (a) to state that its provisions apply to amicus filings during the district
court's or BAP's initial consideration of a case on the merits. New subdivision (b) is added to address amicus
filings in connection with a motion for rehearing. Subdivision (b) sets default rules that apply when a district
court or BAP does not provide otherwise by local rule or by order in a case. A court remains free to adopt
different rules governing whether amicus filings are permitted in connection with motions for rehearing and
the procedures when such filings are permitted.
The amendment to subdivision (a)(2) authorizes orders or local rules that prohibit the filing of or permit the
striking of an amicus brief by party consent if the brief would result in a judge's disqualification. The
amendment does not alter or address the standards for when an amicus brief requires a judge's disqualification.
It is modeled on an amendment to F.R.App.P. 29(a). A comparable amendment to subdivision (b) is not
necessary. Subdivision (b)(1) authorizes local rules and orders governing filings during a court's consideration
of whether to grant rehearing. These local rules or orders may prohibit the filing of or permit the striking of an
amicus brief that would result in a judge's disqualification. In addition, under subdivision (b)(2), a court may
deny leave to file an amicus brief that would result in a judge's disqualification.
Rule 8018. Serving and Filing Briefs; Appendices
(a) TIME TO SERVE AND FILE A BRIEF. The following rules apply unless the district court or
BAP by order in a particular case excuses the filing of briefs or specifies different time limits:
(1) The appellant must serve and file a brief within 30 days after the docketing of notice that the
record has been transmitted or is available electronically.
(2) The appellee must serve and file a brief within 30 days after service of the appellant's brief.
(3) The appellant may serve and file a reply brief within 14 days after service of the appellee's
brief, but a reply brief must be filed at least 7 days before scheduled argument unless the district
court or BAP, for good cause, allows a later filing.
(4) If an appellant fails to file a brief on time or within an extended time authorized by the
district court or BAP, an appellee may move to dismiss the appeal—or the district court or BAP,
after notice, may dismiss the appeal on its own motion. An appellee who fails to file a brief will
not be heard at oral argument unless the district court or BAP grants permission.
(b) DUTY TO SERVE AND FILE AN APPENDIX TO THE BRIEF.
(1) Appellant. Subject to subdivision (e) and Rule 8009(d), the appellant must serve and file
with its principal brief excerpts of the record as an appendix. It must contain the following:
(A) the relevant entries in the bankruptcy docket;
(B) the complaint and answer, or other equivalent filings;
(C) the judgment, order, or decree from which the appeal is taken;
(D) any other orders, pleadings, jury instructions, findings, conclusions, or opinions relevant
to the appeal;
(E) the notice of appeal; and
(F) any relevant transcript or portion of it.
(2) Appellee. The appellee may also serve and file with its brief an appendix that contains
material required to be included by the appellant or relevant to the appeal or cross-appeal, but
omitted by the appellant.
(3) Cross-Appellee. The appellant as cross-appellee may also serve and file with its response an
appendix that contains material relevant to matters raised initially by the principal brief in the
[Release Point 118-106]
cross-appeal, but omitted by the cross-appellant.
(c) FORMAT OF THE APPENDIX. The appendix must begin with a table of contents identifying
the page at which each part begins. The relevant docket entries must follow the table of contents.
Other parts of the record must follow chronologically. When pages from the transcript of
proceedings are placed in the appendix, the transcript page numbers must be shown in brackets
immediately before the included pages. Omissions in the text of documents or of the transcript must
be indicated by asterisks. Immaterial formal matters (captions, subscriptions, acknowledgments, and
the like) should be omitted.
(d) EXHIBITS. Exhibits designated for inclusion in the appendix may be reproduced in a separate
volume or volumes, suitably indexed.
(e) APPEAL ON THE ORIGINAL RECORD WITHOUT AN APPENDIX. The district court or
BAP may, either by rule for all cases or classes of cases or by order in a particular case, dispense
with the appendix and permit an appeal to proceed on the original record, with the submission of any
relevant parts of the record that the district court or BAP orders the parties to file.

PRIOR RULE
A prior Rule 8018, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 27,
1995, eff. Dec. 1, 1995, related to rules by circuit councils and district courts and procedure when there is no
controlling law, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8009 and F.R.App.P. 30 and 31. Like former Rule 8009, it addresses
the timing of serving and filing briefs and appendices, as well as the content and format of appendices. Rule
8011 governs the methods of filing and serving briefs and appendices.
The rule retains the bankruptcy practice of permitting the appellee to file its own appendix, rather than
requiring the appellant to include in its appendix matters designated by the appellee. Rule 8016 governs the
timing of serving and filing briefs when a cross-appeal is taken. This rule's provisions about appendices apply
to all appeals, including cross-appeals.
Subdivision (a) retains former Rule 8009's provision that allows the district court or BAP to dispense with
briefing or to provide different time periods than this rule specifies. It increases some of the time periods for
filing briefs from the periods prescribed by the former rule, while still retaining shorter time periods than some
provided by F.R.App.P. 31(a). The time for filing the appellant's brief is increased from 14 to 30 days after the
docketing of the notice of the transmission of the record or notice of the availability of the record. That
triggering event is equivalent to docketing the appeal under former Rule 8007. Appellate Rule 31(a)(1), by
contrast, provides the appellant 40 days after the record is filed to file its brief. The shorter time period for
bankruptcy appeals reflects the frequent need for greater expedition in the resolution of bankruptcy appeals,
while still providing the appellant more time to prepare its brief than the former rule provided.
Subdivision (a)(2) similarly expands the time period for filing the appellee's brief from 14 to 30 days after
the service of the appellant's brief. This period is the same as F.R.App.P. 31(a)(1) provides.
Subdivision (a)(3) retains the 14-day time period for filing a reply brief that the former rule prescribed, but
it qualifies that period to ensure that the final brief is filed at least 7 days before oral argument.
If a district court or BAP has a mediation procedure for bankruptcy appeals, that procedure could affect
when briefs must be filed. See Rule 8027.
Subdivision (a)(4) is new. Based on F.R.App.P. 31(c), it provides for actions that may be taken—dismissal
of the appeal or denial of participation in oral argument—if the appellant or appellee fails to file its brief.
Subdivisions (b) and (c) govern the content and format of the appendix to a brief. Subdivision (b) is similar
to former Rule 8009(b), and subdivision (c) is derived from F.R.App.P. 30(d).

30(e).
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Subdivision (a)(4) was revised to provide more detail

Rule 8018.1. District-Court Review of a Judgment that the Bankruptcy Court
[Release Point 118-106]
Lacked the Constitutional Authority to Enter
If, on appeal, a district court determines that the bankruptcy court did not have the power under
Article III of the Constitution to enter the judgment, order, or decree appealed from, the district court
may treat it as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
(Added Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018
This rule is new. It is added to prevent a district court from having to remand an appeal whenever it
determines that the bankruptcy court lacked constitutional authority to enter the judgment, order, or decree
appealed from. Consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Executive Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison, 134
S. Ct. 2165 (2014), the district court in that situation may treat the bankruptcy court's judgment as proposed
findings of fact and conclusions of law. Upon making the determination to proceed in that manner, the district
court may choose to allow the parties to file written objections to specific proposed findings and conclusions
and to respond to another party's objections, see Rule 9033; treat the parties' briefs as objections and
responses; or prescribe other procedures for the review of the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of
law.
Rule 8019. Oral Argument
(a) PARTY'S STATEMENT. Any party may file, or a district court or BAP may require, a
statement explaining why oral argument should, or need not, be permitted.
(b) PRESUMPTION OF ORAL ARGUMENT AND EXCEPTIONS. Oral argument must be
allowed in every case unless the district judge—or all the BAP judges assigned to hear the
appeal—examine the briefs and record and determine that oral argument is unnecessary because
(1) the appeal is frivolous;
(2) the dispositive issue or issues have been authoritatively decided; or
(3) the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record, and the
decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument.
(c) NOTICE OF ARGUMENT; POSTPONEMENT. The district court or BAP must advise all
parties of the date, time, and place for oral argument, and the time allowed for each side. A motion to
postpone the argument or to allow longer argument must be filed reasonably in advance of the
hearing date.
(d) ORDER AND CONTENTS OF ARGUMENT. The appellant opens and concludes the
argument. Counsel must not read at length from briefs, the record, or authorities.
(e) CROSS-APPEALS AND SEPARATE APPEALS. If there is a cross-appeal, Rule 8016(b)
determines which party is the appellant and which is the appellee for the purposes of oral argument.
Unless the district court or BAP directs otherwise, a cross-appeal or separate appeal must be argued
when the initial appeal is argued. Separate parties should avoid duplicative argument.
(f) NONAPPEARANCE OF A PARTY. If the appellee fails to appear for argument, the district
court or BAP may hear the appellant's argument. If the appellant fails to appear for argument, the
district court or BAP may hear the appellee's argument. If neither party appears, the case will be
decided on the briefs unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise.
(g) SUBMISSION ON BRIEFS. The parties may agree to submit a case for decision on the briefs,
but the district court or BAP may direct that the case be argued.
(h) USE OF PHYSICAL EXHIBITS AT ARGUMENT; REMOVAL. Counsel intending to use
physical exhibits other than documents at the argument must arrange to place them in the courtroom
on the day of the argument before the court convenes. After the argument, counsel must remove the
exhibits from the courtroom unless the district court or BAP directs otherwise. The clerk may
destroy or dispose of the exhibits if counsel does not reclaim them within a reasonable time after the
clerk gives notice to remove them.

PRIOR RULE
A prior Rule 8019, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987, related
to suspension of rules in Part VIII, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule generally retains the provisions of former Rule 8012 and adds much of the additional detail of
F.R.App.P. 34. By incorporating the more detailed provisions of the appellate rule, Rule 8019 promotes
national uniformity regarding oral argument in bankruptcy appeals.
Subdivision (a), like F.R.App.P. 34(a)(1), now allows a party to submit a statement explaining why oral
argument is or is not needed. It also authorizes a court to require this statement. Former Rule 8012 only
authorized statements explaining why oral argument should be allowed.
Subdivision (b) retains the reasons set forth in former Rule 8012 for the district court or BAP to conclude
that oral argument is not needed.
The remainder of this rule adopts the provisions of F.R.App.P. 34(b)–(g), with one exception. Rather than
requiring the district court or BAP to hear appellant's argument if the appellee does not appear, subdivision (f)
authorizes the district court or BAP to go forward with the argument in the appellee's absence. Should the
court decide, however, to postpone the oral argument in that situation, it would be authorized to do so.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
Rule 8020. Frivolous Appeal and Other Misconduct
(a) FRIVOLOUS APPEAL—DAMAGES AND COSTS. If the district court or BAP determines
that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and
reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.
(b) OTHER MISCONDUCT. The district court or BAP may discipline or sanction an attorney or
party appearing before it for other misconduct, including failure to comply with any court order.
First, however, the court must afford the attorney or party reasonable notice, an opportunity to show
cause to the contrary, and, if requested, a hearing.

PRIOR RULE
A prior Rule 8020, Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997, related to damages and costs for frivolous appeal, prior
to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8020 and F.R.App.P. 38 and 46(c). Subdivision (a) permits an award
of damages and costs to an appellee for a frivolous appeal. Subdivision (b) permits the district court or BAP to
impose on parties as well as their counsel sanctions for misconduct other than taking a frivolous appeal.
Failure to comply with a court order, for which sanctions may be imposed, may include a failure to comply
with a local court rule.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
Rule 8021. Costs
(a) AGAINST WHOM ASSESSED. The following rules apply unless the law provides or the
district court or BAP orders otherwise:
(1) if an appeal is dismissed, costs are taxed against the appellant, unless the parties agree
otherwise;
(2) if a judgment, order, or decree is affirmed, costs are taxed against the appellant;
(3) if a judgment, order, or decree is reversed, costs are taxed against the appellee;
(4) if a judgment, order, or decree is affirmed or reversed in part, modified, or vacated, costs are
taxed only as the district court or BAP orders.
(b) COSTS FOR AND AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. Costs for or against the United States,
its agency, or its officer may be assessed under subdivision (a) only if authorized by law.
[Release Point 118-106]
(c) COSTS ON APPEAL TAXABLE IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. The following costs on
appeal are taxable in the bankruptcy court for the benefit of the party entitled to costs under this rule:
(1) the production of any required copies of a brief, appendix, exhibit, or the record;
(2) the preparation and transmission of the record;
(3) the reporter's transcript, if needed to determine the appeal;
(4) premiums paid for a bond or other security to preserve rights pending appeal; and
(5) the fee for filing the notice of appeal.
(d) BILL OF COSTS; OBJECTIONS. A party who wants costs taxed must, within 14 days after
entry of judgment on appeal, file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve an itemized and verified bill of
costs. Objections must be filed within 14 days after service of the bill of costs, unless the bankruptcy
court extends the time.
(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018; Apr. 27, 2020,
eff. Dec. 1, 2020.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8014 and F.R.App.P. 39. It retains the former rule's authorization for
taxing appellate costs against the losing party and its specification of the costs that may be taxed. The rule also
incorporates some of the additional details regarding the taxing of costs contained in F.R.App.P. 39.
Consistent with former Rule 8014, the bankruptcy clerk has the responsibility for taxing all costs. Subdivision
(b), derived from F.R.App.P. 39(b), clarifies that additional authority is required for the taxation of costs by or
against federal governmental parties.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
The amendment of subdivision (c) conforms this rule with the amendment of F.R.Civ.P. 62, which is made
applicable in adversary proceedings by Rule 7062. Rule 62 formerly required a party to provide a
"supersedeas bond" to obtain a stay of the judgment and proceedings to enforce the judgment. As amended,
Rule 62(b) allows a party to obtain a stay by providing a "bond or other security."
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2020 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (d) is amended to delete the reference to proof of service. This change reflects the recent
amendment to Rule 8011(d) that eliminated the requirement of proof of service when filing and service are
completed using a court's electronic-filing system.
Rule 8022. Motion for Rehearing
(a) TIME TO FILE; CONTENTS; RESPONSE; ACTION BY THE DISTRICT COURT OR BAP
IF GRANTED.
(1) Time. Unless the time is shortened or extended by order or local rule, any motion for
rehearing by the district court or BAP must be filed within 14 days after entry of judgment on
appeal.
(2) Contents. The motion must state with particularity each point of law or fact that the movant
believes the district court or BAP has overlooked or misapprehended and must argue in support of
the motion. Oral argument is not permitted.
(3) Response. Unless the district court or BAP requests, no response to a motion for rehearing is
permitted. But ordinarily, rehearing will not be granted in the absence of such a request.
(4) Action by the District Court or BAP. If a motion for rehearing is granted, the district court or
BAP may do any of the following:
(A) make a final disposition of the appeal without reargument;
(B) restore the case to the calendar for reargument or resubmission; or
(C) issue any other appropriate order.
(b) FORM OF THE MOTION; LENGTH. The motion must comply in form with Rule 8013(f)(1)
and (2). Copies must be served and filed as provided by Rule 8011. Except by the district court's or
[Release Point 118-106]
BAP's permission:
(1) a motion for rehearing produced using a computer must include a certificate under Rule
8015(h) and not exceed 3,900 words; and
(2) a handwritten or typewritten motion must not exceed 15 pages.
(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8015 and F.R.App.P. 40. It deletes the provision of former Rule 8015
regarding the time for appeal to the court of appeals because the matter is addressed by F.R.App.P. 6(b)(2)(A).
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (b), the reference to local rule was deleted
as unnecessary.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b) is amended to conform to the recent amendment to F.R.App.P. 40(b), which was one of
several appellate rules in which word limits were substituted for page limits for documents prepared by
computer. The word limits were derived from the previous page limits using the assumption that one page is
equivalent to 260 words. Documents produced using a computer must include the certificate of compliance
required by Rule 8015(h); completion of Official Form 417C suffices to meet that requirement.
Page limits are retained for papers prepared without the aid of a computer (i.e., handwritten or typewritten
papers). For both the word limit and the page limit, the calculation excludes any items listed in Rule 8015(g).
Rule 8023. Voluntary Dismissal
(a) STIPULATED DISMISSAL. The clerk of the district court or BAP must dismiss an appeal if
the parties file a signed dismissal agreement specifying how costs are to be paid and pay any court
fees that are due.
(b) APPELLANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS. An appeal may be dismissed on the appellant's
motion on terms agreed to by the parties or fixed by the district court or BAP.
(c) OTHER RELIEF. A court order is required for any relief under Rule 8023(a) or (b) beyond the
dismissal of an appeal—including approving a settlement, vacating an action of the bankruptcy
court, or remanding the case to it.
(d) COURT APPROVAL. This rule does not alter the legal requirements governing court approval
of a settlement, payment, or other consideration.
(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 11, 2022, eff. Dec. 1, 2022.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8001(c) and F.R.App.P. 42. The provision of the former rule
regarding dismissal of appeals in the bankruptcy court prior to docketing of the appeal has been deleted. Now
that docketing occurs promptly after a notice of appeal is filed, see Rules 8003(d) and 8004(c), an appeal
likely will not be voluntarily dismissed before docketing.
The rule retains the provision of the former rule that the district or BAP clerk must dismiss an appeal upon
the parties' agreement. District courts and BAPs continue to have discretion to dismiss an appeal on an
appellant's motion. Nothing in the rule prohibits a district court or BAP from dismissing an appeal for other
reasons authorized by law, such as the failure to prosecute an appeal.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2022 AMENDMENT
The amendment is intended to conform the rule to the revised version of Appellate Rule 42(b) on which it
was modelled. It clarifies that the fees that must be paid are court fees, not attorney's fees. The rule does not
alter the legal requirements governing court approval of a settlement, payment, or other consideration. See,
e.g., Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9019 (requiring court approval of compromise or settlement). The amendment clarifies
that any order beyond mere dismissal—including approving a settlement, vacating or remanding—requires a
court order.
[Release Point 118-106]
Rule 8024. Clerk's Duties on Disposition of the Appeal
(a) JUDGMENT ON APPEAL. The district or BAP clerk must prepare, sign, and enter the
judgment after receiving the court's opinion or, if there is no opinion, as the court instructs. Noting
the judgment on the docket constitutes entry of judgment.
(b) NOTICE OF A JUDGMENT. Immediately upon the entry of a judgment, the district or BAP
clerk must:
(1) transmit a notice of the entry to each party to the appeal, to the United States trustee, and to
the bankruptcy clerk, together with a copy of any opinion; and
(2) note the date of the transmission on the docket.
(c) RETURNING PHYSICAL ITEMS. If any physical items were transmitted as the record on
appeal, they must be returned to the bankruptcy clerk on disposition of the appeal.
(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014
This rule is derived from former Rule 8016, which was adapted from F.R.App.P. 36 and 45(c) and (d). The
rule is reworded to reflect that only items in the record that are physically, as opposed to electronically,
transmitted to the district court or BAP need to be returned to the bankruptcy clerk. Other changes to the
former rule are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Stylistic changes were made to subdivision (c) and the
Committee Note.
Rule 8025. Stay of a District Court or BAP Judgment
(a) AUTOMATIC STAY OF JUDGMENT ON APPEAL. Unless the district court or BAP orders
otherwise, its judgment is stayed for 14 days after entry.
(b) STAY PENDING APPEAL TO THE COURT OF APPEALS.
(1) In General. On a party's motion and notice to all other parties to the appeal, the district court
or BAP may stay its judgment pending an appeal to the court of appeals.
(2) Time Limit. The stay must not exceed 30 days after the judgment is entered, except for cause
shown.
(3) Stay Continued. If, before a stay expires, the party who obtained the stay appeals to the court
of appeals, the stay continues until final disposition by the court of appeals.
(4) Bond or Other Security. A bond or other security may be required as a condition for
granting or continuing a stay of the judgment. A bond or other security may be required if a trustee
obtains a stay, but not if a stay is obtained by the United States or its officer or agency or at the
direction of any department of the United States government.
(c) AUTOMATIC STAY OF AN ORDER, JUDGMENT, OR DECREE OF A BANKRUPTCY
COURT. If the district court or BAP enters a judgment affirming an order, judgment, or decree of
the bankruptcy court, a stay of the district court's or BAP's judgment automatically stays the
bankruptcy court's order, judgment, or decree for the duration of the appellate stay.
(d) POWER OF A COURT OF APPEALS NOT LIMITED. This rule does not limit the power of
a court of appeals or any of its judges to do the following:
(1) stay a judgment pending appeal;
(2) stay proceedings while an appeal is pending;
(3) suspend, modify, restore, vacate, or grant a stay or an injunction while an appeal is pending;
or
(4) issue any order appropriate to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of any judgment to
be entered.

Rule 8026. Rules by Circuit Councils and District Courts; Procedure When
There is No Controlling Law
(a) LOCAL RULES BY CIRCUIT COUNCILS AND DISTRICT COURTS.
(1) Adopting Local Rules. A circuit council that has authorized a BAP under 28 U.S.C. §158(b)
may make and amend rules governing the practice and procedure on appeal from a judgment,
order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to the BAP. A district court may make and amend rules
governing the practice and procedure on appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy
court to the district court. Local rules must be consistent with, but not duplicative of, Acts of
Congress and these Part VIII rules. Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P. governs the procedure for making and
amending rules to govern appeals.
(2) Numbering. Local rules must conform to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the
Judicial Conference of the United States.
(3) Limitation on Imposing Requirements of Form. A local rule imposing a requirement of form
must not be enforced in a way that causes a party to lose any right because of a nonwillful failure
to comply.
(b) PROCEDURE WHEN THERE IS NO CONTROLLING LAW.
(1) In General. A district court or BAP may regulate practice in any manner consistent with
federal law, applicable federal rules, the Official Forms, and local rules.
(2) Limitation on Sanctions. No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for
noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law, applicable federal rules, the Official
Forms, or local rules unless the alleged violator has been furnished in the particular case with
actual notice of the requirement.

• taking an appeal as of right;
• taking an appeal by leave;
• election to have an appeal heard by a district court instead of a BAP;

PART IX—GENERAL PROVISIONS
Rule 9001. General Definitions
The definitions of words and phrases in §§101, 902, 1101, and 1502 of the Code, and the rules of
construction in §102, govern their use in these rules. In addition, the following words and phrases
used in these rules have the meanings indicated:
(1) "Bankruptcy clerk" means a clerk appointed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §156(b).
(2) "Bankruptcy Code" or "Code" means title 11 of the United States Code.
(3) "Clerk" means bankruptcy clerk, if one has been appointed, otherwise clerk of the district
court.
(4) "Court" or "judge" means the judicial officer before whom a case or proceeding is pending.
(5) "Debtor." When any act is required by these rules to be performed by a debtor or when it is
necessary to compel attendance of a debtor for examination and the debtor is not a natural person:
(A) if the debtor is a corporation, "debtor" includes, if designated by the court, any or all of its
officers, members of its board of directors or trustees or of a similar controlling body, a
controlling stockholder or member, or any other person in control; (B) if the debtor is a
partnership, "debtor" includes any or all of its general partners or, if designated by the court, any
other person in control.
(6) "Firm" includes a partnership or professional corporation of attorneys or accountants.
(7) "Judgment" means any appealable order.
(8) "Mail" means first class, postage prepaid.
(9) "Notice provider" means any entity approved by the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts to give notice to creditors under Rule 2002(g)(4).
[Release Point 118-106]

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
The terms "bankruptcy clerk" and "clerk" have been defined to reflect that unless otherwise stated, for the
purpose of these rules, the terms are meant to identify the court officer for the bankruptcy records. If a
bankruptcy clerk is appointed, all filings are made with the bankruptcy clerk. If one has not been appointed,
all filings are with the clerk of the district court. Rule 5005.
The rule is also amended to include a definition of "court or judge". Since a case or proceeding may be
before a bankruptcy judge or a judge of the district court, "court or judge" is defined to mean the judicial
officer before whom the case or proceeding is pending.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Section 582 of title 28 provides that the Attorney General may appoint one or more assistant United States
trustees in any region when the public interest so requires. This rule is amended to clarify that an assistant
United States trustee, as well as any designee of the United States trustee, is included within the meaning of
"United States trustee" in the rules.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2005 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to add the definition of a notice provider and to renumber the final three definitions in
the rule. A notice provider is an entity approved by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to
enter into agreements with entities to give notice to those entities in the form and manner agreed to by those
parties. The new definition supports the amendment to Rule 2002(g)(4) that authorizes a notice provider to
give notices under Rule 2002.
Many entities conduct business on a national scale and receive vast numbers of notices in bankruptcy cases
throughout the country. Those entities can agree with a notice provider to receive their notices in a form and at
an address or addresses that the creditor and notice provider agree upon. There are processes currently in use
that provide substantial assurance that notices are not misdirected. Any notice provider would have to
demonstrate to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts that it could provide the service in a
manner that ensures the proper delivery of notice to creditors. Once the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts approves the notice provider to enter into agreements with creditors, the notice provider and
other entities can establish the relationship that will govern the delivery of notices in cases as provided in Rule
2002(g)(4).

Rule 9002. Meanings of Words in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure When
Applicable to Cases Under the Code
The following words and phrases used in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure made applicable to
cases under the Code by these rules have the meanings indicated unless they are inconsistent with the
context:
(1) "Action" or "civil action" means an adversary proceeding or, when appropriate, a contested
petition, or proceedings to vacate an order for relief or to determine any other contested matter.
(2) "Appeal" means an appeal as provided by 28 U.S.C. §158.
(3) "Clerk" or "clerk of the district court" means the court officer responsible for the bankruptcy
records in the district.
[Release Point 118-106]
(4) "District Court," "trial court," "court," "district judge," or "judge" means bankruptcy judge if
the case or proceeding is pending before a bankruptcy judge.
(5) "Judgment" includes any order appealable to an appellate court.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993 AMENDMENT
This rule is revised to include the words "district judge" in anticipation of amendments to the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure.

Rule 9003. Prohibition of Ex Parte Contacts
(a) GENERAL PROHIBITION. Except as otherwise permitted by applicable law, any examiner,
any party in interest, and any attorney, accountant, or employee of a party in interest shall refrain
from ex parte meetings and communications with the court concerning matters affecting a particular
case or proceeding.
(b) UNITED STATES TRUSTEE. Except as otherwise permitted by applicable law, the United
States trustee and assistants to and employees or agents of the United States trustee shall refrain from
ex parte meetings and communications with the court concerning matters affecting a particular case
or proceeding. This rule does not preclude communications with the court to discuss general
problems of administration and improvement of bankruptcy administration, including the operation
of the United States trustee system.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule regulates the actions of parties in interest and their attorneys or others employed by parties in
interest. This regulation of the conduct of parties in interest and their representative is designed to insure that
the bankruptcy system operates fairly and that no appearance of unfairness is created. See H. Rep. No.
95–595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 95 et seq. (1977).
This rule is not a substitute for or limitation of any applicable canon of professional responsibility or
judicial conduct. See, e.g., Canon 7, EC7–35, Disciplinary Rule 7–110(B) of the Code of Professional
Responsibility: "Generally, in adversary proceedings a lawyer should not communicate with a judge relative
to a matter pending before, or which is to be brought before, a tribunal over which he presides in
circumstances which might have the effect or give the appearance of granting undue advantage to one party;"
and Canon 3A(4) of the Code of Judicial Conduct: "A judge should . . . neither initiate nor consider ex parte or
other communications concerning a pending or impending proceeding."
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to apply to both the bankruptcy judges and the district judges of the district.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to extend to examiners the prohibition on ex parte meetings and
communications with the court.
Subdivision (b) is derived from Rule X–1010.
Rule 9004. General Requirements of Form
(a) LEGIBILITY; ABBREVIATIONS. All petitions, pleadings, schedules and other papers shall
be clearly legible. Abbreviations in common use in the English language may be used.
(b) CAPTION. Each paper filed shall contain a caption setting forth the name of the court, the title
of the case, the bankruptcy docket number, and a brief designation of the character of the paper.
[Release Point 118-106]
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (b). Additional requirements applicable to the caption for a petition are found in Rule 1005, to
the caption for notices to creditors in Rule 2002(m), and to the caption for a pleading or other paper filed in an
adversary proceeding in Rule 7010. Failure to comply with this or any other rule imposing a merely formal
requirement does not ordinarily result in the loss of rights. See Rule 9005.
Rule 9005. Harmless Error
Rule 61 F.R.Civ.P. applies in cases under the Code. When appropriate, the court may order the
correction of any error or defect or the cure of any omission which does not affect substantial rights.

COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2007
The rule is added to adopt the new rule added to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The new Civil Rule
replaces Rule 24(c) F. R. Civ. P., so the cross reference to Civil Rule 24 contained in Rule 7024 is no longer
sufficient to bring the provisions of new Civil Rule 5.1 into adversary proceedings. This rule also makes Civil
Rule 5.1 applicable to all contested matters and other proceedings within the bankruptcy case.

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, referred to in text, are set out in the Appendix to Title 28, Judiciary
and Judicial Procedure.
Rule 9006. Computing and Extending Time; Time for Motion Papers
(a) COMPUTING TIME. The following rules apply in computing any time period specified in
these rules, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in any local rule or court order, or in any statute
that does not specify a method of computing time.
(1) Period Stated in Days or a Longer Unit. When the period is stated in days or a longer unit of
time:
(A) exclude the day of the event that triggers the period;
(B) count every day, including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and
(C) include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday,
or legal holiday.
(2) Period Stated in Hours. When the period is stated in hours:
(A) begin counting immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the period;
(B) count every hour, including hours during intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays; and
(C) if the period would end on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then continue the period
until the same time on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
(3) Inaccessibility of Clerk's Office. Unless the court orders otherwise, if the clerk's office is
[Release Point 118-106]
inaccessible:
(A) on the last day for filing under Rule 9006(a)(1), then the time for filing is extended to the
first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; or
(B) during the last hour for filing under Rule 9006(a)(2), then the time for filing is extended
to the same time on the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
(4) "Last Day" Defined. Unless a different time is set by a statute, local rule, or order in the
case, the last day ends:
(A) for electronic filing, at midnight in the court's time zone; and
(B) for filing by other means, when the clerk's office is scheduled to close.
(5) "Next Day" Defined. The "next day" is determined by continuing to count forward when the
period is measured after an event and backward when measured before an event.
(6) "Legal Holiday" Defined. "Legal holiday" means:
(A) the day set aside by statute for observing New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s
Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth National Independence Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas
Day;
(B) any day declared a holiday by the President or Congress; and
(C) for periods that are measured after an event, any other day declared a holiday by the state
where the district court is located. (In this rule, "state" includes the District of Columbia and any
United States commonwealth or territory.)
(b) ENLARGEMENT.
(1) In General. Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, when an act is
required or allowed to be done at or within a specified period by these rules or by a notice given
thereunder or by order of court, the court for cause shown may at any time in its discretion (1)
with or without motion or notice order the period enlarged if the request therefor is made before
the expiration of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order or (2) on
motion made after the expiration of the specified period permit the act to be done where the failure
to act was the result of excusable neglect.
(2) Enlargement Not Permitted. The court may not enlarge the time for taking action under
Rules 1007(d), 2003(a) and (d), 7052, 9023, and 9024.
(3) Enlargement Governed By Other Rules. The court may enlarge the time for taking action
under Rules 1006(b)(2), 1017(e), 3002(c), 4003(b), 4004(a), 4007(c), 4008(a), 8002, and 9033,
only to the extent and under the conditions stated in those rules. In addition, the court may enlarge
the time to file the statement required under Rule 1007(b)(7), and to file schedules and statements
in a small business case under §1116(3) of the Code, only to the extent and under the conditions
stated in Rule 1007(c).
(c) REDUCTION.
(1) In General. Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, when an act is required
or allowed to be done at or within a specified time by these rules or by a notice given thereunder
or by order of court, the court for cause shown may in its discretion with or without motion or
notice order the period reduced.
(2) Reduction Not Permitted. The court may not reduce the time for taking action under Rules
2002(a)(7), 2003(a), 3002(c), 3014, 3015, 4001(b)(2), (c)(2), 4003(a), 4004(a), 4007(c), 4008(a),
8002, and 9033(b). In addition, the court may not reduce the time under Rule 1007(c) to file the
statement required by Rule 1007(b)(7).
(d) MOTION PAPERS. A written motion, other than one which may be heard ex parte, and notice
of any hearing shall be served not later than seven days before the time specified for such hearing,
unless a different period is fixed by these rules or by order of the court. Such an order may for cause
[Release Point 118-106]
shown be made on ex parte application. When a motion is supported by affidavit, the affidavit shall
be served with the motion. Except as otherwise provided in Rule 9023, any written response shall be
served not later than one day before the hearing, unless the court permits otherwise.
(e) TIME OF SERVICE. Service of process and service of any paper other than process or of
notice by mail is complete on mailing.
(f) ADDITIONAL TIME AFTER SERVICE BY MAIL OR UNDER RULE 5(b)(2)(D) OR (F)
F.R.CIV.P. When there is a right or requirement to act or undertake some proceedings within a
prescribed period after being served and that service is by mail or under Rule 5(b)(2)(D) (leaving
with the clerk) or (F) (other means consented to) F.R.Civ.P., three days are added after the prescribed
period would otherwise expire under Rule 9006(a).
(g) GRAIN STORAGE FACILITY CASES. This rule shall not limit the court's authority under
§557 of the Code to enter orders governing procedures in cases in which the debtor is an owner or
operator of a grain storage facility.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 25, 1989, eff. Aug. 1, 1989; Apr. 30, 1991, eff.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a). This rule is an adaptation of Rule 6 F.R.Civ.P. It governs the time for acts to be done and
proceedings to be had in cases under the Code and any litigation arising therein.
Subdivision (b) is patterned after Rule 6(b) F.R.Civ.P. and Rule 26(b) F.R.App.P.
Paragraph (1) of this subdivision confers on the court discretion generally to authorize extensions of time
for doing acts required or allowed by these rules or orders of court. The exceptions to this general authority to
extend the time are contained in paragraphs (2) and (3).
In the interest of prompt administration of bankruptcy cases certain time periods may not be extended.
Paragraph (2) lists the rules which establish time periods which may not be extended: Rule 1007(d), time for
filing a list of 20 largest creditors; Rule 1017(b)(3), 30 day period for sending notice of dismissal for failure to
pay the filing fee; Rule 1019(2), 20 day period for notice of conversion to a chapter 7 case; Rule 2003(a),
meeting of creditors not more than 40 days after order for relief; Rule 2003(d), 10 days for filing a motion for
resolution of an election dispute; Rule 3014, time for the §1111(b)(2) election; Rule 4001(b), expiration of
stay 30 days following the commencement of final hearing; Rule 7052(b), 10 day period to move to amend
findings of fact; Rule 9015(f), 20 day period to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; Rule 9023, 10
day period to move for a new trial; and Rule 9024, time to move for relief from judgment.
Many rules which establish a time for doing an act also contain a specific authorization and standard for
granting an extension of time and, in some cases, limit the length of an extension. In some instances it would
be inconsistent with the objective of the rule and sound administration of the case to permit extension under
Rule 9006(b)(1), but with respect to the other rules it is appropriate that the power to extend time be
supplemented by Rule 9006(b)(1). Unless a rule which contains a specific authorization to extend time is
listed in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, an extension of the time may be granted under paragraph (1) of this
subdivision. If a rule is included in paragraph (3) an extension may not be granted under paragraph (1). The
following rules are listed in paragraph (3): Rule 1006(b)(2), time for paying the filing fee in installments; Rule
3002(c), 90 day period for filing a claim in a chapter 7 or 13 case; Rule 4003(b), 30 days for filing objections
to a claim of exemptions; Rule 4004(a), 60 day period to object to a discharge; Rule 4007(b), 60 day period to
file a dischargeability complaint; and Rule 8002, 10 days for filing a notice of appeal.
Subdivision (c). Paragraph (1) of this subdivision authorizes the reduction of the time periods established by
these rules or an order of the court. Excluded from this general authority are the time periods established by
the rules referred to in paragraph (2) of the subdivision: Rule 2002 (a) and (b), 20 day and 25 day notices of
certain hearings and actions in the case; Rule 2003(a), meeting of creditors to be not less than 20 days after the
order for relief; Rule 3002(c), 90 days for filing a claim in a chapter 7 or 13 case; Rule 3014, time for
§1111(b)(2) election; Rule 3015, 10 day period after filing of petition to file a chapter 13 plan; Rule 4003(a),
15 days for a dependent to claim exemptions; Rule 4004(a), 60 day period to object to a discharge; Rule
4007(c), 60 day period to file a dischargeability complaint; and Rule 8002, 10 days for filing a notice of
appeal. Reduction of the time periods fixed in the rules referred to in this subdivision would be inconsistent
with the purposes of those rules and would cause harmful uncertainty.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subdivision (d) is derived from Rule 6(d) F.R.Civ.P. The reference is to Rule 9023 instead of to Rule 59(c)
F.R.Civ.P. because Rule 9023 incorporates Rule 59 F.R.Civ.P. but excepts therefrom motions to reconsider
orders allowing and disallowing claims.
Subdivision (f) is new and is the same as Rule 6(e) F.R.Civ.P.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to conform to the 1984 amendments to Rule 6 F.R.Civ.P.
Subdivision (b). The reference to Rule 4001(b) in paragraph (3) is deleted because of the amendments made
to Rule 4001. Rule 9033, which is new, contains specific provisions governing the extension of time to file
objections to proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Rule 9033 is added to the rules referred to in
paragraph (3).
Subdivision (c). Rule 4001(b)(2) and (c)(2) provide that a final hearing on a motion to use cash collateral or
a motion for authority to obtain credit may be held no earlier than 15 days after the filing of the motion. These
two rules are added to paragraph (2) to make it clear that the 15 day period may not be reduced. Rule 9033 is
also added to paragraph (2).
Subdivision (g) is new. Under §557 of the Code, as enacted by the 1984 amendments, the court is directed
to expedite grain storage facility cases. This subdivision makes it clear this rule does not limit the court's
authority under §557.
The original Advisory Committee Note to this rule included the 25 day notice period of Rule 2002(b) as a
time period which may not be reduced under Rule 9006(c)(2). This was an error.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1989 AMENDMENT
Prior to 1987, subdivision (a) provided that intermediate weekends and legal holidays would not be counted
in the computation of a time period if the prescribed or allowed time was less than 7 days. This rule was
amended in 1987 to conform to Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) which provides for the exclusion of intermediate
weekends and legal holidays if the time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days. An undesirable result of the
1987 amendment was that 10-day time periods prescribed in the interest of prompt administration of
bankruptcy cases were extended to at least 14 calendar days.
As a result of the present amendment, 10-day time periods prescribed or allowed will no longer be extended
to at least 14 calendar days because of intermediate weekends and legal holidays.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
As a result of the 1989 amendment to this rule, the method of computing time under subdivision (a) is not
the same as the method of computing time under Rule 6(a) F.R.Civ.P. Subdivision (a) is amended to provide
that it governs the computation of time periods prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure when the
Bankruptcy Rules make a civil rule applicable to a bankruptcy case or proceeding.
Subdivision (b)(2) is amended because of the deletion of Rule 1019(2). Reference to Rule 9015(f) is deleted
because of the abrogation of Rule 9015 in 1987.
Subdivision (b)(3) is amended to limit the enlargement of time regarding dismissal of a chapter 7 case for
substantial abuse in accordance with Rule 1017(e).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1996 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (c)(2) is amended to conform to the abrogation of Rule 2002(a)(4) and the renumbering of Rule
2002(a)(8) to Rule 2002(a)(7).
GAP Report on Rule 9006. No changes since publication, except for a stylistic change.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
Rule 9006(b)(2) is amended to conform to the abrogation of Rule 1017(b)(3).
GAP Report on Rule 9006. The proposed amendment to Rule 9006(b)(2) has been added as a technical
change to conform to the abrogation of Rule 1017(b)(3). The proposed amendment to Rule 9006(c)(2),
providing that the time under Rule 1019(6) to file a request for payment of an administrative expense after a
case is converted to chapter 7 could not be reduced by the court, was deleted. The proposed amendments to
Rule 1019(6) have been changed so that the court will fix the time for filing the request for payment. Since the
court will fix the time limit, the court should have the power to reduce it. See GAP Report to Rule 1019(6).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2001 AMENDMENT
Rule 5(b) F. R. Civ. P., which is made applicable in adversary proceedings by Rule 7005, is being restyled
and amended to authorize service by electronic means—or any other means not otherwise authorized under
Rule 5(b)—if consent is obtained from the person served. The amendment to Rule 9006(f) is intended to
[Release Point 118-106]
extend the three-day "mail rule" to service under Rule 5(b)(2)(D), including service by electronic means. The
three-day rule also will apply to service under Rule 5(b)(2)(C) F. R. Civ. P. when the person served has no
known address and the paper is served by leaving a copy with the clerk of the court.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2005 AMENDMENT
Rule 9006(f) is amended, consistent with a corresponding amendment to Rule 6(e) of the F.R. Civ. P., to
clarify the method of counting the number of days to respond after service either by mail or under Civil Rule
5(b)(2)(C) or (D). Three days are added after the prescribed period expires. If, before the application of Rule
9006(f), the prescribed period is less than 8 days, intervening Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are
excluded from the calculation under Rule 9006(a). Some illustrations may be helpful.
Under existing Rule 9006(a), assuming that there are no legal holidays and that a response is due in seven
days, if a paper is filed on a Monday, the seven day response period commences on Tuesday and concludes on
Wednesday of the next week. Adding three days to the end of the period would extend it to Saturday, but
because the response period ends on a weekend, the response day would be the following Monday, two weeks
after the filing of the initial paper. If the paper is filed on a Tuesday, the seven-day response period would end
on the following Thursday, and the response time would also be the following Monday. If the paper is mailed
on a Wednesday, the initial seven-day period would expire nine days later on a Friday, but the response would
again be due on the following Monday because of Rule 9006(f). If the paper is mailed on a Thursday,
however, the seven day period ends on Monday, eleven days after the mailing of the service because of the
exclusion of the two intervening Saturdays and Sundays. The response is due three days later on the following
Thursday. If the paper is mailed on a Friday, the seven day period would conclude on a Tuesday, and the
response is due three days later on a Friday.
No other change in the system of counting time is intended.
Other changes are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. The phrase "would otherwise expire under Rule 9006(a)"
was added to the end of the rule to clarify further that the three day extension is to be added to the end of the
period that is established under the counting provisions of Rule 9006(a). This also maintains a parallel
construction with Civil Rule 6(e) in which the same addition to the rule was made after the public comment
period.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (b)(3) is amended to implement §1116(3) of the Code, as amended by the 2005 amendments,
which places specific limits on the extension of time for filing schedules and statements of financial affairs in
a small business case.
Subdivisions (b)(3) and (c)(2) are amended to provide that enlargement or reduction of the time to file the
statement of completion of a personal financial management course required by Rule 1007(b)(7) are governed
by Rule 1007(c). Likewise, the amendments to subdivisions (b)(3) and (c)(2) recognize that the enlargement
of time to file a reaffirmation agreement is governed by Rule 4008(a), and that reduction of the time provided
under that rule is not permitted.
Other amendments are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication. Subdivision (b)(3) was amended to provide that Rule 9006 does not
govern the enlargement of time to file a reaffirmation agreement, the statement required under Rule
1007(b)(7), or the time to file schedules and statements of financial affairs in small business cases. The title of
subdivision (b)(3) was also amended to more accurately describe the operation of the provision. Subdivision
(c)(2) was amended to recognize that the court may not reduce the time under Rule 1007(c) to file the
statement required by Rule 1007(b)(7).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) has been amended to simplify and clarify the provisions that describe how
deadlines are computed. Subdivision (a) governs the computation of any time period found in a Federal Rule
of Bankruptcy Procedure, a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, a statute, a local rule, or a court order. In
accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 9029(a), a local rule may not direct that a deadline be computed in a
manner inconsistent with subdivision (a).
The time-computation provisions of subdivision (a) apply only when a time period must be computed. They
do not apply when a fixed time to act is set. The amendments thus carry forward the approach taken in
Violette v. P.A. Days, Inc., 427 F.3d 1015, 1016 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding that Civil Rule 6(a) "does not apply
to situations where the court has established a specific calendar day as a deadline"), and reject the contrary
holding of In re American Healthcare Management, Inc., 900 F.2d 827, 832 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding that
[Release Point 118-106]
Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a) governs treatment of date-certain deadline set by court order). If, for example, the
date for filing is "no later than November 1, 2007," subdivision (a) does not govern. But if a filing is required
to be made "within 10 days" or "within 72 hours," subdivision (a) describes how that deadline is computed.
Subdivision (a) does not apply when computing a time period set by a statute if the statute specifies a
method of computing time. See, e.g., 11 U.S.C. §527(a)(2) (debt relief agencies must provide a written notice
to an assisted person "not later than 3 business days" after providing bankruptcy assistance services).
Subdivision (a)(1). New subdivision (a)(1) addresses the computation of time periods that are stated in days.
It also applies to time periods that are stated in weeks, months, or years. See, e.g., Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 60(c)(1) made applicable to bankruptcy cases under Rule 9024. Subdivision (a)(1)(B)'s directive to
"count every day" is relevant only if the period is stated in days (not weeks, months, or years).
Under former Rule 9006(a), a period of eight days or more was computed differently than a period of less
than eight days. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays were included in computing the longer
periods, but excluded in computing the shorter periods. Former Rule 9006(a) thus made computing deadlines
unnecessarily complicated and led to counterintuitive results.
Under new subdivision (a)(1), all deadlines stated in days (no matter the length) are computed in the same
way. The day of the event that triggers the deadline is not counted. All other days—including intermediate
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays—are counted, with only one exception: If the period ends on a
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline falls on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or
legal holiday. An illustration is provided below in the discussion of subdivision (a)(5). Subdivision (a)(3)
addresses filing deadlines that expire on a day when the clerk's office is inaccessible.
Where subdivision (a) formerly referred to the "act, event, or default" that triggers the deadline, new
subdivision (a) refers simply to the "event" that triggers the deadline; this change in terminology is adopted
for brevity and simplicity, and is not intended to change meaning.
Periods previously expressed as less than eight days will be shortened as a practical matter by the decision
to count intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in computing all periods. Many of those periods
have been lengthened to compensate for the change. See, e.g., Rules 2008 (trustee's duty to notify court of
acceptance of the appointment within five days is extended to seven days); 6004(b) (time for filing and service
of objection to proposed use, sale or lease of property extended from five days prior to the hearing to seven
days prior to the hearing); and 9006(d) (time for giving notice of a hearing extended from five days prior to
the hearing to seven days).
Most of the 10-day periods were adjusted to meet the change in computation method by setting 14 days as
the new period. See, e.g., Rules 1007(h) (10-day period to file supplemental schedule for property debtor
becomes entitled to acquire after the commencement of the case is extended to 14 days); 3020(e) (10-day stay
of order confirming a chapter 11 plan extended to 14 days); 8002(a) (10-day period in which to file notice of
appeal extended to 14 days). A 14-day period also has the advantage that the final day falls on the same day of
the week as the event that triggered the period—the14th day after a Monday, for example, is a Monday. This
advantage of using week-long periods led to adopting seven-day periods to replace some of the periods set at
less than 10 days, 21-day periods to replace 20-day periods, and 28-day periods to replace 25-day
periods.Thirty-day and longer periods, however, were generally retained without change.
Subdivision (a)(2). New subdivision (a)(2) addresses the computation of time periods that are stated in
hours. No such deadline currently appears in the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. But some statutes
contain deadlines stated in hours, as do some court orders issued in expedited proceedings.
Under subdivision (a)(2), a deadline stated in hours starts to run immediately on the occurrence of the event
that triggers the deadline. The deadline generally ends when the time expires. If, however, the time period
expires at a specific time (say, 2:17 p.m.) on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline is
extended to the same time (2:17 p.m.) on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Periods
stated in hours are not to be "rounded up" to the next whole hour. Subdivision (a)(3) addresses situations when
the clerk's office is inaccessible during the last hour before a filing deadline expires.
Subdivision (a)(2)(B) directs that every hour be counted. Thus, for example, a 72-hour period that
commences at 10:23 a.m. on Friday, November 2, 2007, will run until 9:23 a.m. on Monday, November 5; the
discrepancy in start and end times in this example results from the intervening shift from daylight saving time
to standard time.
Subdivision (a)(3). When determining the last day of a filing period stated in days or a longer unit of time, a
day on which the clerk's office is not accessible because of the weather or another reason is treated like a
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. When determining the end of a filing period stated in hours, if the clerk's
office is inaccessible during the last hour of the filing period computed under subdivision (a)(2) then the
period is extended to the same time on the next day that is not a weekend, holiday, or day when the clerk's
office is inaccessible.
[Release Point 118-106]
Subdivision (a)(3)'s extensions apply "[u]nless the court orders otherwise." In some circumstances, the
court might not wish a period of inaccessibility to trigger a full 24-hour extension; in those instances, the court
can specify a briefer extension.
The text of the rule no longer refers to "weather or other conditions" as the reason for the inaccessibility of
the clerk's office. The reference to "weather" was deleted from the text to underscore that inaccessibility can
occur for reasons unrelated to weather, such as an outage of the electronic filing system. Weather can still be a
reason for inaccessibility of the clerk's office. The rule does not attempt to define inaccessibility. Rather, the
concept will continue to develop through caselaw. See, e.g., William G. Phelps, When Is Office of Clerk of
Court Inaccessible Due to Weather or Other Conditions for Purpose of Computing Time Period for Filing
Papers under Rule 6(a) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 135 A.L.R. Fed. 259 (1996) (collecting cases). In
addition, many local provisions address inaccessibility for purposes of electronic filing. See, e.g., D. Kan.
Rule 5.4.11 ("A Filing User whose filing is made untimely as the result of a technical failure may seek
appropriate relief from the court.").
Subdivision (a)(4). New subdivision (a)(4) defines the end of the last day of a period for purposes of
subdivision (a)(1). Subdivision (a)(4) does not apply in computing periods stated in hours under subdivision
(a)(2), and does not apply if a different time is set by a statute, local rule, or order in the case. A local rule may
provide, for example, that papers filed in a drop box after the normal hours of the clerk's office are filed as of
the day that is date-stamped on the papers by a device in the drop box.
28 U.S.C. §452 provides that "[a]ll courts of the United States shall be deemed always open for the purpose
of filing proper papers, issuing and returning process, and making motions and orders." A corresponding
provision exists in Rule 5001(a). Some courts have held that these provisions permit an after-hours filing by
handing the papers to an appropriate official. See, e.g., Casalduc v. Diaz, 117 F.2d 915, 917 (1st Cir. 1941).
Subdivision (a)(4) does not address the effect of the statute on the question of after-hours filing; instead, the
rule is designed to deal with filings in the ordinary course without regard to Section 452.
Subdivision (a)(5). New subdivision (a)(5) defines the "next" day for purposes of subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and
(a)(2)(C). The Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure contain both forward-looking time periods and
backward-looking time periods. A forward-looking time period requires something to be done within a period
of time after an event. See, e.g., Rules 1007(c) (["]the schedules, statements, and other documents shall be
filed by the debtor within 14 days of the entry of the order for relief"); 1019(5)(B)(ii) ("the trustee, not later
than 30 days after conversion of the case, shall file and transmit to the United States trustee a final report and
account"); and 7012(a) ("If a complaint is duly served, the defendant shall serve an answer within 30 days
after the issuance of the summons, except when a different time is prescribed by the court.").
A backward-looking time period requires something to be done within a period of time before an event.
See, e.g., Rules 6004(b) ("an objection to a proposed use, sale, or lease of property shall be filed and served
not less than seven days before the date set for the proposed action"); 9006(d) ("A written motion, other than
one which may be heard ex parte, and notice of any hearing shall be served not later than seven days before
the time specified for such hearing"). In determining what is the "next" day for purposes of subdivisions
(a)(1)(C) and (a)(2)(C), one should continue counting in the same direction—that is, forward when computing
a forward-looking period and backward when computing a backward-looking period. If, for example, a filing
is due within 10 days after an event, and the tenth day falls on Saturday, September 1, 2007, then the filing is
due on Tuesday, September 4, 2007 (Monday, September 3, is Labor Day). But if a filing is due 10 days
before an event, and the tenth day falls on Saturday, September 1, then the filing is due on Friday, August 31.
Subdivision (a)(6). New subdivision (a)(6) defines "legal holiday" for purposes of the Federal Rules of
Bankruptcy Procedure, including the time-computation provisions of subdivision (a). Subdivision (a)(6)
continues to include within the definition of "legal holiday" days that are declared a holiday by the President
or Congress.
For forward-counted periods—i.e., periods that are measured after an event—subdivision (a)(6)(C) includes
certain state holidays within the definition of legal holidays, and defines the term "state"—for purposes of
subdivision (a)(6)—to include the District of Columbia and any commonwealth or territory of the United
States. Thus, for purposes of subdivision (a)(6)'s definition of "legal holiday," "state" includes the District of
Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
However, state legal holidays are not recognized in computing backward-counted periods. For both
forward- and backward-counted periods, the rule thus protects those who may be unsure of the effect of state
holidays. For forward-counted deadlines, treating state holidays the same as federal holidays extends the
deadline. Thus, someone who thought that the federal courts might be closed on a state holiday would be
safeguarded against an inadvertent late filing. In contrast, for backward-counted deadlines, not giving state
holidays the treatment of federal holidays allows filing on the state holiday itself rather than the day before.
[Release Point 118-106]
Take, for example, Monday, April 21, 2008 (Patriot's Day, a legal holiday in the relevant state). If a filing is
due 14 days after an event, and the fourteenth day is April 21, then the filing is due on Tuesday, April 22
because Monday, April 21 counts as a legal holiday. But if a filing is due 14 days before an event, and the
fourteenth day is April 21, the filing is due on Monday, April 21; the fact that April 21 is a state holiday does
not make April 21 a legal holiday for purposes of computing this backward-counted deadline. But note that if
the clerk's office is inaccessible on Monday, April 21, then subdivision (a)(3) extends the April 21 filing
deadline forward to the next accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday—no earlier than
Tuesday, April 22.
Changes Made After Publication. The reference to Rule 6(a)(1) in subdivision (a)(3)(A) at line 50 of the
rule as it was published was corrected by referring instead to Rule 9006(a)(1).
The Standing Committee changed Rule 9006(a)(6) to exclude state holidays from the definition of "legal
holiday" for purposes of computing backward-counted periods; conforming changes were made to the
Committee Note to subdivision (a)(6). In addition, the term "possession" was deleted from the definition of
"state" in subdivision (a)(6), and a conforming change was made to the Committee Note.
[Subdivision (d).] The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule
9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to
substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the
following manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
Subdivision (f) is amended to conform to the changes made to Rule 5(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure as a part of the Civil Rules Restyling Project. As a part of that project, subparagraphs (b)(2)(C) and
(D) of that rule were rewritten as subparagraphs (b)(2)(D), (E), and (F). The cross reference to those rules
contained in subdivision (f) of this rule is corrected by this amendment.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2013 AMENDMENT
The title of this rule is amended to draw attention to the fact that it prescribes time limits for the service of
motion papers. These time periods apply unless another Bankruptcy Rule or a court order, including a local
rule, prescribes different time periods. Rules 9013 and 9014 should also be consulted regarding motion
practice. Rule 9013 governs the form of motions and the parties who must be served. Rule 9014 prescribes the
procedures applicable to contested matters, including the method of serving motions commencing contested
matters and subsequent papers. Subdivision (d) is amended to apply to any written response to a motion,
rather than just to opposing affidavits. The caption of the subdivision is amended to reflect this change. Other
changes are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2016 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (f) is amended to remove service by electronic means under Civil Rule 5(b)(2)(E) from the
modes of service that allow three added days to act after being served.
Rule 9006(f) and Civil Rule 6(d) contain similar provisions providing additional time for actions after being
served by mail or by certain modes of service that are identified by reference to Civil Rule 5(b)(2). Rule
9006(f)—like Civil Rule 6(d)—is amended to remove the reference to service by electronic means under Rule
5(b)(2)(E). The amendment also adds clarifying parentheticals identifying the forms of service under Rule
5(b)(2) for which three days will still be added.
Civil Rule 5(b)—made applicable in bankruptcy proceedings by Rules 7005 and 9014(b)—was amended in
2001 to allow service by electronic means with the consent of the person served. Although electronic
transmission seemed virtually instantaneous even then, electronic service was included in the modes of service
that allow three added days to act after being served. There were concerns that the transmission might be
delayed for some time, and particular concerns that incompatible systems might make it difficult or impossible
to open attachments. Those concerns have been substantially alleviated by advances in technology and
widespread skill in using electronic transmission.
A parallel reason for allowing the three added days was that electronic service was authorized only with the
consent of the person to be served. Concerns about the reliability of electronic transmission might have led to
refusals of consent; the three added days were calculated to alleviate these concerns.
Diminution of the concerns that prompted the decision to allow the three added days for electronic
transmission is not the only reason for discarding this indulgence. Many rules have been changed to ease the
[Release Point 118-106]
task of computing time by adopting 7-, 14-, 21-, and 28-day periods that allow "day-of-the-week" counting.
Adding three days at the end complicated the counting, and increased the occasions for further complication
by invoking the provisions that apply when the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
Electronic service after business hours, or just before or during a weekend or holiday, may result in a
practical reduction in the time available to respond. Extensions of time may be warranted to prevent prejudice.
Eliminating Rule 5(b) subparagraph (2)(E) from the modes of service that allow three added days means
that the three added days cannot be retained by consenting to service by electronic means. Consent to
electronic service in registering for electronic case filing, for example, does not count as consent to service
"by any other means" of delivery under subparagraph (F).
Subdivision (f) is also amended to conform to a corresponding amendment of Civil Rule 6(d). The
amendment clarifies that only the party that is served by mail or under the specified provisions of Civil Rule
5—and not the party making service—is permitted to add three days to any prescribed period for taking action
after service is made.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2023 AMENDMENT
The amendment adds "Juneteenth National Independence Day" to the list of legal holidays. See Juneteenth
National Independence Day Act, P.L. 117–17 (2021) (amending 5 U.S.C. §6103(a)).

Rule 9007. General Authority to Regulate Notices
When notice is to be given under these rules, the court shall designate, if not otherwise specified
herein, the time within which, the entities to whom, and the form and manner in which the notice
shall be given. When feasible, the court may order any notices under these rules to be combined.

Rule 9009. Forms
(a) OFFICIAL FORMS. The Official Forms prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United
States shall be used without alteration, except as otherwise provided in these rules, in a particular
Official Form, or in the national instructions for a particular Official Form. Official Forms may be
modified to permit minor changes not affecting wording or the order of presenting information,
including changes that:
(1) expand the prescribed areas for responses in order to permit complete responses;
(2) delete space not needed for responses; or
(3) delete items requiring detail in a question or category if the filer indicates—either by
checking "no" or "none" or by stating in words—that there is nothing to report on that question or
category.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
The rule continues the obligatory character of the Official Forms in the interest of facilitating the processing
of the paperwork of bankruptcy administration, but provides that Official Forms will be prescribed by the
Judicial Conference of the United States. The Supreme Court and the Congress will thus be relieved of the
burden of considering the large number of complex forms used in bankruptcy practice. The use of the Official
Forms has generally been held subject to a "rule of substantial compliance" and some of these rules, for
example Rule 1002, specifically state that the filed document need only "conform substantially" to the Official
Form. See also Rule 9005. The second sentence recognizes the propriety of combining and rearranging
Official Forms to take advantage of technological developments and resulting economies.
The Director of the Administrative Office is authorized to issue additional forms for the guidance of the bar.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Rule 9029 [9009] is amended to clarify that local court rules may not prohibit or limit the use of the Official
Forms.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2008 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to provide that a plan proponent in a small business chapter 11 case need not use an
Official Form of a plan of reorganization and disclosure statement. The use of those forms is optional, and
under Rule 3016(d) the proponent may submit a plan and disclosure statement in those cases that does not
conform to the Official Forms.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes were made after publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2017 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended and reorganized into separate subdivisions.
Subdivision (a) addresses permissible modifications to Official Forms. It requires that an Official Form be
used without alteration, except when another rule, the Official Form itself, or the national instructions
applicable to an Official Form permit alteration. The former language generally permitting alterations has
been deleted, but the rule preserves the ability to make minor modifications to an Official Form that do not
affect the wording or the order in which information is presented on a form. Permissible changes include those
that merely expand or delete the space for responses as appropriate or delete inapplicable items so long as the
filer indicates that no response is intended. For example, when more space will be necessary to completely
answer a question on an Official Form without an attachment, the answer space may be expanded. Similarly,
varying the width or orientation of columnar data on a form for clarity of presentation would be a permissible
minor change. On the other hand, many Official Forms indicate on their face that certain changes are not
appropriate. Any changes that contravene the directions on an Official Form would be prohibited by this rule.
The creation of subdivision (b) and subdivision (c) is stylistic.
Rule 9010. Representation and Appearances; Powers of Attorney
(a) AUTHORITY TO ACT PERSONALLY OR BY ATTORNEY. A debtor, creditor, equity
security holder, indenture trustee, committee or other party may (1) appear in a case under the Code
and act either in the entity's own behalf or by an attorney authorized to practice in the court, and (2)
perform any act not constituting the practice of law, by an authorized agent, attorney in fact, or
proxy.
(b) NOTICE OF APPEARANCE. An attorney appearing for a party in a case under the Code shall
file a notice of appearance with the attorney's name, office address and telephone number, unless the
attorney's appearance is otherwise noted in the record.
(c) POWER OF ATTORNEY. The authority of any agent, attorney in fact, or proxy to represent a
creditor for any purpose other than the execution and filing of a proof of claim or the acceptance or
rejection of a plan shall be evidenced by a power of attorney conforming substantially to the
appropriate Official Form. The execution of any such power of attorney shall be acknowledged
before one of the officers enumerated in 28 U.S.C. §459, §953, Rule 9012, or a person authorized to
administer oaths under the laws of the state where the oath is administered.

References to Official Form numbers in subdivision (c) are deleted in anticipation of future revision and
renumbering of the Official Forms.
Rule 9011. Signing of Papers; Representations to the Court; Sanctions;
Verification and Copies of Papers
(a) SIGNATURE. Every petition, pleading, written motion, and other paper, except a list,
schedule, or statement, or amendments thereto, shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in
the attorney's individual name. A party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign all papers.
Each paper shall state the signer's address and telephone number, if any. An unsigned paper shall be
stricken unless omission of the signature is corrected promptly after being called to the attention of
the attorney or party.
(b) REPRESENTATIONS TO THE COURT. By presenting to the court (whether by signing,
filing, submitting, or later advocating) a petition, pleading, written motion, or other paper, an
attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person's knowledge, information,
and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,— 1
(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary
delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation;
(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by
a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the
establishment of new law;
(3) the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so
identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further
investigation or discovery; and
(4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so
identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.
(c) SANCTIONS. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines
that subdivision (b) has been violated, the court may, subject to the conditions stated below, impose
an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated subdivision (b) or
are responsible for the violation.
(1) How Initiated.
(A) By Motion. A motion for sanctions under this rule shall be made separately from other
motions or requests and shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision (b). It
shall be served as provided in Rule 7004. The motion for sanctions may not be filed with or
presented to the court unless, within 21 days after service of the motion (or such other period as
the court may prescribe), the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial
is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected, except that this limitation shall not apply if the
conduct alleged is the filing of a petition in violation of subdivision (b). If warranted, the court
may award to the party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees
incurred in presenting or opposing the motion. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm
shall be held jointly responsible for violations committed by its partners, associates, and
employees.
[Release Point 118-106]
(B) On Court's Initiative. On its own initiative, the court may enter an order describing the
specific conduct that appears to violate subdivision (b) and directing an attorney, law firm, or
party to show cause why it has not violated subdivision (b) with respect thereto.
(2) Nature of Sanction; Limitations. A sanction imposed for violation of this rule shall be
limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others
similarly situated. Subject to the limitations in subparagraphs (A) and (B), the sanction may
consist of, or include, directives of a nonmonetary nature, an order to pay a penalty into court, or,
if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the
movant of some or all of the reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred as a direct
result of the violation.
(A) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded against a represented party for a violation of
subdivision (b)(2).
(B) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded on the court's initiative unless the court issues its
order to show cause before a voluntary dismissal or settlement of the claims made by or against
the party which is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned.
(3) Order. When imposing sanctions, the court shall describe the conduct determined to
constitute a violation of this rule and explain the basis for the sanction imposed.
(d) INAPPLICABILITY TO DISCOVERY. Subdivisions (a) through (c) of this rule do not apply
to disclosures and discovery requests, responses, objections, and motions that are subject to the
provisions of Rules 7026 through 7037.
(e) VERIFICATION. Except as otherwise specifically provided by these rules, papers filed in a
case under the Code need not be verified. Whenever verification is required by these rules, an
unsworn declaration as provided in 28 U.S.C. §1746 satisfies the requirement of verification.
(f) COPIES OF SIGNED OR VERIFIED PAPERS. When these rules require copies of a signed or
verified paper, it shall suffice if the original is signed or verified and the copies are conformed to the
original.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 11, 1997, eff.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a). Excepted from the papers which an attorney for a debtor must sign are lists, schedules,
statements of financial affairs, statements of executory contracts, Chapter 13 Statements and amendments
thereto. Rule 1008 requires that these documents be verified by the debtor. Although the petition must also be
verified, counsel for the debtor must sign the petition. See Official Form No. 1. An unrepresented party must
sign all papers.
The last sentence of this subdivision authorizes a broad range of sanctions.
The word "document" is used in this subdivision to refer to all papers which the attorney or party is
required to sign.
Subdivision (b) extends to all papers filed in cases under the Code the policy of minimizing reliance on the
formalities of verification which is reflected in the third sentence of Rule 11 F.R.Civ.P. The second sentence
of subdivision (b) permits the substitution of an unsworn declaration for the verification. See 28 U.S.C. §1746.
Rules requiring verification or an affidavit are as follows: Rule 1008, petitions, schedules, statements of
financial affairs, Chapter 13 Statements and amendments; Rule 2006(e), list of multiple proxies and statement
of facts and circumstances regarding their acquisition; Rule 4001(c), motion for ex parte relief from stay; Rule
7065, incorporating Rule 65(b) F.R.Civ.P. governing issuance of temporary restraining order; Rule 8011(d),
affidavit in support of emergency motion on appeal.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
The statement of intention of the debtor under §521(2) of the Code is added to the documents which
counsel is not required to sign.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) is amended to conform to Rule 11 F.R.Civ.P. where appropriate, but also to clarify that it
[Release Point 118-106]
applies to the unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of the administration of the case. Deletion of
the references to specific statements that are excluded from the scope of this subdivision is stylistic. As used
in subdivision (a) of this rule, "statement" is limited to the statement of financial affairs and the statement of
intention required to be filed under Rule 1007. Deletion of the reference to the Chapter 13 Statement is
consistent with the amendment to Rule 1007(b).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1997 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to conform to the 1993 changes to F.R.Civ.P. 11. For an explanation of these
amendments, see the advisory committee note to the 1993 amendments to F.R.Civ.P. 11.
The "safe harbor" provision contained in subdivision (c)(1)(A), which prohibits the filing of a motion for
sanctions unless the challenged paper is not withdrawn or corrected within a prescribed time after service of
the motion, does not apply if the challenged paper is a petition. The filing of a petition has immediate serious
consequences, including the imposition of the automatic stay under §362 of the Code, which may not be
avoided by the subsequent withdrawal of the petition. In addition, a petition for relief under chapter 7 or
chapter 11 may not be withdrawn unless the court orders dismissal of the case for cause after notice and a
hearing.
GAP Report on Rule 9011. The proposed amendments to subdivision (a) were revised to clarify that a party
not represented by an attorney must sign lists, schedules, and statements, as well as other papers that are filed.
1 So in original. The comma probably should not appear.
Rule 9012. Oaths and Affirmations
(a) PERSONS AUTHORIZED TO ADMINISTER OATHS. The following persons may
administer oaths and affirmations and take acknowledgments: a bankruptcy judge, clerk, deputy
clerk, United States trustee, officer authorized to administer oaths in proceedings before the courts of
the United States or under the laws of the state where the oath is to be taken, or a diplomatic or
consular officer of the United States in any foreign country.
(b) AFFIRMATION IN LIEU OF OATH. When in a case under the Code an oath is required to be
taken a solemn affirmation may be accepted in lieu thereof.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from Rule 43(d) F.R.Civ.P.
The provisions of former Bankruptcy Rule 912(a) relating to who may administer oaths have been deleted
as unnecessary. Bankruptcy judges and the clerks and deputy clerks of bankruptcy courts are authorized by
statute to administer oaths and affirmations and to take acknowledgments. 28 U.S.C. §§459, 953. A person
designated to preside at the meeting of creditors has authority under Rule 2003(b)(1) to administer the oath.
Administration of the oath at a deposition is governed by Rule 7028.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a) has been added to the rule to authorize bankruptcy judges and clerks to administer oaths.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to conform to the 1986 amendment to §343 which provides that the United States
trustee may administer the oath to the debtor at the §341 meeting. This rule also allows the United States
trustee to administer oaths and affirmations and to take acknowledgments in other situations. This amendment
also affects Rule 9010(c) relating to the acknowledgment of a power of attorney. The words "United States
trustee" include a designee of the United States trustee pursuant to Rule 9001 and §102(9) of the Code.
Rule 9013. Motions: Form and Service
A request for an order, except when an application is authorized by the rules, shall be by written
motion, unless made during a hearing. The motion shall state with particularity the grounds therefor,
and shall set forth the relief or order sought. Every written motion, other than one which may be
[Release Point 118-106]
considered ex parte, shall be served by the moving party within the time determined under Rule
9006(d). The moving party shall serve the motion on:
(a) the trustee or debtor in possession and on those entities specified by these rules; or
(b) the entities the court directs if these rules do not require service or specify the entities to be
served.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 16, 2013, eff. Dec. 1, 2013.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is derived from Rule 5(a) and Rule 7(b)(1) F.R.Civ.P. Except when an application is specifically
authorized by these rules, for example an application under Rule 2014 for approval of the employment of a
professional, all requests for court action must be made by motion.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2013 AMENDMENT
A cross-reference to Rule 9006(d) is added to this rule to call attention to the time limits for the service of
motions, supporting affidavits, and written responses to motions. Rule 9006(d) prescribes time limits that
apply unless other limits are fixed by these rules, a court order, or a local rule. The other changes are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
Rule 9014. Contested Matters
(a) MOTION. In a contested matter not otherwise governed by these rules, relief shall be
requested by motion, and reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing shall be afforded the party
against whom relief is sought. No response is required under this rule unless the court directs
otherwise.
(b) SERVICE. The motion shall be served in the manner provided for service of a summons and
complaint by Rule 7004 and within the time determined under Rule 9006(d). Any written response to
the motion shall be served within the time determined under Rule 9006(d). Any paper served after
the motion shall be served in the manner provided by Rule 5(b) F.R.Civ.P.
(c) APPLICATION OF PART VII RULES. Except as otherwise provided in this rule, and unless
the court directs otherwise, the following rules shall apply: 7009, 7017, 7021, 7025, 7026,
7028–7037, 7041, 7042, 7052, 7054–7056, 7064, 7069, and 7071. The following subdivisions of
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26, as incorporated by Rule 7026, shall not apply in a contested matter unless the
court directs otherwise: 26(a)(1) (mandatory disclosure), 26(a)(2) (disclosures regarding expert
testimony) and 26(a)(3) (additional pre-trial disclosure), and 26(f) (mandatory meeting before
scheduling conference/discovery plan). An entity that desires to perpetuate testimony may proceed in
the same manner as provided in Rule 7027 for the taking of a deposition before an adversary
proceeding. The court may at any stage in a particular matter direct that one or more of the other
rules in Part VII shall apply. The court shall give the parties notice of any order issued under this
paragraph to afford them a reasonable opportunity to comply with the procedures prescribed by the
order.
(d) TESTIMONY OF WITNESSES. Testimony of witnesses with respect to disputed material
factual issues shall be taken in the same manner as testimony in an adversary proceeding.
(e) ATTENDANCE OF WITNESSES. The court shall provide procedures that enable parties to
ascertain at a reasonable time before any scheduled hearing whether the hearing will be an
evidentiary hearing at which witnesses may testify.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 1999, eff. Dec. 1, 1999; Apr. 29, 2002, eff.
Dec. 1, 2002; Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004; Apr. 16, 2013, eff. Dec. 1, 2013.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Rules 1017(d), 3020(b)(1), 4001(a), 4003(d), and 6006(a), which govern respectively dismissal or
conversion of a case, objections to confirmation of a plan, relief from the automatic stay and the use of cash
collateral, avoidance of a lien under §552(f) of the Code, and the assumption or rejection of executory
contracts or unexpired leases, specifically provide that litigation under those rules shall be as provided in Rule
9014. This rule also governs litigation in other contested matters.
[Release Point 118-106]
Whenever there is an actual dispute, other than an adversary proceeding, before the bankruptcy court, the
litigation to resolve that dispute is a contested matter. For example, the filing of an objection to a proof of
claim, to a claim of exemption, or to a disclosure statement creates a dispute which is a contested matter. Even
when an objection is not formally required, there may be a dispute. If a party in interest opposes the amount of
compensation sought by a professional, there is a dispute which is a contested matter.
When the rules of Part VII are applicable to a contested matter, reference in the Part VII rules to adversary
proceedings is to be read as a reference to a contested matter. See Rule 9002(1).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—1999 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to delete Rule 7062 from the list of Part VII rules that automatically apply in a
contested matter.
Rule 7062 provides that Rule 62 F.R.Civ.P., which governs stays of proceedings to enforce a judgment, is
applicable in adversary proceedings. The provisions of Rule 62, including the ten-day automatic stay of the
enforcement of a judgment provided by Rule 62(a) and the stay as a matter of right by posting a supersedeas
bond provided in Rule 62(d), are not appropriate for most orders granting or denying motions governed by
Rule 9014.
Although Rule 7062 will not apply automatically in contested matters, the amended rule permits the court,
in its discretion, to order that Rule 7062 apply in a particular matter, and Rule 8005 gives the court discretion
to issue a stay or any other appropriate order during the pendency of an appeal on such terms as will protect
the rights of all parties in interest. In addition, amendments to Rules 3020, 4001, 6004, and 6006 automatically
stay certain types of orders for a period of ten days, unless the court orders otherwise.
GAP Report on Rule 9014. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2002 AMENDMENT
The list of Part VII rules that are applicable in a contested matter is extended to include Rule 7009 on
pleading special matters, and Rule 7017 on real parties in interest, infants and incompetent persons, and
capacity. The discovery rules made applicable in adversary proceedings apply in contested matters unless the
court directs otherwise.
Subdivision (b) is amended to permit parties to serve papers, other than the original motion, in the manner
provided in Rule 5(b) F.R. Civ.P. When the court requires a response to the motion, this amendment will
permit service of the response in the same manner as an answer is served in an adversary proceeding.
Subdivision (d) is added to clarify that if the motion cannot be decided without resolving a disputed material
issue of fact, an evidentiary hearing must be held at which testimony of witnesses is taken in the same manner
as testimony is taken in an adversary proceeding or at a trial in a district court civil case. Rule 43(a), rather
than Rule 43(e), F.R. Civ.P. would govern the evidentiary hearing on the factual dispute. Under Rule 9017,
the Federal Rules of Evidence also apply in a contested matter. Nothing in the rule prohibits a court from
resolving any matter that is submitted on affidavits by agreement of the parties.
Subdivision (e). Local procedures for hearings and other court appearances in a contested matter vary from
district to district. In some bankruptcy courts, an evidentiary hearing at which witnesses may testify usually is
held at the first court appearance in the contested matter. In other courts, it is customary for the court to delay
the evidentiary hearing on disputed factual issues until some time after the initial hearing date. In order to
avoid unnecessary expense and inconvenience, it is important for attorneys to know whether they should bring
witnesses to a court appearance. The purpose of the final sentence of this rule is to require that the court
provide a mechanism that will enable attorneys to know at a reasonable time before a scheduled hearing
whether it will be necessary for witnesses to appear in court on that particular date.
Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments:
The Advisory Committee made two changes to subdivision (d) after considering the comments received
addressing the proposed rule. First, the word "material" is inserted to make explicit that which was implied in
the published version of the proposed rule. Second, the reference to F.R.Civ.P. 43(a) was removed. The
purpose of proposed subdivision (d) was to recognize that testimony should be taken in the same manner in
both contested matters and adversary proceedings. The revision to the published rule states this more directly.
The Committee Note was amended to reflect the changes made in the text of the rule.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2004 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to provide that the mandatory disclosure requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 26, as
incorporated by Rule 7026, do not apply in contested matters. The typically short time between the
[Release Point 118-106]
commencement and resolution of most contested matters makes the mandatory disclosure provisions of Rule
26 ineffective. Nevertheless, the court may by local rule or by order in a particular case provide that these
provisions of the rule apply in a contested matter.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2013 AMENDMENT
A cross-reference to Rule 9006(d) is added to subdivision (b) to call attention to the time limits for the
service of motions, supporting affidavits, and written responses to motions. Rule 9006(d) prescribes time
limits that apply unless other limits are fixed by these rules, a court order, or a local rule.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.

(a) APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. Rules 38, 39,
47–49, and 51, F.R.Civ.P., and Rule 81(c) F.R.Civ.P. insofar as it applies to jury trials, apply in cases
and proceedings, except that a demand made under Rule 38(b) F.R.Civ.P. shall be filed in
accordance with Rule 5005.
(b) CONSENT TO HAVE TRIAL CONDUCTED BY BANKRUPTCY JUDGE. If the right to a
jury trial applies, a timely demand has been filed pursuant to Rule 38(b) F.R.Civ.P., and the
bankruptcy judge has been specially designated to conduct the jury trial, the parties may consent to
have a jury trial conducted by a bankruptcy judge under 28 U.S.C. §157(e) by jointly or separately
filing a statement of consent within any applicable time limits specified by local rule.
(c) APPLICABILITY OF RULE 50 F.R.CIV.P. Rule 50 F.R.Civ.P. applies in cases and
proceedings, except that any renewed motion for judgment or request for a new trial shall be filed no
later than 14 days after the entry of judgment.

trial by jury where such right does not otherwise exist.
GAP Report on Rule 9015. No changes to the published draft.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended by deleting Rule 50 F.R.Civ.P. from the list in subdivision (a) of rules made applicable
in cases and proceedings. However, subdivision (c) is added to make Rule 50 applicable in cases and
proceedings, but it limits the time for filing certain post judgment motions to 14 days after the entry of
judgment. The amendment is necessary because Rule 50 F.R.Civ.P. was amended in 2009 to extend the
deadline for the filing of these post judgment motions to 28 days. That deadline corresponds to the 30-day
deadline for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case under Rule 4(a)(1)(A) F.R.App.P. In a bankruptcy case, the
deadline for filing a notice of appeal is 14 days. Therefore, the 28-day deadline for filing these post judgment
motions would effectively override the notice of appeal deadline under Rule 8002(a) but for this amendment.
Other amendments are stylistic.

research, development, or commercial information, (2) to protect any entity against scandalous or
defamatory matter contained in any paper filed in a case under the Code, or (3) to protect
governmental matters that are made confidential by statute or regulation. If an order is entered under
this rule without notice, any entity affected thereby may move to vacate or modify the order, and
after a hearing on notice the court shall determine the motion.

Rule 9020. Contempt Proceedings
Rule 9014 governs a motion for an order of contempt made by the United States trustee or a party

(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 23, 2001, eff.
Dec. 1, 2001.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Section 1481 of Title 28 provides that a bankruptcy court "may not . . . punish a criminal contempt not
committed in the presence of the judge of the court or warranting a punishment of imprisonment." Rule 9020
does not enlarge the power of bankruptcy courts.
Subdivision (a) is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 920 and Rule 42 F.R.Crim.P. Paragraph (1) of the
subdivision permits summary imposition of punishment for contempt if the conduct is in the presence of the
court and is of such nature that the conduct "obstruct[s] the administration of justice." See 18 U.S.C. §401(a).
Cases interpreting Rule 42(a) F.R.Crim.P. have held that when criminal contempt is in question summary
disposition should be the exception: summary disposition should be reserved for situations where it is
necessary to protect the judicial institution. 3 Wright, Federal Practice & Procedure—Criminal §707 (1969).
Those cases are equally pertinent to the application of this rule and, therefore, contemptuous conduct in the
presence of the judge may often be punished only after the notice and hearing requirements of subdivision (b)
are satisfied.
If the bankruptcy court concludes it is without power to punish or to impose the proper punishment for
conduct which constitutes contempt, subdivision (a)(3) authorizes the bankruptcy court to certify the matter to
the district court.
Subdivision (b) makes clear that when a person has a constitutional or statutory right to a jury trial in a
criminal contempt matter this rule in no way affects that right. See Frank v. United States, 395 U.S. 147
(1969).
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not specifically provide the procedure for the imposition of civil
contempt sanctions. The decisional law governing the procedure for imposition of civil sanctions by the
district courts will be equally applicable to the bankruptcy courts.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
The United States Bankruptcy Courts, as constituted under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, were
courts of law, equity, and admiralty with an inherent contempt power, but former 28 U.S.C. §1481 restricted
the criminal contempt power of bankruptcy judges. Under the 1984 amendments, bankruptcy judges are
judicial officers of the district court, 28 U.S.C. §§151, 152(a)(1). There are no decisions by the courts of
appeals concerning the authority of bankruptcy judges to punish for either civil or criminal contempt under the
1984 amendments. This rule, as amended, recognizes that bankruptcy judges may not have the power to
punish for contempt.
Sound judicial administration requires that the initial determination of whether contempt has been
committed should be made by the bankruptcy judge. If timely objections are not filed to the bankruptcy
[Release Point 118-106]
judge's order, the order has the same force and effect as an order of the district court. If objections are filed
within 10 days of service of the order, the district court conducts a de novo review pursuant to Rule 9033 and
any order of contempt is entered by the district court on completion of the court's review of the bankruptcy
judge's order.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The words "with the clerk" in subdivision (c) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2001 AMENDMENT
The amendments to this rule cover a motion for an order of contempt filed by the United States trustee or a
party in interest. This rule, as amended, does not address a contempt proceeding initiated by the court sua
sponte.
Whether the court is acting on motion under this rule or is acting sua sponte, these amendments are not
intended to extend, limit, or otherwise affect either the contempt power of a bankruptcy judge or the role of
the district judge regarding contempt orders. Issues relating to the contempt power of bankruptcy judges are
substantive and are left to statutory and judicial development, rather than procedural rules.
This rule, as amended in 1987, delayed for ten days from service the effectiveness of a bankruptcy judge's
order of contempt and rendered the order subject to de novo review by the district court. These limitations on
contempt orders were added to the rule in response to the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act
of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98–353, 98 Stat. 333, which provides that bankruptcy judges are judicial officers of the
district court, but does not specifically mention contempt power. See 28 U.S.C. §151. As explained in the
committee note to the 1987 amendments to this rule, no decisions of the courts of appeals existed concerning
the authority of a bankruptcy judge to punish for either civil or criminal contempt under the 1984 Act and,
therefore, the rule as amended in 1987 "recognizes that bankruptcy judges may not have the power to punish
for contempt." Committee Note to 1987 Amendments to Rule 9020.
Since 1987, several courts of appeals have held that bankruptcy judges have the power to issue civil
contempt orders. See, e.g., Matter of Terrebonne Fuel and Lube, Inc., 108 F.3d 609 (5th Cir. 1997); In re
Rainbow Magazine, Inc., 77 F.3d 278 (9th Cir. 1996). Several courts have distinguished between a bankruptcy
judge's civil contempt power and criminal contempt power. See, e.g., Matter of Terrebonne Fuel and Lube,
Inc., 108 F.3d at 613, n. 3 ("[a]lthough we find that bankruptcy judge's [sic] can find a party in civil contempt,
we must point out that bankruptcy courts lack the power to hold persons in criminal contempt."). For other
decisions regarding criminal contempt power, see, e.g., In re Ragar, 3 F.3d 1174 (8th Cir. 1993); Matter of
Hipp, Inc., 895 F.2d 1503 (5th Cir. 1990). To the extent that Rule 9020, as amended in 1987, delayed the
effectiveness of civil contempt orders and required de novo review by the district court, the rule may have
been unnecessarily restrictive in view of judicial decisions recognizing that bankruptcy judges have the power
to hold parties in civil contempt.
Subdivision (d), which provides that the rule shall not be construed to impair the right to trial by jury, is
deleted as unnecessary and is not intended to deprive any party of the right to a jury trial when it otherwise
exists.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made in the text of the proposed
amendments. Stylistic changes were made to the Committee Note.
Rule 9021. Entry of Judgment
A judgment or order is effective when entered under Rule 5003.
(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a). This rule is derived from Rule 58 F.R.Civ.P. The requirement that a judgment entered in an
adversary proceeding or contested matter be set forth on a separate document is to eliminate uncertainty as to
whether an opinion or memorandum of the court is a judgment. There is no sound reason to require that every
order in a case under the Code be evidenced by a separate document.
Subdivision (b) establishes a procedure for entering a judgment of a bankruptcy court for the recovery of
money or property in an index of judgments kept by the clerk of the district court. It clarifies the availability
of the same remedies for the enforcement of a bankruptcy court judgment as those provided for the
enforcement of a district court judgment. See 28 U.S.C. §§1961–63. When indexed in accordance with
subdivision (b) of this rule a judgment of the bankruptcy court may be found by anyone searching for liens of
[Release Point 118-106]
record in the judgment records of the district court. Certification of a copy of the judgment to the clerk of the
district court provides a basis for registration of the judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1963 in any other
district. When so registered, the judgment may be enforced by issuance of execution and orders for
supplementary proceedings that may be served anywhere within the state where the registering court sits. See
7 Moore, Federal Practice 2409–11 (2d ed. 1971). The procedures available in the district court are not
exclusive, however, and the holder of a judgment entered by the bankruptcy court may use the remedies under
Rules 7069 and 7070 even if the judgment is indexed by the clerk of the district court.
Subdivision (c) makes it clear that when a district court hears a matter reserved to it by 28 U.S.C. §§1471,
1481, its judgments are entered in the district court's civil docket and in the docket of the bankruptcy court.
When the district court acts as an appellate court, Rule 8016(a) governs the entry of judgments on appeal.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Former subdivision (a) was derived from Rule 58 F.R.Civ.P. As amended, Rule 9021 adopts Rule 58. The
reference in Rule 58 to Rule 79(a) F.R.Civ.P. is to be read as a reference to Rule 5003.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended in connection with the amendment that adds Rule 7058. The entry of judgment in
adversary proceedings is governed by Rule 7058, and the entry of a judgment or order in all other proceedings
is governed by this rule.
Changes Made After Publication. No changes since publication.
Rule 9022. Notice of Judgment or Order
(a) JUDGMENT OR ORDER OF BANKRUPTCY JUDGE. Immediately on the entry of a
judgment or order the clerk shall serve a notice of entry in the manner provided in Rule 5(b)
F.R.Civ.P. on the contesting parties and on other entities as the court directs. Unless the case is a
chapter 9 municipality case, the clerk shall forthwith transmit to the United States trustee a copy of
the judgment or order. Service of the notice shall be noted in the docket. Lack of notice of the entry
does not affect the time to appeal or relieve or authorize the court to relieve a party for failure to
appeal within the time allowed, except as permitted in Rule 8002.
(b) JUDGMENT OR ORDER OF DISTRICT JUDGE. Notice of a judgment or order entered by a
district judge is governed by Rule 77(d) F.R.Civ.P. Unless the case is a chapter 9 municipality case,
the clerk shall forthwith transmit to the United States trustee a copy of a judgment or order entered
by a district judge.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Subdivision (a) of this rule is an adaptation of Rule 77(d) F.R.Civ.P.
Subdivision (b) complements Rule 9021(b). When a district court acts as an appellate court, Rule 8016(b)
requires the clerk to give notice of the judgment on appeal.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to enable the United States trustee to be informed of all developments in the case so
that administrative and supervisory functions provided in 28 U.S.C. §586(a) may be performed.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2001 AMENDMENT
Rule 5(b) F.R.Civ.P., which is made applicable in adversary proceedings by Rule 7005, is being restyled
and amended to authorize service by electronic means—or any other means not otherwise authorized under
Rule 5(b)—if consent is obtained from the person served. The amendment to Rule 9022(a) authorizes the
clerk to serve notice of entry of a judgment or order by electronic means if the person served consents, or to
use any other means of service authorized under Rule 5(b), including service by mail. This amendment
conforms to the amendments made to Rule 77(d) F.R.Civ.P.

Rule 9023. New Trials; Amendment of Judgments
Except as provided in this rule and Rule 3008, Rule 59 F.R.Civ.P. applies in cases under the Code.
A motion for a new trial or to alter or amend a judgment shall be filed, and a court may on its own
order a new trial, no later than 14 days after entry of judgment. In some circumstances, Rule 8008
governs post-judgment motion practice after an appeal has been docketed and is pending.
(As amended Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009; Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Rule 59 F.R.Civ.P. regulates motions for a new trial and amendment of judgment. Those motions must be
served within 10 days of the entry of judgment. No similar time limit is contained in Rule 3008 which governs
reconsideration of claims.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to limit to 14 days the time for a party to file a post judgment motion for a new trial
and for the court to order sua sponte a new trial. In 2009, Rule 59 F. R. Civ. P. was amended to extend the
deadline for these actions to 28 days after the entry of judgment. That deadline corresponds to the 30-day
deadline for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case under Rule 4(a)(1)(A) F.R.App.P. In a bankruptcy case,
however, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal is 14 days. Therefore, the 28-day deadline for filing a
motion for a new trial or a motion to alter or amend a judgment would effectively override the notice of appeal
deadline under Rule 8002(a) but for this amendment.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to include a cross-reference to Rule 8008. That rule governs the issuance of an
indicative ruling when relief is sought that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been
docketed and is pending.

Rule 9024. Relief from Judgment or Order
Rule 60 F.R.Civ.P. applies in cases under the Code except that (1) a motion to reopen a case under
the Code or for the reconsideration of an order allowing or disallowing a claim against the estate
entered without a contest is not subject to the one year limitation prescribed in Rule 60(c), (2) a
complaint to revoke a discharge in a chapter 7 liquidation case may be filed only within the time
allowed by §727(e) of the Code, and (3) a complaint to revoke an order confirming a plan may be
filed only within the time allowed by §1144, §1230, or §1330. In some circumstances, Rule 8008
governs post-judgment motion practice after an appeal has been docketed and is pending.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Motions to reopen cases are governed by Rule 5010. Reconsideration of orders allowing and disallowing
claims is governed by Rule 3008. For the purpose of this rule all orders of the bankruptcy court are subject to
Rule 60 F.R.Civ.P.
Pursuant to §727(e) of the Code a complaint to revoke a discharge must be filed within one year of the
entry of the discharge or, when certain grounds of revocation are asserted, the later of one year after the entry
of the discharge or the date the case is closed. Under §1144 and §1330 of the Code a party must file a
complaint to revoke an order confirming a chapter 11 or 13 plan within 180 days of its entry. Clauses (2) and
(3) of this rule make it clear that the time periods established by §§727(e), 1144 and 1330 of the Code may not
be circumvented by the invocation of F.R.Civ.P. 60(b).
[Release Point 118-106]
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
Clause (3) is amended to include a reference to §1230 of the Code which contains time limitations relating
to revocation of confirmation of a chapter 12 plan. The time periods prescribed by §1230 may not be
circumvented by the invocation of F.R.Civ.P. 60(b).

The rule is amended to conform to the changes made to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure through the
restyling of those rules effective on December 1, 2007.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2014 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to include a cross-reference to Rule 8008. That rule governs the issuance of an

Rule 9025. Security: Proceedings Against Security Providers
Whenever the Code or these rules require or permit a party to give security, and security is given
with one or more security providers, each provider submits to the jurisdiction of the court, and
liability may be determined in an adversary proceeding governed by the rules in Part VII.
(As amended Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is an adaptation of Rule 65.1 F.R.Civ.P. and applies to any surety on a bond given pursuant to
§303(e) of the Code, Rules 2001, 2010, 5008, 7062, 7065, 8005, or any other rule authorizing the giving of
such security.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2018 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to reflect the amendment of Rule 62 F.R.Civ.P., which is made applicable to adversary
proceedings by Rule 7062. Rule 62 allows a party to obtain a stay of a judgment "by providing a bond or other
security." Limiting this rule's enforcement procedures to sureties might exclude use of those procedures
against a security provider that is not a surety. All security providers are brought into the rule by these
amendments.

Rule 9027. Removal
(a) NOTICE OF REMOVAL.
(1) Where Filed; Form and Content. A notice of removal shall be filed with the clerk for the
district and division within which is located the state or federal court where the civil action is
pending. The notice shall be signed pursuant to Rule 9011 and contain a short and plain statement
of the facts which entitle the party filing the notice to remove, contain a statement that upon
[Release Point 118-106]
removal of the claim or cause of action, the party filing the notice does or does not consent to
entry of final orders or judgment by the bankruptcy court, and be accompanied by a copy of all
process and pleadings.
(2) Time for Filing; Civil Action Initiated Before Commencement of the Case Under the Code.
If the claim or cause of action in a civil action is pending when a case under the Code is
commenced, a notice of removal may be filed only within the longest of (A) 90 days after the
order for relief in the case under the Code, (B) 30 days after entry of an order terminating a stay, if
the claim or cause of action in a civil action has been stayed under §362 of the Code, or (C) 30
days after a trustee qualifies in a chapter 11 reorganization case but not later than 180 days after
the order for relief.
(3) Time for filing; civil action initiated after commencement of the case under the Code. If a
claim or cause of action is asserted in another court after the commencement of a case under the
Code, a notice of removal may be filed with the clerk only within the shorter of (A) 30 days after
receipt, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim or
cause of action sought to be removed, or (B) 30 days after receipt of the summons if the initial
pleading has been filed with the court but not served with the summons.
(b) NOTICE. Promptly after filing the notice of removal, the party filing the notice shall serve a
copy of it on all parties to the removed claim or cause of action.
(c) FILING IN NON-BANKRUPTCY COURT. Promptly after filing the notice of removal, the
party filing the notice shall file a copy of it with the clerk of the court from which the claim or cause
of action is removed. Removal of the claim or cause of action is effected on such filing of a copy of
the notice of removal. The parties shall proceed no further in that court unless and until the claim or
cause of action is remanded.
(d) REMAND. A motion for remand of the removed claim or cause of action shall be governed by
Rule 9014 and served on the parties to the removed claim or cause of action.
(e) PROCEDURE AFTER REMOVAL.
(1) After removal of a claim or cause of action to a district court the district court or, if the case
under the Code has been referred to a bankruptcy judge of the district, the bankruptcy judge, may
issue all necessary orders and process to bring before it all proper parties whether served by
process issued by the court from which the claim or cause of action was removed or otherwise.
(2) The district court or, if the case under the Code has been referred to a bankruptcy judge of
the district, the bankruptcy judge, may require the party filing the notice of removal to file with the
clerk copies of all records and proceedings relating to the claim or cause of action in the court
from which the claim or cause of action was removed.
(3) Any party who has filed a pleading in connection with the removed claim or cause of action,
other than the party filing the notice of removal, shall file a statement that the party does or does
not consent to entry of final orders or judgment by the bankruptcy court. A statement required by
this paragraph shall be signed pursuant to Rule 9011 and shall be filed not later than 14 days after
the filing of the notice of removal. Any party who files a statement pursuant to this paragraph shall
mail a copy to every other party to the removed claim or cause of action.
(f) PROCESS AFTER REMOVAL. If one or more of the defendants has not been served with
process, the service has not been perfected prior to removal, or the process served proves to be
defective, such process or service may be completed or new process issued pursuant to Part VII of
these rules. This subdivision shall not deprive any defendant on whom process is served after
removal of the defendant's right to move to remand the case.
(g) APPLICABILITY OF PART VII. The rules of Part VII apply to a claim or cause of action
removed to a district court from a federal or state court and govern procedure after removal.
Repleading is not necessary unless the court so orders. In a removed action in which the defendant
has not answered, the defendant shall answer or present the other defenses or objections available
under the rules of Part VII within 21 days following the receipt through service or otherwise of a
copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief on which the action or proceeding is
[Release Point 118-106]
based, or within 21 days following the service of summons on such initial pleading, or within seven
days following the filing of the notice of removal, whichever period is longest.
(h) RECORD SUPPLIED. When a party is entitled to copies of the records and proceedings in any
civil action or proceeding in a federal or a state court, to be used in the removed civil action or
proceeding, and the clerk of the federal or state court, on demand accompanied by payment or tender
of the lawful fees, fails to deliver certified copies, the court may, on affidavit reciting the facts, direct
such record to be supplied by affidavit or otherwise. Thereupon the proceedings, trial and judgment
may be had in the court, and all process awarded, as if certified copies had been filed.
(i) ATTACHMENT OR SEQUESTRATION; SECURITIES. When a claim or cause of action is
removed to a district court, any attachment or sequestration of property in the court from which the
claim or cause of action was removed shall hold the property to answer the final judgment or decree
in the same manner as the property would have been held to answer final judgment or decree had it
been rendered by the court from which the claim or cause of action was removed. All bonds,
undertakings, or security given by either party to the claim or cause of action prior to its removal
shall remain valid and effectual notwithstanding such removal. All injunctions issued, orders entered
and other proceedings had prior to removal shall remain in full force and effect until dissolved or
modified by the court.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
Under 28 U.S.C. §1478(a) "any claim or cause of action in a civil action, other than a proceeding before the
United States Tax Court or a civil action by a Government unit to enforce [a] . . . regulatory or police power"
may be removed "if the bankruptcy courts have jurisdiction over such claim or cause of action." This rule
specifies how removal is accomplished, the procedure thereafter, and the procedure to request remand of the
removed claim or cause of action. If the claim or cause of action which is removed to the bankruptcy court is
subject to the automatic stay of §362 of the Code, the litigation may not proceed in the bankruptcy court until
relief from the stay is granted.
The subdivisions of this rule conform substantially to 28 U.S.C. §§1446–1450 and Rule 81(a) F.R.Civ.P.
pertaining to removal to the district courts.
Subdivision (a)(1) is derived from 28 U.S.C. §1446(a).
Subdivisions (a)(2) and (a)(3) are derived from paragraphs one and two of 28 U.S.C. §1446(b). Timely
exercise of the right to remove is as important in bankruptcy cases as in removals from a state court to a
district court.
Subdivision (a)(2) governs the situation in which there is litigation pending and a party to the litigation
becomes a debtor under the Code. Frequently, removal would be of little utility in such cases because the
pending litigation will be stayed by §362(a) on commencement of the case under the Code. As long as the stay
remains in effect there is no reason to impose a time limit for removal to the bankruptcy court and, therefore,
clause (B) of subdivision (a)(2) provides that a removal application may be filed within 30 days of entry of an
order terminating the stay. Parties to stayed litigation will not be required to act immediately on
commencement of a case under the Code to protect their right to remove. If the pending litigation is not stayed
by §362(a) of the Code, the removal application must ordinarily be filed within 90 days of the order for relief.
Clause (C) contains an alternative period for a chapter 11 case. If a trustee is appointed, the removal
application may be filed within 30 days of the trustee's qualification, provided that the removal application is
filed not more than 180 days after the order for relief.
The removal application must be filed within the longest of the three possible periods. For example, in a
chapter 11 case if the 90 day period expires but a trustee is appointed shortly thereafter, the removal
application may be filed within 30 days of the trustee's qualification but not later than 180 days after the order
for relief. Nevertheless, if the claim or cause of action in the civil action is stayed under §362, the application
may be filed after the 180 day period expires, provided the application is filed within 30 days of an order
terminating the stay.
Subdivision (a)(3) applies to the situation in which the case under the Code is pending when the removable
claim or cause of action is asserted in a civil action initiated in other than the bankruptcy court. The time for
filing the application for removal begins to run on receipt of the first pleading containing the removable claim
or cause of action. Only litigation not stayed by the Code or by court order may properly be initiated after the
case under the Code is commenced. See e.g., §362(a).
[Release Point 118-106]
Subdivision (b). With one exception, this subdivision is the same as 28 U.S.C. §1446(d). The exemption
from the bond requirement is enlarged to include a trustee or debtor in possession. Complete exemption from
the bond requirement for removal is appropriate because of the limited resources which may be available at
the beginning of a case and the small probability that an action will be improperly removed.
Recovery on the bond is permitted only when the removal was improper. If the removal is proper but the
bankruptcy court orders the action remanded on equitable grounds, 28 U.S.C. §1478(b), there is no recovery
on the bond.
Subdivisions (c) and (d) are patterned on 28 U.S.C. §1446(e).
Subdivision (e). There is no provision in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for seeking remand. The first
sentence of this subdivision requires that a request for remand be by motion and that the moving party serve
all other parties; however, no hearing is required. In recognition of the intrusion of the removal practice on the
state and federal courts from which claims or causes of action are removed, the subdivision directs the
bankruptcy court to decide remand motions as soon as practicable. The last sentence of this subdivision is
derived from 28 U.S.C. §1446(c)
Subdivisions (f) and (g), with appropriate changes to conform them to the bankruptcy context, are the same
as 28 U.S.C. §1447(a) and (b) and 28 U.S.C. §1448, respectively.
Subdivisions (h) and (i) are taken from Rule 81(c) F.R.Civ.P.
Subdivisions (j) and (k) are derived from 28 U.S.C. §1449 and §1450, respectively.
Remand orders of bankruptcy judges are not appealable. 28 U.S.C. §1478(b).
This rule does not deal with the question whether a single plaintiff or defendant may remove a claim or
cause of action if there are two or more plaintiffs or defendants. See 28 U.S.C. §1478.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Section 1452 of title 28, with certain exceptions, provides for removal of claims or causes of action in civil
actions pending in state or federal courts when the claim or cause of action is within the jurisdiction conferred
by 28 U.S.C. §1334. An order granting or denying a motion for remand is not appealable. 28 U.S.C. §1452(b).
Under subdivision (e), as amended, the district court must enter the order on the remand motion; however, the
bankruptcy judge conducts the initial hearing on the motion and files a report and recommendation. The
parties may file objections. Review of the report and recommendation is pursuant to Rule 9033.
Subdivision (f) has been amended to provide that if there has been a referral pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §157(a)
the bankruptcy judge will preside over the removed civil action.
Subdivision (i) has been abrogated consistent with the abrogation of Rule 9015.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
The abrogation of subdivision (b) is consistent with the repeal of 28 U.S.C. §1446(d). The changes
substituting the notice of removal for the application for removal conform to the 1988 amendments to 28
U.S.C. §1446.
Rules 7008(a) and 7012(b) were amended in 1987 to require parties to allege in pleadings whether a
proceeding is core or non-core and, if non-core, whether the parties consent to the entry of final orders or
judgment by the bankruptcy judge. Subdivision (a)(1) is amended and subdivision (f)(3) is added to require
parties to a removed claim or cause of action to make the same allegations. The party filing the notice of
removal must include the allegation in the notice and the other parties who have filed pleadings must respond
to the allegation in a separate statement filed within 10 days after removal. However, if a party to the removed
claim or cause of action has not filed a pleading prior to removal, there is no need to file a separate statement
under subdivision (f)(3) because the allegation must be included in the responsive pleading filed pursuant to
Rule 7012(b).
Subdivision (e), redesignated as subdivision (d), is amended to delete the restriction that limits the role of
the bankruptcy court to the filing of a report and recommendation for disposition of a motion for remand
under 28 U.S.C. §1452(b). This amendment is consistent with §309(c) of the Judicial Improvements Act of
1990, which amended §1452(b) so that it allows an appeal to the district court of a bankruptcy court's order
determining a motion for remand. This subdivision is also amended to clarify that the motion is a contested
matter governed by Rule 9014. The words "filed with the clerk" are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a)
and 9001(3).
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2002 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a)(3) is amended to clarify that if a claim or cause of action is initiated after the
commencement of a bankruptcy case, the time limits for filing a notice of removal of the claim or cause of
action apply whether the case is still pending or has been suspended, dismissed, or closed.
Changes Made After Publication and Comments. No changes were made.
[Release Point 118-106]
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the
manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a
deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following
manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods
• 25-day periods become 28-day periods
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2016 AMENDMENT
Subdivisions (a)(1) and (e)(3) are amended to delete the requirement for a statement that the proceeding is
core or non-core and to require in all removed actions a statement that the party does or does not consent to
the entry of final orders or judgment by the bankruptcy court. Some proceedings that satisfy the statutory
definition of core proceedings, 28 U.S.C. §157(b)(2), may remain beyond the constitutional power of a
bankruptcy judge to adjudicate finally. The amended rule calls for a statement regarding consent at the time of
removal, whether or not a proceeding is termed non-core.
The party filing the notice of removal must include a statement regarding consent in the notice, and the
other parties who have filed pleadings must respond in a separate statement filed within 14 days after removal.
If a party to the removed claim or cause of action has not filed a pleading prior to removal, however, there is
no need to file a separate statement under subdivision (e)(3), because a statement regarding consent must be
included in a responsive pleading filed pursuant to Rule 7012(b). Rule 7016 governs the bankruptcy court's
decision whether to hear and determine the proceeding, issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of
law, or take some other action in the proceeding.

F.R.Civ.P., to make and amend rules of practice and procedure which are consistent with—but not
[Release Point 118-106]
duplicative of—Acts of Congress and these rules and which do not prohibit or limit the use of the
Official Forms. Local rules shall conform to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the

(2) A local rule imposing a requirement of form shall not be enforced in a manner that causes a
party to lose rights because of a nonwillful failure to comply with the requirement.
(b) PROCEDURE WHEN THERE IS NO CONTROLLING LAW. A judge may regulate practice
in any manner consistent with federal law, these rules, Official Forms, and local rules of the district.
No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1983
This rule is an adaptation of Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P. and Rule 57(a) F.R.Crim.P. Under this rule bankruptcy
courts may make local rules which govern practice before those courts. Circuit councils and district courts are
authorized by Rule 8018 to make local rules governing appellate practice.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987 AMENDMENT
Rule 9029 is amended to authorize the district court to promulgate local rules governing bankruptcy
practice. This rule, as amended, permits the district court to authorize the bankruptcy judges to promulgate or
recommend local rules for adoption by the district court.
Effective August 1, 1985, Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P., governing adoption of local rules, was amended to achieve
greater participation by the bar, scholars, and the public in the rule making process; to authorize the judicial
council to abrogate local rules; and to make certain that single-judge standing orders are not inconsistent with
these rules or local rules. Rule 9029 has been amended to incorporate Rule 83. The term "court" in the last
sentence of the rule includes the judges of the district court and the bankruptcy judges of the district. Rule
9001(4).
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991 AMENDMENT
This rule is amended to make it clear that the Official Forms must be accepted in every bankruptcy court.
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1995 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (a). This rule is amended to reflect the requirement that local rules be consistent not only with
applicable national rules but also with Acts of Congress. The amendment also states that local rules should not
repeat applicable national rules and Acts of Congress.
The amendment also requires that the numbering of local rules conform with any uniform numbering
system that may be prescribed by the Judicial Conference. Lack of uniform numbering might create
unnecessary traps for counsel and litigants. A uniform numbering system would make it easier for an
increasingly national bar and for litigants to locate a local rule that applies to a particular procedural issue.
Paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) is new. Its aim is to protect against loss of rights in the enforcement of
local rules relating to matters of form. For example, a party should not be deprived of a right to a jury trial
because its attorney, unaware of—or forgetting—a local rule directing that jury demands be noted in the
caption of the case, includes a jury demand only in the body of the pleading. The proscription of paragraph (2)
is narrowly drawn—covering only violations that are not willful and only those involving local rules directed
to matters of form. It does not limit the court's power to impose substantive penalties upon a party if it or its
attorney stubbornly or repeatedly violates a local rule, even one involving merely a matter of form. Nor does it
affect the court's power to enforce local rules that involve more than mere matters of form—for example, a
local rule requiring that a party demand a jury trial within a specified time period to avoid waiver of the right
to a trial by jury.
Subdivision (b). This rule provides flexibility to the court in regulating practice when there is no controlling
law. Specifically, it permits the court to regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, with rules
adopted under 28 U.S.C. §2075, with Official Forms, and with the district's local rules.
This rule recognizes that courts rely on multiple directives to control practice. Some courts regulate practice
through the published Federal Rules and the local rules of the court. Some courts also have used internal
operating procedures, standing orders, and other internal directives. Although such directives continue to be
[Release Point 118-106]
authorized, they can lead to problems. Counsel or litigants may be unaware of various directives. In addition,
the sheer volume of directives may impose an unreasonable barrier. For example, it may be difficult to obtain
copies of the directives. Finally, counsel or litigants may be unfairly sanctioned for failing to comply with a
directive. For these reasons, the amendment to this rule disapproves imposing any sanction or other
disadvantage on a person for noncompliance with such an internal directive, unless the alleged violator has
been furnished in a particular case with actual notice of the requirement.
There should be no adverse consequence to a party or attorney for violating special requirements relating to
practice before a particular judge unless the party or attorney has actual notice of those requirements.
Furnishing litigants with a copy outlining the judge's practices—or attaching instructions to a notice setting a
case for conference or trial—would suffice to give actual notice, as would an order in a case specifically
adopting by reference a judge's standing order and indicating how copies can be obtained.

(a) SERVICE. In a proceeding in which the bankruptcy court has issued proposed findings of fact
and conclusions of law, the clerk shall serve forthwith copies on all parties by mail and note the date
of mailing on the docket.
(b) OBJECTIONS: TIME FOR FILING. Within 14 days after being served with a copy of the
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law a party may serve and file with the clerk written
objections which identify the specific proposed findings or conclusions objected to and state the
grounds for such objection. A party may respond to another party's objections within 14 days after
being served with a copy thereof. A party objecting to the bankruptcy judge's proposed findings or
conclusions shall arrange promptly for the transcription of the record, or such portions of it as all
parties may agree upon or the bankruptcy judge deems sufficient, unless the district judge otherwise
directs.
(c) EXTENSION OF TIME. The bankruptcy judge may for cause extend the time for filing
objections by any party for a period not to exceed 21 days from the expiration of the time otherwise
prescribed by this rule. A request to extend the time for filing objections must be made before the
time for filing objections has expired, except that a request made no more than 21 days after the
expiration of the time for filing objections may be granted upon a showing of excusable neglect.
(d) STANDARD OF REVIEW. The district judge shall make a de novo review upon the record
or, after additional evidence, of any portion of the bankruptcy judge's findings of fact or conclusions
of law to which specific written objection has been made in accordance with this rule. The district
judge may accept, reject, or modify the proposed findings of fact or conclusions of law, receive
further evidence, or recommit the matter to the bankruptcy judge with instructions.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1987
Section 157(c)(1) of title 28 requires a bankruptcy judge to submit proposed findings of fact and
conclusions of law to the district court when the bankruptcy judge has heard a non-core proceeding. This rule,
which is modeled on Rule 72 F.R.Civ.P., provides the procedure for objecting to, and for review by, the
district court of specific findings and conclusions.
Subdivision (a) requires the clerk to serve a copy of the proposed findings and conclusions on the parties.
The bankruptcy clerk, or the district court clerk if there is no bankruptcy clerk in the district, shall serve a
copy of the proposed findings and conclusions on all parties.
Subdivision (b) is derived from Rule 72(b) F.R.Civ.P. which governs objections to a recommended
disposition by a magistrate.
Subdivision (c) is similar to Rule 8002(c) of the Bankruptcy Rules and provides for granting of extensions
of time to file objections to proposed findings and conclusions.
Subdivision (d) adopts the de novo review provisions of Rule 72(b) F.R.Civ.P.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2009 AMENDMENT

manner:
• 5-day periods become 7-day periods
• 10-day periods become 14-day periods
• 15-day periods become 14-day periods
• 20-day periods become 21-day periods

beyond the constitutional power of a bankruptcy judge to adjudicate finally. If the bankruptcy court decides,
pursuant to Rule 7016, that it is appropriate to issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a
proceeding, this rule governs the subsequent procedures.
Rule 9034. Transmittal of Pleadings, Motion Papers, Objections, and Other
Papers to the United States Trustee
Unless the United States trustee requests otherwise or the case is a chapter 9 municipality case,
any entity that files a pleading, motion, objection, or similar paper relating to any of the following
matters shall transmit a copy thereof to the United States trustee within the time required by these
rules for service of the paper:
(a) a proposed use, sale, or lease of property of the estate other than in the ordinary course of
business;
(b) the approval of a compromise or settlement of a controversy;
(c) the dismissal or conversion of a case to another chapter;
(d) the employment of professional persons;
(e) an application for compensation or reimbursement of expenses;
(f) a motion for, or approval of an agreement relating to, the use of cash collateral or authority
to obtain credit;
(g) the appointment of a trustee or examiner in a chapter 11 reorganization case;
(h) the approval of a disclosure statement;
(i) the confirmation of a plan;
(j) an objection to, or waiver or revocation of, the debtor's discharge;
(k) any other matter in which the United States trustee requests copies of filed papers or the
court orders copies transmitted to the United States trustee.
(Added Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991
Section 307 of the Code gives the United States trustee the right to appear and be heard on issues in cases
and proceedings under the Code. This rule is intended to keep the United States trustee informed of certain
developments and disputes in which the United States trustee may wish to be heard. This rule, which derives
from Rule X–1008, also enables the United States trustee to monitor the progress of the case in accordance
with 28 U.S.C. §586(a). The requirement to transmit copies of certain pleadings, motion papers and other
documents is intended to be flexible in that the United States trustee in a particular judicial district may
request copies of papers in certain categories, and may request not to receive copies of documents in other
categories, when the practice in that district makes that desirable. When the rules require that a paper be
served on particular parties, the time period in which service is required is also applicable to transmittal to the
United States trustee.
Although other rules require that certain notices be transmitted to the United States trustee, this rule goes
further in that it requires the transmittal to the United States trustee of other papers filed in connection with
these matters. This rule is not an exhaustive list of the matters of which the United States trustee may be
entitled to receive notice.
Rule 9035. Applicability of Rules in Judicial Districts in Alabama and North
Carolina
In any case under the Code that is filed in or transferred to a district in the State of Alabama or the
State of North Carolina and in which a United States trustee is not authorized to act, these rules apply
to the extent that they are not inconsistent with any federal statute effective in the case.
(Added Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; amended Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997.)
NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1991
Section 302(d)(3) of the Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of
[Release Point 118-106]
1986 provides that amendments to the Code relating to United States trustees and quarterly fees required
under 28 U.S.C. §1930(a)(6) do not become effective in any judicial district in the States of Alabama and
North Carolina until the district elects to be included in the United States trustee system, or October 1, 1992,
whichever occurs first, unless Congress extends the deadline. If the United States trustee system becomes
effective in these districts, the transition provisions in the 1986 Act will govern the application of the United
States trustee amendments to cases that are pending at that time. See §302(d)(3)(F). The statute, and not the
bankruptcy court, determines whether a United States trustee is authorized to act in a particular case.
Section 302(d)(3)(I) of the 1986 Act authorizes the Judicial Conference of the United States to promulgate
regulations governing the appointment of bankruptcy administrators to supervise the administration of estates
and trustees in cases in the districts in Alabama and North Carolina until the provisions of the Act relating to
the United States trustee take effect in these districts. Pursuant to this authority, in September 1987, the
Judicial Conference promulgated regulations governing the selection and appointment of bankruptcy
administrators and regulations governing the establishment, duties, and functions of bankruptcy
administrators. Guidelines relating to the bankruptcy administrator program have been prescribed by the
Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
Many of these rules were amended to implement the United States trustee system in accordance with the
1986 Act. Since the provisions of the 1986 Act relating to the United States trustee system are not effective in
cases in Alabama and North Carolina in which a bankruptcy administrator is serving, rules referring to United
States trustees are at least partially inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and title 28 of the
United States Code effective in such cases.
In determining the applicability of these rules in cases in Alabama and North Carolina in which a United
States trustee is not authorized to act, the following guidelines should be followed:
(1) The following rules do not apply because they are inconsistent with the provisions of the Code or
title 28 in these cases: 1002(b), 1007(1), 1009(c), 2002(k), 2007.1(b), 2015(a)(6), 2020, 3015(b), 5005(b),
7004(b)(10), 9003(b), and 9034.
(2) The following rules are partially inconsistent with the provisions of the Code effective in these
cases and, therefore, are applicable with the following modifications:
(a) Rule 2001(a) and (c)—The court, rather than the United States trustee, appoints the interim
trustee.
(b) Rule 2003—The duties of the United States trustee relating to the meeting of creditors or
equity security holders are performed by the officer determined in accordance with regulations of the
Judicial Conference, guidelines of the Director of the Administrative Office, local rules or court orders.
(c) Rule 2007—The court, rather than the United States trustee, appoints committees in chapter 9
and chapter 11 cases.
(d) Rule 2008—The bankruptcy administrator, rather than the United States trustee, informs the
trustee of how to qualify.
(e) Rule 2009(c) and (d)—The court, rather than the United States trustee, appoints interim
trustees in chapter 7 cases and trustees in chapter 11, 12 and 13 cases.
(f) Rule 2010—The court, rather than the United States trustee, determines the amount and
sufficiency of the trustee's bond.
(g) Rule 5010—The court, rather than the United States trustee, appoints the trustee when a case
is reopened.
(3) All other rules are applicable because they are consistent with the provisions of the Code and title
28 effective in these cases, except that any reference to the United States trustee is not applicable and
should be disregarded.
Many of the amendments to the rules are designed to give the United States trustee, a member of the
Executive Branch, notice of certain developments and copies of petitions, schedules, pleadings, and other
papers. In contrast, the bankruptcy administrator is an officer in the Judicial Branch and matters relating to
notice of developments and access to documents filed in the clerk's office are governed by regulations of the
Judicial Conference of the United States, guidelines of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts,
local rules, and court orders. Also, requirements for disclosure of connections with the bankruptcy
administrator in applications for employment of professional persons, restrictions on appointments of relatives
of bankruptcy administrators, effects of erroneously filing papers with the bankruptcy administrator, and other
matters not covered by these rules may be governed by regulations of the Judicial Conference, guidelines of
the Director of the Administrative Office, local rules, and court orders.
This rule will cease to have effect if a United States trustee is authorized in every case in the districts in
Alabama and North Carolina.

[Release Point 118-106]
Certain statutes that are not codified in title 11 or title 28 of the United States Code, such as §105 of the
Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103–394, 108 Stat. 4106, relate to bankruptcy administrators in the
judicial districts of North Carolina and Alabama. This amendment makes it clear that the Bankruptcy Rules do
not apply to the extent that they are inconsistent with these federal statutes.
GAP Report on Rule 9035. No changes to the published draft.
Rule 9036. Notice and Service by Electronic Transmission
(a) IN GENERAL. This rule applies whenever these rules require or permit sending a notice or
serving a paper by mail or other means.
(b) NOTICES FROM AND SERVICE BY THE COURT.
(1) Registered Users. The clerk may send notice to or serve a registered user by filing the notice
or paper with the court's electronic-filing system.
(2) All Recipients. For any recipient, the clerk may send notice or serve a paper by electronic
means that the recipient consented to in writing, including by designating an electronic address for
receipt of notices. But these exceptions apply:
(A) if the recipient has registered an electronic address with the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts' bankruptcy-noticing program, the clerk shall send the notice to or serve
the paper at that address; and
(B) if an entity has been designated by the Director of the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts as a high-volume paper-notice recipient, the clerk may send the notice to
or serve the paper electronically at an address designated by the Director, unless the entity has
designated an address under §342(e) or (f) of the Code.
(c) NOTICES FROM AND SERVICE BY AN ENTITY. An entity may send notice or serve a
paper in the same manner that the clerk does under (b), excluding (b)(2)(A) and (B).
(d) COMPLETING NOTICE OR SERVICE. Electronic notice or service is complete upon filing
or sending but is not effective if the filer or sender receives notice that it did not reach the person to
be served. It is the recipient's responsibility to keep its electronic address current with the clerk.
(e) INAPPLICABILITY. This rule does not apply to any paper required to be served in
accordance with Rule 7004.

NOTES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RULES—1993
This rule is added to provide flexibility for banks, credit card companies, taxing authorities, and other
entities that ordinarily receive notices by mail in a large volume of bankruptcy cases, to arrange to receive by
electronic transmission all or part of the information required to be contained in such notices.
The use of electronic technology instead of mail to send information to creditors and interested parties will
be more convenient and less costly for the sender and the receiver. For example, a bank that receives by mail,
at different locations, notices of meetings of creditors pursuant to Rule 2002(a) in thousands of cases each
year may prefer to receive only the vital information ordinarily contained in such notices by electronic
transmission to one computer terminal.
The specific means of transmission must be compatible with technology available to the sender and the
receiver. Therefore, electronic transmission of notices is permitted only upon request of the entity entitled to
receive the notice, specifying the type of electronic transmission, and only if approved by the court.
Electronic transmission pursuant to this rule completes the notice requirements. The creditor or interested
party is not thereafter entitled to receive the relevant notice by mail.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2005 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to delete the requirement that the sender of an electronic notice must obtain electronic
confirmation that the notice was received. The amendment provides that notice is complete upon transmission.
When the rule was first promulgated, confirmation of receipt of electronic notices was commonplace. In the
[Release Point 118-106]
current electronic environment, very few internet service providers offer the confirmation of receipt service.
Consequently, compliance with the rule may be impossible, and the rule could discourage the use of electronic
noticing.
Confidence in the delivery of email text messages now rivals or exceeds confidence in the delivery of
printed materials. Therefore, there is no need for confirmation of receipt of electronic messages just as there is
no such requirement for paper notices.
Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes since publication.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2019 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to permit both notice and service by electronic means. The use and reliability of
electronic delivery have increased since the rule was first adopted. The amendments recognize the increased
utility of electronic delivery, with appropriate safeguards for parties not filing an appearance in the case
through the court's electronic-filing system.
The amended rule permits electronic notice or service on a registered user who has appeared in the case by
filing with the court's electronic-filing system. A court may choose to allow registration only with the court's
permission. But a party who registers will be subject to service by filing with the court's system unless the
court provides otherwise. The rule does not make the court responsible for notifying a person who filed a
paper with the court's electronic-filing system that an attempted transmission by the court's system failed. But
a filer who receives notice that the transmission failed is responsible for making effective service.
With the consent of the person served, electronic service also may be made by means that do not use the
court's system. Consent can be limited to service at a prescribed address or in a specified form, and it may be
limited by other conditions.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2021 AMENDMENT
The rule is amended to take account of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts' program for
providing notice to high-volume paper-notice recipients. Under this program, when the Bankruptcy Noticing
Center (BNC) has sent by mail more than a designated number of notices in a calendar month (initially set at
100) from bankruptcy courts to an entity, the Director of the Administrative Office will notify the entity that it
is a high-volume paper-notice recipient. As such, this "threshold notice" will inform the entity that it must
register an electronic address with the BNC. If, within a time specified in the threshold notice, a notified entity
enrolls in Electronic Bankruptcy Noticing with the BNC, it will be sent notices electronically at the address
maintained by the BNC upon a start date determined by the Director. If a notified entity does not timely enroll
in Electronic Bankruptcy Noticing, it will be informed that court-generated notices will be sent to an
electronic address designated by the Director. Any designation by the Director, however, is subject to the
entity's right under §342(e) and (f) of the Code to designate an address at which it wishes to receive notices in
chapter 7 and chapter 13 cases, including at its own electronic address that it registers with the BNC.
The rule is also reorganized to separate methods of electronic noticing and service available to courts from
those available to parties. Both courts and parties may serve or provide notice to registered users of the court's
electronic-filing system by filing documents with that system. Both courts and parties also may serve and
provide notice to any entity by electronic means consented to in writing by the recipient. Only courts may
serve or give notice to an entity at an electronic address registered with the BNC as part of the Electronic
Bankruptcy Noticing program.
The title of the rule is revised to more accurately reflect the rule's applicability to methods of electronic
noticing and service. Rule 9036 does not preclude noticing and service by physical means otherwise
authorized by the court or these rules.
Rule 9037. Privacy Protection For Filings Made with the Court
(a) REDACTED FILINGS. Unless the court orders otherwise, in an electronic or paper filing
made with the court that contains an individual's social-security number, taxpayer-identification
number, or birth date, the name of an individual, other than the debtor, known to be and identified as
a minor, or a financial-account number, a party or nonparty making the filing may include only:
(1) the last four digits of the social-security number and taxpayer-identification number;
(2) the year of the individual's birth;
(3) the minor's initials; and
(4) the last four digits of the financial-account number.
[Release Point 118-106]
(b) EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REDACTION REQUIREMENT. The redaction requirement
does not apply to the following:
(1) a financial-account number that identifies the property allegedly subject to forfeiture in a
forfeiture proceeding;
(2) the record of an administrative or agency proceeding unless filed with a proof of claim;
(3) the official record of a state-court proceeding;
(4) the record of a court or tribunal, if that record was not subject to the redaction requirement
when originally filed;
(5) a filing covered by subdivision (c) of this rule; and
(6) a filing that is subject to §110 of the Code.
(c) FILINGS MADE UNDER SEAL. The court may order that a filing be made under seal
without redaction. The court may later unseal the filing or order the entity that made the filing to file
a redacted version for the public record.
(d) PROTECTIVE ORDERS. For cause, the court may by order in a case under the Code:
(1) require redaction of additional information; or
(2) limit or prohibit a nonparty's remote electronic access to a document filed with the court.
(e) OPTION FOR ADDITIONAL UNREDACTED FILING UNDER SEAL. An entity making a
redacted filing may also file an unredacted copy under seal. The court must retain the unredacted
copy as part of the record.
(f) OPTION FOR FILING A REFERENCE LIST. A filing that contains redacted information may
be filed together with a reference list that identifies each item of redacted information and specifies
an appropriate identifier that uniquely corresponds to each item listed. The list must be filed under
seal and may be amended as of right. Any reference in the case to a listed identifier will be construed
to refer to the corresponding item of information.
(g) WAIVER OF PROTECTION OF IDENTIFIERS. An entity waives the protection of
subdivision (a) as to the entity's own information by filing it without redaction and not under seal.
(h) MOTION TO REDACT A PREVIOUSLY FILED DOCUMENT.
(1) Content of the Motion; Service. Unless the court orders otherwise, if an entity seeks to
redact from a previously filed document information that is protected under subdivision (a), the
entity must:
(A) file a motion to redact identifying the proposed redactions;
(B) attach to the motion the proposed redacted document;
(C) include in the motion the docket or proof-of-claim number of the previously filed
document; and
(D) serve the motion and attachment on the debtor, debtor's attorney, trustee (if any), United
States trustee, filer of the unredacted document, and any individual whose personal identifying
information is to be redacted.
(2) Restricting Public Access to the Unredacted Document; Docketing the Redacted Document.
The court must promptly restrict public access to the motion and the unredacted document
pending its ruling on the motion. If the court grants it, the court must docket the redacted
document. The restrictions on public access to the motion and unredacted document remain in
effect until a further court order. If the court denies it, the restrictions must be lifted, unless the
court orders otherwise.
(Added Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007; amended Apr. 25, 2019, eff. Dec. 1, 2019.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2007
The rule is adopted in compliance with section 205(c)(3) of the E-Government Act of 2002, Public Law No.
107–347. Section 205(c)(3) requires the Supreme Court to prescribe rules "to protect privacy and security
concerns relating to electronic filing of documents and the public availability . . . of documents filed
electronically." The rule goes further than the E-Government Act in regulating paper filings even when they
are not converted to electronic form, but the number of filings that remain in paper form is certain to diminish
[Release Point 118-106]
over time. Most districts scan paper filings into the electronic case file, where they become available to the
public in the same way as documents initially filed in electronic form. It is electronic availability, not the form
of the initial filing, that raises the privacy and security concerns addressed in the E-Government Act.
The rule is derived from and implements the policy adopted by the Judicial Conference in September 2001
to address the privacy concerns resulting from public access to electronic case files. See
http://www.privacy.uscourts.gov/Policy.htm. The Judicial Conference policy is that documents in case files
generally should be made available electronically to the same extent they are available at the courthouse,
provided that certain "personal data identifiers" are not included in the public file.
While providing for the public filing of some information, such as the last four digits of an account number,
the rule does not intend to establish a presumption that this information never could or should be protected.
For example, it may well be necessary in individual cases to prevent remote access by nonparties to any part
of an account number or social-security number. It may also be necessary to protect information not covered
by the redaction requirement—such as driver's license numbers and alien registration numbers—in a particular
case. In such cases, protection may be sought under subdivision (c) or (d). Moreover, the rule does not affect
the protection available under other rules, such as Rules 16 and 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
or under other sources of protective authority.
Any personal information not otherwise protected by sealing or redaction will be made available over the
internet. Counsel should therefore notify clients of this fact so that an informed decision may be made on what
information is to be included in a document filed with the court.
An individual debtor's full social-security number or taxpayer-identification number is included on the
notice of the §341 meeting of creditors sent to creditors. Of course, that is not filed with the court, see Rule
1007(f) (the debtor "submits" this information), and the copy of the notice that is filed with the court does not
include the full social-security number or taxpayer-identification number. Thus, since the full social-security
number or taxpayer-identification number is not filed with the court, it is not available to a person searching
that record.
The clerk is not required to review documents filed with the court for compliance with this rule. As
subdivision (a) recognizes, the responsibility to redact filings rests with counsel, parties, and others who make
filings with the court.
Subdivision (d) recognizes the court's inherent authority to issue a protective order to prevent remote access
to private or sensitive information and to require redaction of material in addition to that which would be
redacted under subdivision (a) of the rule. These orders may be issued whenever necessary either by the court
on its own motion, or on motion of a party in interest.
Subdivision (e) allows an entity that makes a redacted filing to file an unredacted document under seal. This
provision is derived from section 205(c)(3)(iv) of the E-Government Act. Subdivision (f) allows the option to
file a reference list of redacted information. This provision is derived from section 205(c)(3)(v) of the
E-Government Act, as amended in 2004.
In accordance with the E-Government Act, subdivision (f) of the rule refers to "redacted" information. The
term "redacted" is intended to govern a filing that is prepared with abbreviated identifiers in the first instance,
as well as a filing in which a personal identifier is edited after its preparation.
Subdivision (g) allows an entity to waive the protections of the rule as to that entity's own information by
filing it in unredacted form. An entity may elect to waive the protection if, for example, it is determined that
the costs of redaction outweigh the benefits to privacy. As to financial account numbers, the instructions to
Schedules E and F of Official Form 6 note that the debtor may elect to include the complete account number
on those schedules rather than limit the number to the final four digits. Including the complete number would
operate as a waiver by the debtor under subdivision (g) as to the full information that the debtor set out on
those schedules. The waiver operates only to the extent of the information that the entity filed without
redaction. If an entity files an unredacted identifier by mistake, it may seek relief from the court.
Trial exhibits are subject to the redaction requirements of Rule 9037 to the extent they are filed with the
court. Trial exhibits that are not initially filed with the court must be redacted in accordance with this rule if
and when they are filed as part of an appeal or for other reasons.
Changes After Publication. Rule 9037 is intended to parallel as closely as possible Civil Rule 5.2 and
Criminal Rule 49.1. The Advisory Committees have worked together to maintain as much consistency as
possible in the three versions of the rule. The rule has been revised to implement the several style revisions
suggested by the Style Subcommittee of the Standing Committee. Subdivision (b) was reorganized and
renumbered. Subdivisions (b)(1) and (b)(3) were added in response to suggestions by the Department of
Justice. Subdivision (b)(4), formerly subdivision (b)(2), was amended in response to the suggestion of the
Committee on Court Administration and Case Management so that the subdivision now refers to court records
that become a part of the record in the pending matter. The term "entity" has been substituted for "person" in
[Release Point 118-106]
subdivision (c) and for "party" in subdivisions (e) and (f) to conform the rule to the definitions provided in the
Bankruptcy Code.
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2019 AMENDMENT
Subdivision (h) is new. It prescribes a procedure for the belated redaction of documents that were filed
without complying with subdivision (a).
Generally, whenever someone discovers that information entitled to privacy protection under subdivision
(a) appears in a document on file with the court—regardless of whether the case in question remains open or
has been closed—that entity may file a motion to redact the document. A single motion may relate to more
than one unredacted document. The moving party may be, but is not limited to, the original filer of the
document. The motion must identify by location on the case docket or claims register each document to be
redacted. It should not, however, include the unredacted information itself.
Subsection (h)(1) authorizes the court to alter the prescribed procedure. This might be appropriate, for
example, when the movant seeks to redact a large number of documents. In that situation the court by order or
local rule might require the movant to file an omnibus motion, initiate a miscellaneous proceeding, or proceed
in another manner directed by the court.
Unless the court orders otherwise, the motion must identify the proposed redactions, and the moving party
must attach to the motion the proposed redacted document. The attached document must otherwise be
identical to the one previously filed. The court, however, may relieve the movant of this requirement in
appropriate circumstances, for example when the movant was not the filer of the unredacted document and
does not have access to it. Service of the motion and the attachment must be made on all of the following
individuals who are not the moving party: debtor, debtor's attorney, trustee, United States trustee, the filer of
the unredacted document, and any individual whose personal identifying information is to be redacted.
Because the filing of the motion to redact may call attention to the existence of the unredacted document as
maintained in the court's files or downloaded by third parties, courts should take immediate steps to protect
the motion and the document from public access. This restriction may be accomplished electronically,
simultaneous with the electronic filing of the motion to redact. For motions filed on paper, restriction should
occur at the same time that the motion is docketed so that no one receiving electronic notice of the filing of the
motion will be able to access the unredacted document in the court's files.
If the court grants the motion to redact, the court must docket the redacted document, and public access to
the motion and the unredacted document should remain restricted. If the court denies the motion, generally the
restriction on public access to the motion and the document should be lifted.
This procedure does not affect the availability of any remedies that an individual whose personal identifiers
are exposed may have against the entity that filed the unredacted document.
Rule 9038. Bankruptcy Rules Emergency
(a) CONDITIONS FOR AN EMERGENCY. The Judicial Conference of the United States may
declare a Bankruptcy Rules emergency if it determines that extraordinary circumstances relating to
public health or safety, or affecting physical or electronic access to a bankruptcy court, substantially
impair the court's ability to perform its functions in compliance with these rules.
(b) DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
(1) Content. The declaration must:
(A) designate the bankruptcy court or courts affected;
(B) state any restrictions on the authority granted in (c); and
(C) be limited to a stated period of no more than 90 days.
(2) Early Termination. The Judicial Conference may terminate a declaration for one or more
bankruptcy courts before the termination date.
(3) Additional Declarations. The Judicial Conference may issue additional declarations under
this rule.
(c) TOLLING AND EXTENDING TIME LIMITS.
(1) In an Entire District or Division. When an emergency is in effect for a bankruptcy court, the
chief bankruptcy judge may, for all cases and proceedings in the district or in a division:
(A) order the extension or tolling of a Bankruptcy Rule, local rule, or order that requires or
[Release Point 118-106]
allows a court, a clerk, a party in interest, or the United States trustee, by a specified deadline, to
commence a proceeding, file or send a document, hold or conclude a hearing, or take any other
action, despite any other Bankruptcy Rule, local rule, or order; or
(B) order that, when a Bankruptcy Rule, local rule, or order requires that an action be taken
"promptly," "forthwith," "immediately," or "without delay," it be taken as soon as is practicable
or by a date set by the court in a specific case or proceeding.
(2) In a Specific Case or Proceeding. When an emergency is in effect for a bankruptcy court, a
presiding judge may take the action described in (1) in a specific case or proceeding.
(3) When an Extension or Tolling Ends. A period extended or tolled under (1) or (2) terminates
on the later of:
(A) the last day of the time period as extended or tolled or 30 days after the emergency
declaration terminates, whichever is earlier; or
(B) the last day of the time period originally required, imposed, or allowed by the relevant
Bankruptcy Rule, local rule, or order that was extended or tolled.
(4) Further Extensions or Shortenings. A presiding judge may lengthen or shorten an extension
or tolling in a specific case or proceeding. The judge may do so only for good cause after notice
and a hearing and only on the judge's own motion or on motion of a party in interest or the United
States trustee.
(5) Exception. A time period imposed by statute may not be extended or tolled.
(Added Apr. 24, 2023, eff. Dec. 1, 2023.)
COMMITTEE NOTES ON RULES—2023
The rule is new. It provides authority to extend or toll the time limits in these rules during times of major
emergencies affecting the bankruptcy courts. The continuing operation of the bankruptcy courts during the
COVID–19 pandemic showed that the existing rules are flexible enough to accommodate remote proceedings,
service by mail, and electronic transmission of documents. Nevertheless, it appeared that greater flexibility
than Rule 9006(b) provides might be needed to allow the extension of certain time periods in specific cases or
any extension on a district-wide basis in response to an emergency.
Emergency rule provisions have also been added to the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate Rules. Along with
the Bankruptcy Rule, these rules have been made as uniform as possible. But each set of rules serves
distinctive purposes, shaped by different origins, traditions, functions, and needs. Different provisions were
compelled by these different purposes.
Subdivision (a) specifies the limited circumstances under which the authority conferred by this rule may be
exercised. The Judicial Conference of the United States has the exclusive authority to declare a Bankruptcy
Rules emergency, and it may do so only under extraordinary circumstances. Those circumstances must relate
to public health or safety or affect physical or electronic access to a bankruptcy court. And, importantly, the
court's ability to operate in compliance with the Bankruptcy Rules must be substantially impaired.
Under subdivision (b)(1), a Bankruptcy Rules emergency declaration must specify the bankruptcy courts to
which it applies because, instead of being nationwide, an emergency might be limited to one area of the
country or even to a particular state. The declaration must also specify a termination date that is no later than
90 days from the declaration's issuance. Under subdivisions (b)(2) and (b)(3), however, that time period may
be extended by the issuance of additional declarations or reduced by early termination if circumstances
change. The declaration must also specify any limitations placed on the authority granted in subdivision (c) to
modify time periods.
Subdivisions (c)(1) and (c)(2) grant the authority, during declared Bankruptcy Rules emergencies, to extend
or toll deadlines to the chief bankruptcy judge of a district on a district- or division-wide basis or to the
presiding judge in specific cases. Unless limited by the emergency declaration, this authority extends to all
time periods in the rules that are not also imposed by statute. It also applies to directives to take quick action,
such as rule provisions that require action to be taken "promptly," "forthwith," "immediately," or "without
delay."
Subdivision (c)(3), which addresses the termination of extensions and tolling, provides a "soft landing"
upon the termination of a Bankruptcy Rules emergency. It looks to three possible dates for a time period to
expire. An extended or tolled time period will terminate either 30 days after the rules-emergency declaration
terminates or when the original time period would have expired, whichever is later—unless the extension or
[Release Point 118-106]
tolling itself expires sooner than 30 days after the declaration's termination. In that case, the extended
expiration date will apply.
Subdivision (c)(4) allows fine tuning in individual cases of extensions of time or tollings that have been
granted.
Subdivision (c)(5) excepts from the authority to extend time periods any time provision imposed by statute.
The Bankruptcy Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. §2075, does not authorize the Bankruptcy Rules to supersede
conflicting laws. Accordingly, a time limit in a rule that is a restatement of a deadline imposed by statute or an
incorporation by reference of such a deadline may not be extended under this rule. However, if a statute
merely incorporates by reference a time period imposed by a rule, that period may be extended.
