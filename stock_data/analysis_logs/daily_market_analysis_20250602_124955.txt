    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in political discussions (Public Square, Congress), indicating potential policy shifts impacting markets. News channel activity suggests geopolitical risks are elevated. Executive orders are being issued, adding to uncertainty. Overall, the high message volume suggests increased volatility and risk aversion.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth (stagflation) creates a challenging environment. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the pressure. Market confidence is low, reflecting the economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to a risk-off environment. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles (e.g., Finance, Transportation) will likely underperform. Energy may be a relative outperformer due to geopolitical tensions. Long-term outlook is cautiously optimistic, assuming the Fed can eventually bring inflation under control.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (1.10) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to match the market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive (0.20) to account for the slightly elevated unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.35 to reflect the current economic headwinds."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. Geopolitical tensions and supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending may decline due to inflation.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and economic slowdown will hurt financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces cost pressures.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Economic slowdown and supply chain issues will negatively impact manufacturing.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Inflation and reduced consumer spending will hurt retail sales.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. High valuation and potential regulation create headwinds.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Economic slowdown will reduce demand for transportation services."
