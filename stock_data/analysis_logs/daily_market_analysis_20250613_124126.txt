Low market confidence and high unemployment further exacerbate the situation. The Fed's target inflation rate is far from being met, and the economy is contracting.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic data, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Investors are likely to remain cautious, and risk appetite will be low. Expect sector rotation towards defensive stocks.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, reflecting the poor market confidence. Momentum is slightly negative, reflecting the weak economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced, reflecting the increased uncertainty."
