    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture: high inflation, negative GDP growth, and low market confidence. Unemployment is slightly below the natural rate, which might contribute to wage-push inflation. The market is likely to be risk-averse and highly sensitive to any negative news.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment, the market is expected to be bearish in the short term. High inflation and negative growth will weigh on corporate earnings and investor sentiment. Defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples may outperform, while growth-oriented sectors like technology could face headwinds.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to significant inflation deviation. Market sentiment aligns with low market confidence. Momentum is slightly negative reflecting economic slowdown. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect current economic conditions."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and limited supply support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment will likely decrease due to inflation.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face increased regulatory scrutiny and potential loan losses due to economic slowdown.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Healthcare is a defensive sector and should hold up relatively well during economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Manufacturing faces mixed signals. Infrastructure spending could provide a boost, but overall demand may weaken.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decline due to inflation and recession fears.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies face valuation concerns and potential slowdown in growth.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation is sensitive to economic activity. Lower demand could offset any benefits from infrastructure spending."
