A BILL
To reinstate the construction of the Yucca Mountain Spent Fuel Repository, to provide a
long-term solution to the rising problem of the storage of high-level radioactive waste.
Be it enacted by the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress
Assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the “Yucca Mountain Spent Fuel Repository Reinstatement Act”
SECTION 2. FINDINGS.
It has been increasingly prevalent that:
A. A long-term solution regarding the storage of high-level radioactive waste is required
as soon as possible, for the following reasons;
i. The United States generates about 2000 metric tons of radioactive
waste every year,
ii. The United States has generated 83000 metric tons of waste since the
1950s,
iii. Current nuclear waste containment and storage techniques are
inefficient and are prone to breaches by nature,
iv. Most nuclear waste is currently stored on-site and in temporary holding
facilities, gravely increasing the chance of fallout in the event of a
natural disaster.
B. Yucca Mountain Spent Fuel Repository remains by far one of the most appropriate
and effective plans for a long-term spent fuel repository,
C. The total cut of funding for the Yucca Mountain Spent Fuel Repository via
amendment to the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations
Act, in 2011 severely hindered, if not blocked the progress pertaining to the Spent
Fuel Repository.

SECTION 3. REINSTATING & AWARDING NEW CONTRACTS
The United States of America will hereby reinstate the construction and operation of the
Yucca Mountain Spent Fuel Repository by awarding or renewing contracts to;
A. One primary contractor, formerly the URS Corporation (now part of AECOM)
B. Two principal subcontractors, formerly the Shaw Corporation and Areva Federal
Services LLC.
SECTION 4. ALLOCATION OF FUNDING
The newly reinstated Yucca Mountain Spent Fuel Repository will be allocated a budget of
$30,000,000,000 ($30 Billion), acquired by informing the United States Treasury to issue a
debt of the same amount.
SECTION 5.ENACTMENTDATE
This billwill be enactedoneyearafter its passing.
