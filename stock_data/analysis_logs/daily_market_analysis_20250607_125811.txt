    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political campaigns and news, indicating heightened awareness of external factors. The lack of discussion in the Executive channel suggests potential uncertainty or a wait-and-see approach from leadership. This contributes to a slightly negative sentiment.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth signals stagflation. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. The market is likely to react negatively to these conditions.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic climate, a bearish market outlook is warranted. High inflation and negative growth will likely pressure corporate earnings and investor sentiment. Expect increased volatility and a downward trend in the short term. Long-term recovery is uncertain.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment aligns with low market confidence. Momentum is reduced to reflect slowing economic activity. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect increased economic uncertainty."

    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative: Sensitive to economic cycles and likely to suffer from reduced demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative: Discretionary spending likely to decrease; staples may hold up better.",
    "TECH": "Negative: Facing headwinds from reduced corporate spending and consumer demand.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral: Mixed outlook; affected by both economic slowdown and potential infrastructure spending."
