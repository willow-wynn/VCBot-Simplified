    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress, suggesting potential legislative impacts on the market. Public Square activity is moderate, indicating a general awareness of market conditions. Executive activity is low, suggesting limited immediate policy changes. Overall, the discord activity suggests a slightly negative sentiment due to uncertainty.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a mixed picture. High inflation and negative GDP growth indicate stagflation. Low unemployment is a positive, but the overall economic environment is weak. The Fed's inability to meet its inflation target is a major concern. The market is likely to react negatively to these conditions.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and discord activity, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to decreased corporate earnings and investor confidence. Expect increased volatility and a downward trend in the short term. Long-term outlook remains uncertain, dependent on policy responses to inflation.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction: Set to -0.30 to reflect negative GDP growth. volatility: Set to 0.95 to reflect high inflation. market_sentiment: Aligned with market confidence at 0.35. momentum: Reduced to 0.25 due to weak economic growth. long_term_outlook: Slightly reduced to 0.41 to reflect increased uncertainty."

    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to high inflation and potential supply constraints.",

    "HEALTH": "Neutral outlook, relatively stable demand but faces cost pressures.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook due to economic slowdown and potential supply chain disruptions.",
    "RETAIL": "Slightly negative outlook due to inflation impacting consumer spending.",
    "TECH": "Negative outlook due to high valuation and potential for decreased growth.",
