A BILL
Toprotecta person’sability todeterminewhethertocontinueor endapregnancy,andto protect
ahealth careprovider’sability toprovideabortionservices.
Beit enactedby theSenateandHouseof Representativesofthe UnitedStatesof Americain
Congressassembled,
SECTION 1.SHORTTITLE.
This Actmaybe citedasthe“Women’s Health ProtectionActof 2022”.
SECTION 2.FINDINGSAND PURPOSE.
(a) Findings.—Congressfinds thefollowing:
(1) Abortion servicesareessential tohealthcareand accesstothose servicesis centralto
people’s abilityto participateequallyin theeconomicand sociallifeof theUnited States.
Abortion accessallowspeople who arepregnanttomake theirown decisionsabout their
pregnancies,their families, andtheirlives.
(2) Since1973,theSupremeCourtrepeatedlyhas recognized theconstitutionalright to terminate
apregnancybeforefetalviability, andtoterminate apregnancyafter fetalviability where itis
necessary,inthegood-faithmedical judgmentofthe treating healthcareprofessional,for the
preservationof thelife or healthof thepersonwho is pregnant.

(3) Nonetheless,accesstoabortion serviceshasbeen obstructedacross theUnited Statesin
various ways,includingblockades ofhealthcare facilitiesand associatedviolence,prohibitions
of, and restrictionson,insurance coverage;parental involvement laws(notification andconsent);
restrictionsthat shameandstigmatizepeople seekingabortionservices; andmedically
unnecessaryregulationsthat neitherconfer anyhealthbenefit norfurther the safetyof abortion
services,but whichharmpeoplebydelaying,complicatingaccess to,andreducing the
availability of, abortionservices.
(4) Reproductive justicerequires everyindividualtohave theright to maketheir owndecisions
abouthavingchildrenregardlessof theircircumstancesandwithout interferenceand
discrimination. ReproductiveJustice isahuman right that canandwill beachievedwhenall
people, regardlessof actualor perceivedrace, color,nationalorigin, immigration status,sex
(including genderidentity, sexstereotyping,or sexualorientation),age, ordisability statushave
theeconomic, social,and politicalpower andresourcestodefine andmake decisionsabout their
bodies, health,sexuality,families,and communitiesinall areasof theirlives,withdignity and
self-determination.
(5) Reproductive justiceseeks toaddress restrictionsonreproductivehealth,including abortion,
that perpetuatesystemsof oppression,lack of bodilyautonomy, whitesupremacy, andanti-Black
racism. Thisviolentlegacyhas manifestedinpolicies includingenslavement,rape,and
experimentation onBlackwomen; forcedsterilizations; medicalexperimentation onlow-income
women’s reproductivesystems; andthe forcibleremovalof Indigenouschildren.Accessto
equitablereproductive health care,includingabortionservices,has always beendeficientinthe
UnitedStatesfor Black, Indigenous,andotherPeople ofColor (BIPOC) andtheirfamilies.
(6) Thelegacyof restrictions onreproductivehealth,rights,andjustice isnot adated vestigeofa
dark history.Presently,the harmsofabortion-specific restrictionsfallespeciallyheavilyon
people withlowincomes,BIPOC,immigrants, youngpeople,people withdisabilities, andthose
living inrural and othermedically underservedareas.Abortion-specificrestrictionsareeven
morecompounded bytheongoing criminalizationofpeople who arepregnant,includingthose
who areincarcerated,living withHIV,orwith substance-usedisorders.These communities
alreadyexperiencehealthdisparitiesdueto social,political, andenvironmentalinequities, and
restrictionsonabortion servicesexacerbate theseharms.Removingmedically unjustified
restrictionsonabortion serviceswouldconstitute oneimportant step onthepath toward realizing
Reproductive Justicebyensuringthat thefull rangeof reproductivehealthcareis accessibleto
all whoneedit.
(7) Abortion-specific restrictionsarea toolof genderoppression,as theytargethealthcare
servicesthat areusedprimarily bywomen.Thesepaternalisticrestrictionsrelyonand reinforce
harmful stereotypesabout genderroles,women’s decision-making,andwomen’s need for

protection insteadof support, underminingtheirability tocontroltheirown livesandwell-being.
Theserestrictionsharmthebasicautonomy, dignity,andequality ofwomen,and theirabilityto
participatein thesocialand economiclifeof theNation.
(8) Theterms“woman” and “women”areused inthis bill toreflectthe identityofthe majority
of people targetedandaffectedbyrestrictionsonabortionservices,and toaddresssquarely the
targetedrestrictionsonabortion, whicharerootedinmisogyny. However,accessto abortion
servicesiscritical tothehealth ofeverypersoncapableof becomingpregnant.ThisAct is
intendedto protectallpeoplewith thecapacity for pregnancy—cisgenderwomen,transgender
men,non-binary individuals, thosewho identify withadifferentgender, andothers—whoare
unjustlyharmed byrestrictionsonabortion services.
(9) Since2011,Statesand localgovernments havepassednearly500restrictionssinglingout
healthcare providerswho offerabortion services,interferingwith theirabilitytoprovidethose
servicesand thepatients’abilitytoobtain those services.
(10) ManyState andlocal governmentshave imposedrestrictionsontheprovision ofabortion
servicesthat areneitherevidence-based norgenerally applicable tothe medicalprofessionor to
othermedically comparable outpatientgynecological procedures,such asendometrialablations,
dilation andcurettagefor reasonsotherthan abortion,hysteroscopies,loop electrosurgical
excision procedures,or other analogousnon-gynecologicalproceduresperformedin similar
outpatientsettingsincludingvasectomy,sigmoidoscopy, andcolonoscopy.
(11) Abortion isessentialhealthcare andoneof thesafest medicalproceduresin theUnited
States.An independent,comprehensivereviewof thestate ofscience onthesafety andqualityof
abortion services,publishedbythe NationalAcademiesof Sciences,Engineering,and Medicine
in 2018, found thatabortion inthe UnitedStatesis safeandeffectiveand thatthe biggestthreats
to the qualityof abortionservices intheUnited StatesareState regulationsthatcreate barriers to
care. Theseabortion-specific restrictionsconflictwith medicalstandards andarenotsupported
bytherecommendations and guidelinesissuedbyleadingreproductivehealthcare professional
organizationsincludingthe AmericanCollege ofObstetricians andGynecologists,the Society of
Family Planning, theNational Abortion Federation,the World HealthOrganization, andothers.
(12) Manyabortion-specificrestrictionsdonot conferanyhealthor safetybenefits onthe
patient. Instead,theserestrictions havethe purposeandeffect ofunduly burdeningpeople’s
personaland privatemedical decisionsto endtheirpregnanciesbymaking accessto abortion
servicesmoredifficult, invasive,and costly,oftenforcing people totravelsignificant distances
and makemultiple unnecessary visitstothe provider,andinsome cases,foreclosingthe option
altogether.Forexample, a 2018reportfromthe Universityof California SanFrancisco’s
AdvancingNew Standards inReproductiveHealth researchgroup foundthat in27cities across

theUnitedStates,people haveto travelmorethan 100milesinanydirection toreach anabortion
provider.
(13) An overwhelmingmajorityof abortionsinthe UnitedStatesareprovidedin clinics,not
hospitals,but thelargemajorityof countiesthroughout theUnited Stateshavenoclinics that
provideabortion.
(14) Theserestrictionsadditionallyharmpeople’s healthbyreducingaccessnot onlytoabortion
servicesbut alsoto otheressentialhealthcare servicesofferedbymany ofthe providers targeted
bytherestrictions,including—
(A) screeningsandpreventive services,includingcontraceptiveservices;
(B) testing andtreatment forsexually transmittedinfections;
(C) LGBTQ healthservices;and
(D) referralsfor primary care,intimate partner violenceprevention,prenatal careand adoption
services.
(15) Thecumulative effect ofthesenumerousrestrictionshas beento severelylimit the
availability of abortionservicesinsome areas, creatinga patchworksystemwhere accessto
abortion servicesismoreavailable insome Statesthaninothers. A2019report fromthe
Government AccountabilityOfficeexamining StateMedicaid compliance withabortion
coveragerequirements analyzed sevenkey challenges(identified bothbyhealthcareproviders
and researchliterature) andtheireffect onabortionaccess, andfound thataccess toabortion
servicesvaried acrosstheStatesand evenwithin aState.
(16) International humanrights lawrecognizesthat accesstoabortion isintrinsically linked to
therights tolife, health,equality andnon-discrimination,privacy,andfreedom from
ill-treatment. UnitedNations (UN)human rightstreaty monitoringbodies havefound that legal
abortion services,likeotherreproductivehealthcare services,mustbe available,accessible,
affordable, acceptable,and ofgoodquality. UNhuman rightstreaty bodieshave likewise
condemnedmedically unnecessary barriersto abortionservices,includingmandatorywaiting
periods, biasedcounseling requirements,and third-partyauthorizationrequirements.
(17) Core humanrightstreatiesratified bytheUnited Statesprotectaccess toabortion.For
example, in2018,theUN HumanRightsCommittee,which overseesimplementation ofthe
ICCPR, madeclearthat theright to life,enshrinedin Article6of theICCPR, ata minimum
requiresgovernments toprovidesafe,legal,and effectiveaccessto abortionwhere aperson’slife

and healthisatrisk,or when carrying apregnancytoterm wouldcausesubstantialpainor
suffering. TheCommitteestated thatgovernments must notimposerestrictionsonabortion
which subjectwomen andgirlsto physicalormental painor suffering, discriminateagainst
them, arbitrarily interferewith theirprivacy,or placethemat riskofundertaking unsafe
abortions.Furthermore, theCommittee statedthat governmentsshould removeexistingbarriers
that denyeffective accesstosafeand legalabortion,refrainfromintroducing newbarriersto
abortion, andprevent thestigmatizationof thoseseekingabortion.
(18) UNindependent humanrights expertshave expressedparticular concernabout barriersto
abortion servicesintheUnited States.Forexample,at theconclusionof his2017visitto the
UnitedStates,theUNSpecial Rapporteuronextreme povertyandhumanrights notedconcern
that low-incomewomenface legalandpracticalobstacles toexercisingtheir constitutionalright
to access abortionservices,trappingmany womenincycles ofpoverty. Similarly,in May2020,
theUNWorking Group ondiscrimination againstwomen andgirls,along withother human
rights experts,expressedconcern that somestates hadmanipulated theCOVID–19 crisisto
restrictaccessto abortion, whichtheexperts recognized as“the latestexample illustratinga
patternof restrictionsandretrogressions inaccessto legalabortioncareacross thecountry”and
remindedU.S. authoritiesthat abortioncare constitutesessentialhealthcarethat mustremain
available duringand after thepandemic.Theynoted that barrierstoabortion accessexacerbate
systemic inequalitiesand causeparticular harmtomarginalizedcommunities,including
low-incomepeople, peopleof color,immigrants,people withdisabilities, andLGBTQ people.
(19) Abortion-specific restrictionsaffect the costand availabilityofabortion services,andthe
settingsin whichabortionservicesaredelivered. People travelacross Statelinesand otherwise
engage ininterstatecommerce toaccessthis essentialmedical care,andmorewouldbeforced to
doso absentthisAct. Likewise,healthcareproviders travel acrossState linesandotherwise
engage ininterstatecommerce inordertoprovideabortion servicestopatients,and morewould
be forcedtodoso absentthisAct.
(20) Health careproviders engage inaformof economicandcommercial activitywhenthey
provideabortion services,and thereisan interstatemarket for abortionservices.
(21) Abortion restrictionssubstantiallyaffect interstatecommercein numerousways.For
example, toprovideabortion services,healthcareproviders engage ininterstatecommerceto
purchasemedicine,medical equipment,andothernecessarygoodsand services.Toprovideand
assistothers inproviding abortionservices,healthcare providersengage ininterstate commerce
to obtainand providetraining. Toprovideabortionservices,healthcareproviders employ and
obtain commercialservicesfrom doctors,nurses,andotherpersonnel who engagein interstate
commerceand travelacrossState lines.

(22) It isdifficult andtime andresource-consumingfor clinics tochallenge Statelaws that
burden or impedeabortion services.Litigationthat blocksone abortionrestriction maynot
prevent aState fromadoptingothersimilarly burdensomeabortionrestrictionsor usingdifferent
methodsto burdenor impede abortionservices.There isahistory andpatternof Statespassing
successiveand differentlawsthat undulyburden abortionservices.
(23) Whena healthcareprovider ceasesproviding abortionservicesas aresult ofburdensome
and medicallyunnecessaryregulations,it isoftendifficult or impossiblefor that healthcare
provider to recommenceproviding those abortionservices,anddifficult or impossible for other
healthcare providersto provideabortion servicesthatrestoreor replace theceasedabortion
services.
(24) Health careproviders aresubjecttolicense lawsin variousjurisdictions,which arenot
affectedbythis Actexceptas providedinthis Act.
(25) Congress hastheauthorityto enactthisAct toprotectabortion servicespursuantto—
(A) itspowers underthecommerce clauseofsection 8ofarticleI ofthe Constitutionofthe
UnitedStates;
(B) its powersunder section5of theFourteenthAmendmentto theConstitutionof theUnited
Statesto enforcetheprovisionsof section1ofthe FourteenthAmendment;and
(C) its powersunder thenecessaryand properclauseof section8ofArticle Iof theConstitution
of theUnitedStates.
(26) Congress hasusedits authorityinthe past toprotectaccess toabortionservicesand health
care providers’ability toprovideabortionservices.In theearly 1990s,protests andblockadesat
healthcare facilitieswhere abortionserviceswere provided,andassociatedviolence,increased
dramatically andreachedcrisislevel,requiring Congressional action.Congresspassedthe
Freedomof Accessto ClinicEntrances Act(Public Law 103–259;108Stat. 694)toaddress that
situationand protectphysical accesstoabortion services.
(27) Congressionalaction isnecessarytoput anendtoharmful restrictions,tofederally protect
accessto abortionservicesfor everyoneregardless ofwhere they live,and toprotectthe ability
of healthcare providersto providetheseservicesinasafe andaccessiblemanner.
(b) Purpose.—It isthepurpose ofthis Act—

(1) to permit healthcareproviders toprovideabortionserviceswithout limitationsor
requirements thatsingleout theprovision ofabortionservicesfor restrictionsthat aremore
burdensomethanthose restrictions imposedonmedically comparableprocedures,donot
significantlyadvancereproductive healthorthe safetyof abortionservices,andmake abortion
servicesmoredifficult to access;
(2) to promoteaccessto abortion servicesandwomen’s abilitytoparticipate equallyinthe
economic andsocial lifeof theUnited States;and
(3) to invokeCongressionalauthority, includingthepowers ofCongress under thecommerce
clause of section8of article Iof theConstitutionof theUnited States,itspowers under section5
of theFourteenth Amendmentto theConstitutionof theUnited Statestoenforce theprovisions
of section 1of theFourteenthAmendment,andits powers under thenecessaryandproper clause
