However, potential policy changes from the government could offer some upside in the long term, depending on their effectiveness.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, aligning with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting some hope for future growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced due to the current economic conditions."
