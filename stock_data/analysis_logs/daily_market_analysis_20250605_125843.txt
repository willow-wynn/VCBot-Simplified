    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high political discussion, suggesting uncertainty.

    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. The unemployment rate is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. The market confidence is low, reflecting the overall economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to continued market volatility. Political uncertainty adds another layer of risk. Expect downward pressure on stock prices, with potential for short-term rallies followed by further declines. Defensive sectors may outperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, reflecting the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting some underlying economic activity. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic concerns."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. Energy sector benefits from inflation and potential supply constraints. Expect increased volatility but overall positive returns.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Entertainment sector is vulnerable to economic downturns as consumer spending decreases. Expect downward pressure on stock prices.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Financial sector is negatively impacted by high inflation and potential interest rate hikes. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare sector is relatively defensive but still susceptible to broader market trends. Expect moderate performance.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing sector is negatively impacted by economic slowdown and potential trade disruptions. Expect downward pressure.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Retail sector is vulnerable to decreased consumer spending due to inflation. Expect downward pressure, especially for discretionary items.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech sector is sensitive to interest rate hikes and economic slowdown. Expect increased volatility and potential downward pressure.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation sector is affected by both economic activity and energy prices. Expect moderate performance with increased volatility."
