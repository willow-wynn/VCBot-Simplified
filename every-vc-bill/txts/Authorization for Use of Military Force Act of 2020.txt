IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES
APRIL 17, 2020
Mr. EMPERIO (for himself, Mr. HERSEY, Mr. ROSS, Mr. SANDOVAL, Mr. SONN) introduced
the following bill;
JOINT RESOLUTION
To update the Authorization for Use of Military Force for operations against the Taliban, al Qaeda, the
Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and other designated associated forces, along with providing a
transparent and sustainable statutory basis for counter-terrorism operations.
Whereas, ever since the enactment of the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107–40;
50 U.S.C. 1541 note), in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, the nature of armed conflict has
expanded to encompass multiple non-state terrorist organizations, such as al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the Islamic
State of Iraq and Syria, and other designated associated forces, that pose a grave danger to the security of the
United States.
Whereas, it is appropriate for Congress to affirm the legal basis for the use of military force and the
waging of conflict overseas, and to reassert the role of Congress for conducting oversight for the military forces.
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; ETC.

pursuant to this authorization and is engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition
