    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress, indicating concerns about the economy and environment. Public Square discussions suggest some skepticism and calls for change. Executive office activity is present, but limited. Overall, the tone is cautious and slightly negative, reflecting economic anxieties.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%), coupled with negative GDP growth (-1.2%) and a slightly elevated unemployment rate (4.2%), signals stagflation. Market confidence is low at 35%. This environment warrants a bearish outlook.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment, the market is expected to be volatile and trend downwards. Sectors sensitive to economic downturns, such as entertainment and finance, will likely underperform. Energy may see some support due to inflation. Defensive sectors like health care and consumer staples may hold up relatively better. Overall, a cautious approach is advised.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (1.15) due to the significant inflation deviation. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence (0.35). Momentum is slightly positive (0.20) due to the slightly elevated unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly decreased to 0.35 to reflect the current economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector may see some support due to inflationary pressures, but overall demand could be impacted by the economic slowdown. Expect moderate performance.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector is expected to underperform due to reduced consumer spending during the economic downturn. Discretionary spending will be down.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector will likely face challenges due to potential interest rate hikes and reduced lending activity. Expect underperformance.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector is expected to be relatively stable as it is a defensive sector. Demand for healthcare services remains consistent regardless of economic conditions. Expect outperformance.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector will be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown and reduced business investment. Expect underperformance.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector will face mixed results. Consumer staples may hold up better, while discretionary retail will likely suffer. Expect neutral performance.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector is expected to be volatile. Some companies may be resilient, but overall growth prospects are diminished. Expect neutral performance.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector will be negatively impacted by reduced economic activity and trade. Expect underperformance."
