    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress and Public Square, indicating interest in legislative and general market discussions. Executive and State activity is low, suggesting less immediate impact from those branches. The McGavin campaign ad may have a slight positive impact on sentiment, but overall, the discord activity is neutral.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) necessitates a high volatility parameter. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) warrants a negative trend direction. Low market confidence (35%) justifies a low market sentiment parameter. Low unemployment (3.2%) provides some positive momentum, but is overshadowed by the other negative indicators.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to high inflation and negative GDP growth. Increased volatility is expected. Long-term outlook remains uncertain, but slightly pessimistic. Sector rotation is expected to favor defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect negative GDP growth and overall economic momentum. Volatility is set to 1.15 to reflect the high inflation rate. Market sentiment is set to 0.35 to align with the low market confidence. Momentum is set to 0.25 to reflect the slightly positive impact of low unemployment. Long-term outlook is adjusted slightly to 0.41 to reflect the uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to persistent inflation and potential supply constraints.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook due to economic downturn and reduced consumer spending.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to slightly negative outlook due to interest rate uncertainty and potential for loan defaults.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive outlook as a defensive sector, less sensitive to economic cycles.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook due to reduced demand and supply chain disruptions.",
    "RETAIL": "Mixed outlook. Consumer staples (WMT, COST) will perform better than discretionary retail.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to slightly negative outlook. High growth tech may suffer, while established tech may hold steady.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative outlook due to reduced economic activity and trade."
