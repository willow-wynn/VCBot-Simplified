IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
MARCH 16, 2024
Introduced by Sen. Pluribus (On behalf of the Charest administration)
A JOINT RESOLUTION
To authorize the use of United States Armed Forces in support of Operation
Resolute Democracy, Haiti.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled,
WHEREAS, the security situation over the past few years since the assassination of
Haitian President Jovenel Mosie in Haiti has evolved into Haiti becoming a failed state,
creating a dire humanitarian crisis;
WHEREAS, the instability in Haiti over the last few months has culminated in the recent
assassination of Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry, and an increase in gang violence
following that incident and recent prison breaks;
WHEREAS, the United States has been called upon by regional partners in the Caribbean,
specifically at the behest of the Caribbean Community, or CARICOM, to lead a response to
the dire security situation in the Republic of Haiti;
WHEREAS, in conjunction with international and regional partners, Operation Resolute
Democracy has been introduced with the goals of bringing immediate security, facilitate
democratic transition, and help Haiti rebuild economically;
WHEREAS, a failed and or mafia state off the coast of the United States presents a threat
not just to the United States’ national security, but to the Caribbean region as a whole.
