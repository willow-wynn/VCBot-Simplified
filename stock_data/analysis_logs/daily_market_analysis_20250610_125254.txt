  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows low engagement in Congress and News channels, suggesting a lack of immediate catalysts. The Public Square activity is largely non-directional, indicating general market uncertainty. Executive channel activity is minimal, reflecting a lack of strong leadership signals.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target (2.0%), while GDP growth is negative (-1.2%). Unemployment is low (3.2%), but this is within the range of the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), suggesting limited further improvement. The combination of high inflation and negative growth points to stagflation. Market confidence is very low at 35%.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment and low market confidence, a bearish short-term outlook is warranted. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic growth, such as Finance and Consumer Discretionary, are likely to underperform. Defensive sectors, such as Healthcare and Consumer Staples, may offer some relative protection. Energy sector is expected to be resilient due to inflation.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (1.15) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to match the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive (0.25) due to the low unemployment rate, but is dampened by the overall economic weakness. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.41 to reflect the increased uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector is expected to be resilient due to high inflation and potential supply constraints. Oil and gas companies (XOM, CVX, COP) are likely to maintain strong performance.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector (DIS, NFLX, EA) faces headwinds due to consumer spending concerns. Expect underperformance as consumers cut back on discretionary expenses.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector (JPM, BAC, GS, V) is vulnerable to economic slowdown and potential interest rate hikes. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector (JNJ, UNH, PFE) is considered a defensive sector and may offer some relative protection during economic downturns. Demand for healthcare services remains relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector (CAT, GE, LMT) is sensitive to economic growth and faces challenges from supply chain disruptions and rising input costs. Expect moderate underperformance.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector (WMT, COST, HD) faces mixed prospects. Discount retailers (WMT, COST) may benefit from consumers seeking value, while home improvement (HD) may see reduced demand.",
    "TECH": "Technology sector (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA) faces headwinds from slowing economic growth and potential regulatory scrutiny. Expect increased volatility and selective investment opportunities.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector (BA) is highly sensitive to economic cycles. Expect underperformance due to decreased travel and freight activity."
