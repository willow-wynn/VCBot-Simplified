    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low, reflecting the overall economic uncertainty. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major concern.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the current economic climate, a bearish market outlook is warranted. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely put downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles, such as finance and consumer discretionary, are expected to underperform. Defensive sectors like healthcare and energy may offer some stability. Expect increased volatility and risk aversion.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting some underlying economic activity and employment trends. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced, reflecting the increased uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive: High inflation and supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative: Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment is likely to decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative: Rising interest rates and economic slowdown will negatively impact the financial sector.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive: Healthcare is a defensive sector and less sensitive to economic cycles.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral: Manufacturing faces mixed signals with some demand but also supply chain issues and rising costs.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative: Retail sales are expected to decline as consumers cut back on discretionary spending.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative: Tech sector faces headwinds from rising interest rates and potential slowdown in business investment.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral: Transportation sector is impacted by both economic slowdown and potential infrastructure spending."
