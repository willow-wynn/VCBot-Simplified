BATTERED IMMIGRANT WOMEN; FINDINGS AND PURPOSES
Pub. L. 106–386, div. B, title V, §1502, Oct. 28, 2000, 114 Stat. 1518, provided that:
"(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
"(1) the goal of the immigration protections for battered immigrants included in the Violence Against
Women Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103–322, title IV, see Tables for classification] was to remove immigration
laws as a barrier that kept battered immigrant women and children locked in abusive relationships;
"(2) providing battered immigrant women and children who were experiencing domestic violence at
home with protection against deportation allows them to obtain protection orders against their abusers and
frees them to cooperate with law enforcement and prosecutors in criminal cases brought against their
abusers and the abusers of their children without fearing that the abuser will retaliate by withdrawing or
threatening withdrawal of access to an immigration benefit under the abuser's control; and
"(3) there are several groups of battered immigrant women and children who do not have access to the
immigration protections of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 which means that their abusers are
virtually immune from prosecution because their victims can be deported as a result of action by their
abusers and the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot offer them protection no matter how
compelling their case under existing law.
"(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 2000 Amendments note above] are—
"(1) to remove barriers to criminal prosecutions of persons who commit acts of battery or extreme
cruelty against immigrant women and children; and
"(2) to offer protection against domestic violence occurring in family and intimate relationships that
are covered in State and tribal protection orders, domestic violence, and family law statutes."
PROTECTION FOR CERTAIN CRIME VICTIMS INCLUDING VICTIMS OF CRIMES AGAINST
WOMEN
Pub. L. 106–386, div. B, title V, §1513(a), Oct. 28, 2000, 114 Stat. 1533, provided that:
"(a) FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.—
"(1) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following findings:
"(A) Immigrant women and children are often targeted to be victims of crimes committed against
them in the United States, including rape, torture, kidnaping, trafficking, incest, domestic violence,
sexual assault, female genital mutilation, forced prostitution, involuntary servitude, being held hostage or
being criminally restrained.
"(B) All women and children who are victims of these crimes committed against them in the
United States must be able to report these crimes to law enforcement and fully participate in the
investigation of the crimes committed against them and the prosecution of the perpetrators of such
crimes.
"(2) PURPOSE.—
"(A) The purpose of this section [amending this section and sections 1182, 1184, 1255, and 1367
of this title] is to create a new nonimmigrant visa classification that will strengthen the ability of law
enforcement agencies to detect, investigate, and prosecute cases of domestic violence, sexual assault,
trafficking of aliens, and other crimes described in section 101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of the Immigration and
[Release Point 118-106]
Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii)] committed against aliens, while offering protection to
victims of such offenses in keeping with the humanitarian interests of the United States. This visa will
encourage law enforcement officials to better serve immigrant crime victims and to prosecute crimes
committed against aliens.
"(B) Creating a new nonimmigrant visa classification will facilitate the reporting of crimes to law
enforcement officials by trafficked, exploited, victimized, and abused aliens who are not in lawful
immigration status. It also gives law enforcement officials a means to regularize the status of cooperating
individuals during investigations or prosecutions. Providing temporary legal status to aliens who have
been severely victimized by criminal activity also comports with the humanitarian interests of the United
States.
"(C) Finally, this section gives the Attorney General discretion to convert the status of such
nonimmigrants to that of permanent residents when doing so is justified on humanitarian grounds, for
family unity, or is otherwise in the public interest."

Justice for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Attorney General shall provide for improved
immigration and naturalization services and for enhanced community outreach and in-service training of
personnel of the Service. Such enhanced community outreach may include the establishment of appropriate
local community taskforces to improve the working relationship between the Service and local community
groups and organizations (including employers and organizations representing minorities).
"(d) SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR WAGE AND HOUR
ENFORCEMENT.—There are authorized to be appropriated, in addition to such sums as may be available for
such purposes, such sums as may be necessary to the Department of Labor for enforcement activities of the
Wage and Hour Division and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs within the Employment
Standards Administration of the Department in order to deter the employment of unauthorized aliens and
remove the economic incentive for employers to exploit and use such aliens."

DETERRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
Memorandum of President of the United States, Feb. 7, 1995, 60 F.R. 7885, provided:
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
It is a fundamental right and duty for a nation to protect the integrity of its borders and its laws. This
Administration shall stand firm against illegal immigration and the continued abuse of our immigration laws.
By closing the back door to illegal immigration, we will continue to open the front door to legal immigrants.
My Administration has moved swiftly to reverse the course of a decade of failed immigration policies. Our
initiatives have included increasing overall Border personnel by over 50 percent since 1993. We also are
strengthening worksite enforcement and work authorization verification to deter employment of illegal aliens.
Asylum rules have been reformed to end abuse by those falsely claiming asylum, while offering protection to
those in genuine fear of persecution. We are cracking down on smugglers of illegal aliens and reforming
criminal alien deportation for quicker removal. And we are the first Administration to obtain funding to
reimburse States for a share of the costs of incarcerating criminal illegal aliens.
While we already are doing more to stem the flow of illegal immigration than has any previous
Administration, more remains to be done. In conjunction with the Administration's unprecedented budget
proposal to support immigration initiatives, this directive provides a blueprint of policies and priorities for this
Administration's continuing work to curtail illegal immigration. With its focus on strong border deterrence
backed up by effective worksite enforcement, removal of criminal and other deportable aliens and assistance
to states, this program protects the security of our borders, our jobs and our communities for all
Americans—citizens and legal immigrants alike.
COMPREHENSIVE BORDER CONTROL STRATEGY
A. DETERRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AT OUR BORDERS
I have directed the Attorney General to move expeditiously toward full implementation of our
comprehensive border control strategy, including efforts at the southwest border. To support sustained
long-term strengthening of our deterrence capacity, the Administration shall seek funding to add new Border
Patrol agents to reach the goal of at least 7,000 agents protecting our borders by the year 2000.
FLEXIBLE BORDER RESPONSE CAPACITY
To further this strategy, the Department of Justice shall implement the capacity to respond to emerging
situations anywhere along our national borders to deter buildups of illegal border crossers, smuggling
operations, or other developing problems.
STRATEGIC USE OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY
Through the strategic use of sensors, night scopes, helicopters, light planes, all-terrain vehicles,
fingerprinting and automated recordkeeping, we have freed many Border Patrol agents from long hours of
bureaucratic tasks and increased the effectiveness of these highly-trained personnel. Because these tools are
essential for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to do its job, I direct the Attorney General to
accelerate to the greatest extent possible their utilization and enhancement to support implementation of our
deterrence strategy.
STRONG ENFORCEMENT AGAINST REPEAT ILLEGAL CROSSERS
The Department of Justice shall assess the effectiveness of efforts underway to deter repeat illegal crossers,
such as fingerprinting and dedicating prosecution resources to enforce the new prosecution authority provided
by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103–322, see Tables for
classification].
The Department of Justice shall determine whether accelerated expansion of these techniques to additional
border sectors is warranted.
B. DETERRING ALIEN SMUGGLING
[Release Point 118-106]
This Administration has had success deterring large ship-based smuggling directly to United States shores.
In response, smugglers are testing new routes and tactics. Our goal: similar success in choking off these
attempts by adjusting our anti-smuggling initiatives to anticipate shifting smuggling patterns.
To meet new and continuing challenges posed along transport routes and in foreign locations by smuggling
organizations, we will augment diplomatic and enforcement resources at overseas locations to work with host
governments, and increase related intelligence gathering efforts.
The Departments of State and Justice, in cooperation with other relevant agencies, will report to the
National Security Council within 30 days on the structure of interagency coordination to achieve these
objectives.
Congressional action will be important to provide U.S. law enforcement agencies with needed authority to
deal with international smuggling operations. I will propose that the Congress pass legislation providing
wiretap authority for investigation of alien smuggling cases and providing authorization to seize the assets of
groups engaged in trafficking in human cargo.
In addition, I will propose legislation to give the Attorney General authority to implement procedures for
expedited exclusion to deal with large flows of undocumented migrants, smuggling operations, and other
extraordinary migration situations.
C. VISA OVERSTAY DETERRENCE
Nearly half of this country's illegal immigrants come into the country legally and then stay after they are
required by law to depart, often using fraudulent documentation. No Administration has ever made a serious
effort to identify and deport these individuals. This Administration is committed to curtailing this form of
illegal immigration.
Therefore, relevant departments and agencies are directed to review their policies and practices to identify
necessary reforms to curtail visa overstayers and to enhance investigations and prosecution of those who
fraudulently produce or misuse passports, visas, and other travel related documents. Recommendations for
administrative initiatives and legislative reform shall be presented to the White House Interagency Working
Group on Immigration by June 30, 1995.
REDUCING THE MAGNET OF WORK OPPORTUNITIES, WORKSITE ENFORCEMENT,
AND DETERRENCE
Border deterrence cannot succeed if the lure of jobs in the United States remains. Therefore, a second major
component of the Administration's deterrence strategy is to toughen worksite enforcement and employer
sanctions. Employers who hire illegal immigrants not only obtain unfair competitive advantage over
law-abiding employers, their unlawful use of illegal immigrants suppresses wages and working conditions for
our country's legal workers. Our strategy, which targets enforcement efforts at employers and industries that
historically have relied upon employment of illegal immigrants, will not only strengthen deterrence of illegal
immigration, but better protect American workers and businesses that do not hire illegal immigrants.
Central to this effort is an effective, nondiscriminatory means of verifying the employment authorization of
all new employees. The Administration fully supports the recommendation of the Commission on Legal
Immigration Reform to create pilot projects to test various techniques for improving workplace verification,
including a computer database test to validate a new worker's social security number for work authorization
purposes. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and Social Security Administration are directed
to establish, implement, monitor, and review the pilots and provide me with an interim report on the progress
of this program by March 1, 1996.
In addition, the INS is directed to finalize the Administration's reduction of the number of authorized
documents to support work verification for noncitizens. Concurrently, the Administration will seek further
reduction legislatively in the number of documents that are acceptable for proving identity and work
authorization. The Administration will improve the security of existing documents to be used for work
authorization and seek increased penalties for immigration fraud, including fraudulent production and use of
documents.
The Department of Labor shall intensify its investigations in industries with patterns of labor law violations
that promote illegal immigration.
I also direct the Department of Labor, INS, and other relevant Federal agencies to expand their
collaboration in cracking down on those who subvert fair competition by hiring illegal aliens. This may
include increased Federal authority to confiscate assets that are the fruits of that unfair competition.
The White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration shall further examine the link between
immigration and employment, including illegal immigration, and recommend to me other appropriate
measures.
[Release Point 118-106]
DETENTION AND REMOVAL OF DEPORTABLE ILLEGAL ALIENS
The Administration's deterrence strategy includes strengthening the country's detention and deportation
capability. No longer will criminals and other high risk deportable aliens be released back into communities
because of a shortage of detention space and ineffective deportation procedures.
A. COMPREHENSIVE DEPORTATION PROCESS REFORM
The Department of Justice, in consultation with other relevant agencies, shall develop a streamlined, fair,
and effective procedure to expedite removal of deportable aliens. As necessary, additional legislative authority
will be sought in this area. In addition, the Department of Justice shall increase its capacity to staff deportation
and exclusion hearings to support these objectives.
B. NATIONAL DETENTION AND REMOVAL PLAN
To address the shortage of local detention space for illegal aliens, the Administration shall devise a National
Detention, Transportation, and Removal Policy that will permit use of detention space across the United States
and improve the ability to remove individuals with orders of deportation. The Department of Justice, in
consultation with other agencies as appropriate and working under the auspices of the White House
Interagency Working Group on Immigration, shall finalize this plan by April 30, 1995.
The Administration will seek support and funding from the Congress for this plan and for our efforts to
double the removal of illegal aliens with final orders of deportation.
C. IDENTIFICATION AND REMOVAL OF CRIMINAL ALIENS
The Institutional Hearing Program is successfully expediting deportation of incarcerated criminal aliens
after they serve their sentences.
To further expedite removal of criminal aliens from this country and reduce costs to Federal and State
governments, the Department of Justice is directed to develop an expanded program of verification of the
immigration status of criminal aliens within our country's prisons. In developing this program, the viability of
expanding the work of the Law Enforcement Support Center should be assessed and all necessary steps taken
to increase coordination and cooperative efforts with State, and local law enforcement officers in
identification of criminal aliens.
TARGETED DETERRENCE AREAS
Many of the Administration's illegal immigration enforcement initiatives are mutually reinforcing. For
example, strong interior enforcement supports border control. While there have been efforts over the years at
piecemeal cooperation, this Administration will examine, develop, and test a more comprehensive coordinated
package of deterrence strategies in selected metropolitan areas by multiple Federal, State, and local agencies.
The White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration shall coordinate the development of this
interagency and intergovernmental operation.
VERIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS
The law denies most government benefits to illegal aliens. The government has a duty to assure that
taxpayer-supported public assistance programs are not abused. As with work authorization, enforcement of
eligibility requirements relies upon a credible system of verification. The INS, working with the White House
Interagency Working Group on Immigration as appropriate, shall review means of improving the existing
benefits verification program. In addition, we will seek new mechanisms—including increased penalties for
false information used to qualify for benefits—to protect the integrity of public programs.
ANTI-DISCRIMINATION
Our efforts to combat illegal immigration must not violate the privacy and civil rights of legal immigrants
and U.S. citizens. Therefore, I direct the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the
Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and other relevant Administration officials to
vigorously protect our citizens and legal immigrants from immigration-related instances of discrimination and
harassment. All illegal immigration enforcement measures shall be taken with due regard for the basic human
rights of individuals and in accordance with our obligations under applicable international agreements.
ASSISTANCE TO STATES
States today face significant costs for services provided to illegal immigrants as a result of failed policies of
the past. Deterring illegal immigration is the best long-term solution to protect States from growing costs for
[Release Point 118-106]
illegal immigration. This is the first Administration to address this primary responsibility squarely. We are
targeting most of our Federal dollars to those initiatives that address the root causes that lead to increased
burdens on States.
The Federal Government provides States with billions of dollars to provide for health care, education, and
other services and benefits for immigrants. This Administration is proposing increases for immigration and
immigration-related spending of 25 percent in 1996 compared to 1993 levels. In addition, this Administration
is the first to obtain funding from the Congress to reimburse States for a share of the costs of incarcerated
illegal aliens.
This Administration will continue to work with States to obtain more Federal help for certain State costs
and will oppose inappropriate cost-shifting to the States.
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
This Administration will continue to emphasize international cooperative efforts to address illegal
immigration.
Pursuant to a Presidential Review Directive (PRD), the Department of State is now coordinating a study on
United States policy toward international refugee and migration affairs. I hereby direct that, as part of that
PRD process, this report to the National Security Council include the relationship of economic development
and migration in the Western Hemisphere and, in particular, provide recommendations for further foreign
economic policy measures to address causes of illegal immigration.
The Department of State shall coordinate an interagency effort to consider expanded arrangements with
foreign governments for return of criminal and deportable aliens.
The Department of State also shall seek to negotiate readmission agreements for persons who could have
sought asylum in the last country from which they arrived. Such agreements will take due regard of U.S.
obligations under the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.
The Department of State further shall implement cooperative efforts with other nations receiving smuggled
aliens or those used as transhipment points by smugglers. In particular, we will look to countries in our
hemisphere to join us by denying their territory as bases for smuggling operations.
The Department of State shall initiate negotiations with foreign countries to secure authority for the United
States Coast Guard to board source country vessels suspected of transporting smuggled aliens.
This directive shall be published in the Federal Register.

Ex. Ord. No. 13993, Jan. 20, 2021, 86 F.R. 7051, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Policy. Immigrants have helped strengthen America's families, communities, businesses and
workforce, and economy, infusing the United States with creativity, energy, and ingenuity. The task of
enforcing the immigration laws is complex and requires setting priorities to best serve the national interest.
The policy of my Administration is to protect national and border security, address the humanitarian
challenges at the southern border, and ensure public health and safety. We must also adhere to due process of
law as we safeguard the dignity and well-being of all families and communities. My Administration will reset

J.R. BIDEN, JR.
EX. ORD. NO. 14010. CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL FRAMEWORK TO
ADDRESS THE CAUSES OF MIGRATION, TO MANAGE MIGRATION THROUGHOUT
NORTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA, AND TO PROVIDE SAFE AND ORDERLY
PROCESSING OF ASYLUM SEEKERS AT THE UNITED STATES BORDER
Ex. Ord. No. 14010, Feb. 2, 2021, 86 F.R. 8267, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Policy. For generations, immigrants have come to the United States with little more than the
clothes on their backs, hope in their hearts, and a desire to claim their own piece of the American Dream.
These mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters have made our Nation better and stronger.
The United States is also a country with borders and with laws that must be enforced. Securing our borders
does not require us to ignore the humanity of those who seek to cross them. The opposite is true. We cannot
solve the humanitarian crisis at our border without addressing the violence, instability, and lack of opportunity
that compel so many people to flee their homes. Nor is the United States safer when resources that should be
invested in policies targeting actual threats, such as drug cartels and human traffickers, are squandered on
efforts to stymie legitimate asylum seekers.
Consistent with these principles, my Administration will implement a multi-pronged approach toward
managing migration throughout North and Central America that reflects the Nation's highest values. We will
work closely with civil society, international organizations, and the governments in the region to: establish a
comprehensive strategy for addressing the causes of migration in the region; build, strengthen, and expand
Central and North American countries' asylum systems and resettlement capacity; and increase opportunities
for vulnerable populations to apply for protection closer to home. At the same time, the United States will
enhance lawful pathways for migration to this country and will restore and strengthen our own asylum system,
which has been badly damaged by policies enacted over the last 4 years that contravened our values and
caused needless human suffering.
SEC. 2. United States Strategies for Addressing the Root Causes of Irregular Migration and for
Collaboratively Managing Migration in the Region. (a) The Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs (APNSA), in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of
Homeland Security, and the heads of any other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall as soon as
possible prepare:
(i) the United States Strategy for Addressing the Root Causes of Migration (the "Root Causes Strategy");
and
(ii) the United States Strategy for Collaboratively Managing Migration in the Region (the "Collaborative
Management Strategy").
(b) The Root Causes Strategy shall identify and prioritize actions to address the underlying factors leading
to migration in the region and ensure coherence of United States Government positions. The Root Causes
Strategy shall take into account, as appropriate, the views of bilateral, multilateral, and private sector partners,
as well as civil society, and it shall include proposals to:
(i) coordinate place-based efforts in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras (the "Northern Triangle") to
address the root causes of migration, including by:
(A) combating corruption, strengthening democratic governance, and advancing the rule of law;
(B) promoting respect for human rights, labor rights, and a free press;
(C) countering and preventing violence, extortion, and other crimes perpetrated by criminal gangs,
trafficking networks, and other organized criminal organizations;
(D) combating sexual, gender-based, and domestic violence; and
(E) addressing economic insecurity and inequality;
(ii) consult and collaborate with the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of
Commerce, and the Secretary of Labor to evaluate compliance with the Dominican Republic-Central America
Free Trade Agreement to ensure that unfair labor practices do not disadvantage competition; and
(iii) encourage the deployment of Northern Triangle domestic resources and the development of Northern
Triangle domestic capacity to replicate and scale efforts to foster sustainable societies across the region.
(c) The Collaborative Management Strategy shall identify and prioritize actions to strengthen cooperative
[Release Point 118-106]
efforts to address migration flows, including by expanding and improving upon previous efforts to resettle
throughout the region those migrants who qualify for humanitarian protection. The Collaborative Management
Strategy should focus on programs and infrastructure that facilitate access to protection and other lawful
immigration avenues, in both the United States and partner countries, as close to migrants' homes as possible.
Priorities should include support for expanding pathways through which individuals facing difficult or
dangerous conditions in their home countries can find stability and safety in receiving countries throughout
the region, not only through asylum and refugee resettlement, but also through labor and other
non-protection-related programs. To support the development of the Collaborative Management Strategy, the
United States Government shall promptly begin consultations with civil society, the private sector,
international organizations, and governments in the region, including the Government of Mexico. These
consultations should address:
(i) the continued development of asylum systems and resettlement capacities of receiving countries in the
region, including through the provision of funding, training, and other support;
(ii) the development of internal relocation and integration programs for internally displaced persons, as well
as return and reintegration programs for returnees in relevant countries of the region; and
(iii) humanitarian assistance, including through expansion of shelter networks, to address the immediate
needs of individuals who have fled their homes to seek protection elsewhere in the region.
SEC. 3. Expansion of Lawful Pathways for Protection and Opportunity in the United States. (a) The
Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly review mechanisms for better
identifying and processing individuals from the Northern Triangle who are eligible for refugee resettlement to
the United States. Consideration shall be given to increasing access and processing efficiency. As part of this
review, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall also identify and implement all
legally available and appropriate forms of relief to complement the protection afforded through the United
States Refugee Admissions Program. The Secretary of State and Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit
a report to the President with the results of the review.
(b) As part of the review conducted pursuant to section 3(a) of this order, the Secretary of Homeland
Security shall:
(i) consider taking all appropriate actions to reverse the 2017 decision rescinding the Central American
Minors (CAM) parole policy and terminating the CAM Parole Program, see "Termination of the Central
American Minors Parole Program," 82 FR 38,926 (August 16, 2017), and consider initiating appropriate
actions to reinstitute and improve upon the CAM Parole Program; and
(ii) consider promoting family unity by exercising the Secretary's discretionary parole authority to permit
certain nationals of the Northern Triangle who are the beneficiaries of approved family-sponsored immigrant
visa petitions to join their family members in the United States, on a case-by-case basis.
(c) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly evaluate and implement
measures to enhance access for individuals from the Northern Triangle to visa programs, as appropriate and
consistent with applicable law.
SEC. 4. Restoring and Enhancing Asylum Processing at the Border. (a) Resuming the Safe and Orderly
Processing of Asylum Claims at United States Land Borders.
(i) The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), in coordination with the Secretary of State, shall promptly begin consultation and planning with
international and non-governmental organizations to develop policies and procedures for the safe and orderly
processing of asylum claims at United States land borders, consistent with public health and safety and
capacity constraints.
(ii) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health
and Human Services (HHS), and the Director of CDC, shall promptly begin taking steps to reinstate the safe
and orderly reception and processing of arriving asylum seekers, consistent with public health and safety and
capacity constraints. Additionally, in furtherance of this goal, as appropriate and consistent with applicable
law:
(A) The Secretary of HHS and the Director of CDC, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland
Security, shall promptly review and determine whether termination, rescission, or modification of the
following actions is necessary and appropriate: "Order Suspending the Right To Introduce Certain Persons
From Countries Where a Quarantinable Communicable Disease Exists," 85 FR 65,806 (October 13, 2020);
and "Control of Communicable Diseases; Foreign Quarantine: Suspension of the Right to Introduce and
Prohibition of Introduction of Persons into United States from Designated Foreign Countries or Places for
Public Health Purposes," 85 FR 56,424 (September 11, 2020) (codified at 42 CFR 71.40).
(B) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly review and determine whether to terminate or
modify the program known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), including by considering whether to
[Release Point 118-106]
rescind the Memorandum of the Secretary of Homeland Security titled "Policy Guidance for
Implementation of the Migrant Protection Protocols" (January 25, 2019), and any implementing guidance.
In coordination with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of CDC, the Secretary of
Homeland Security shall promptly consider a phased strategy for the safe and orderly entry into the United
States, consistent with public health and safety and capacity constraints, of those individuals who have been
subjected to MPP for further processing of their asylum claims.
(C) The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly review and
determine whether to rescind the interim final rule titled "Aliens Subject to a Bar on Entry Under Certain
Presidential Proclamations; Procedures for Protection Claims," 83 FR 55,934 (November 9, 2018), and the
final rule titled "Asylum Eligibility and Procedural Modifications," 85 FR 82,260 (December 17, 2020), as
well as any agency memoranda or guidance that were issued in reliance on those rules.
(D) The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly review and
determine whether to rescind the interim final rule titled "Implementing Bilateral and Multilateral Asylum
Cooperative Agreements Under the Immigration and Nationality Act," 84 FR 63,994 (November 19, 2019),
as well as any agency memoranda or guidance issued in reliance on that rule. In the interim, the Secretary
of State shall promptly consider whether to notify the governments of the Northern Triangle that, as efforts
to establish a cooperative, mutually respectful approach to managing migration across the region begin, the
United States intends to suspend and terminate the following agreements:
(1) "Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of
the Republic of Guatemala on Cooperation Regarding the Examination of Protection Claims," 84 FR
64,095 (July 26, 2019).
(2) "Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of
the Republic of El Salvador for Cooperation in the Examination of Protection Claims," 85 FR 83,597

EX. ORD. NO. 14012. RESTORING FAITH IN OUR LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEMS AND
STRENGTHENING INTEGRATION AND INCLUSION EFFORTS FOR NEW AMERICANS
Ex. Ord. No. 14012, Feb. 2, 2021, 86 F.R. 8277, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
it is hereby ordered as follows:
[Release Point 118-106]
SECTION 1. Policy. Over 40 million foreign-born individuals live in the United States today. Millions
more Americans have immigrants in their families or ancestry. New Americans and their children fuel our
economy, working in every industry, including healthcare, construction, caregiving, manufacturing, service,
and agriculture. They open and successfully run businesses at high rates, creating jobs for millions, and they
contribute to our arts, culture, and government, providing new traditions, customs, and viewpoints. They are
essential workers helping to keep our economy afloat and providing important services to Americans during a
global pandemic. They have helped the United States lead the world in science, technology, and innovation.
And they are on the frontlines of research to develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) vaccines and
treatments for those afflicted with the deadly disease.
Consistent with our character as a Nation of opportunity and of welcome, it is essential to ensure that our
laws and policies encourage full participation by immigrants, including refugees, in our civic life; that
immigration processes and other benefits are delivered effectively and efficiently; and that the Federal
Government eliminates sources of fear and other barriers that prevent immigrants from accessing government
services available to them. Our Nation is enriched socially and economically by the presence of immigrants,
and we celebrate with them as they take the important step of becoming United States citizens. The Federal
Government should develop welcoming strategies that promote integration, inclusion, and citizenship, and it
should embrace the full participation of the newest Americans in our democracy.
SEC. 2. Role of the Domestic Policy Council. The role of the White House Domestic Policy Council (DPC)
is to convene executive departments and agencies (agencies) to coordinate the formulation and
implementation of my Administration's domestic policy objectives. Consistent with that role, the DPC shall
coordinate the Federal Government's efforts to welcome and support immigrants, including refugees, and to
catalyze State and local integration and inclusion efforts. In furtherance of these goals, the DPC shall convene
a Task Force on New Americans, which shall include members of agencies that implement policies that
impact immigrant communities.
SEC. 3. Restoring Trust in our Legal Immigration System. The Secretary of State, the Attorney General,
and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall review existing regulations, orders, guidance documents,
policies, and any other similar agency actions (collectively, agency actions) that may be inconsistent with the
policy set forth in section 1 of this order.
(a) In conducting this review, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland
Security shall:
(i) identify barriers that impede access to immigration benefits and fair, efficient adjudications of these
benefits and make recommendations on how to remove these barriers, as appropriate and consistent with
applicable law; and
(ii) identify any agency actions that fail to promote access to the legal immigration system—such as the
final rule entitled, "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Fee Schedule and Changes to Certain Other
Immigration Benefit Request Requirements," 85 Fed. Reg. 46788 (Aug. 3, 2020), in light of the Emergency
Stopgap USCIS Stabilization Act (title I of division D of Public Law 116–159)—and recommend steps, as
appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to revise or rescind those agency actions.
(b) Within 90 days of the date of this order [Feb. 2, 2021], the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and
the Secretary of Homeland Security shall each submit a plan to the President describing the steps their
respective agencies will take to advance the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.
(c) Within 180 days of submitting the plan described in subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of State,
the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall each submit a report to the President
describing the progress of their respective agencies towards implementing the plan developed pursuant to
subsection (b) of this section and recognizing any areas of concern or barriers to implementing the plan.
SEC. 4. Immediate Review of Agency Actions on Public Charge Inadmissibility. The Secretary of State, the
Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the heads of other relevant agencies, as
appropriate, shall review all agency actions related to implementation of the public charge ground of
inadmissibility in section 212(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), and
the related ground of deportability in section 237(a)(5) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(5). They shall, in
considering the effects and implications of public charge policies, consult with the heads of relevant agencies,
including the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development.
(a) This review should:
(i) consider and evaluate the current effects of these agency actions and the implications of their continued
implementation in light of the policy set forth in section 1 of this order;
(ii) identify appropriate agency actions, if any, to address concerns about the current public charge policies'
effect on the integrity of the Nation's immigration system and public health; and
[Release Point 118-106]
(iii) recommend steps that relevant agencies should take to clearly communicate current public charge
policies and proposed changes, if any, to reduce fear and confusion among impacted communities.
(b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary
of Homeland Security shall each submit a report to the President describing any agency actions identified
pursuant to subsection (a)(ii) of this section and any steps their agencies intend to take or have taken,
consistent with subsection (a)(iii) of this section.
SEC. 5. Promoting Naturalization.
(a) Improving the naturalization process. The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of
Homeland Security shall, within 60 days of the date of this order, develop a plan describing any agency
actions, in furtherance of the policy set forth in section 1 of this order, that they will take to:
(i) eliminate barriers in and otherwise improve the existing naturalization process, including by conducting
a comprehensive review of that process with particular emphasis on the N–400 application, fingerprinting,
background and security checks, interviews, civics and English language tests, and the oath of allegiance;
(ii) substantially reduce current naturalization processing times;
(iii) make the naturalization process more accessible to all eligible individuals, including through a potential
reduction of the naturalization fee and restoration of the fee waiver process;
(iv) facilitate naturalization for eligible candidates born abroad and members of the military, in consultation
with the Department of Defense; and
(v) review policies and practices regarding denaturalization and passport revocation to ensure that these
authorities are not used excessively or inappropriately.
(b) Implementing improvements to the naturalization process. Within 180 days of the issuance of the plan
developed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the
Secretary of Homeland Security shall each submit a report to the President describing the progress in
implementing the plan, any barriers to implementing the plan, and any additional areas of concern that should
be addressed to ensure that eligible individuals are able to apply for naturalization in a fair and efficient
manner.
(c) Strategy to promote naturalization. There is established an Interagency Working Group on Promoting
Naturalization (Naturalization Working Group) to develop a national strategy to promote naturalization. The
Naturalization Working Group shall be chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Secretary's
designee, and it shall include the heads of the following agencies, or senior-level officials designated by the
head of each agency:
(i) the Secretary of Labor;
(ii) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;

(iv) the Secretary of Education;
(v) the Secretary of Homeland Security;
(vi) the Commissioner of Social Security; and

(d) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Naturalization Working Group shall submit a strategy to the
President outlining steps the Federal Government should take to promote naturalization, including the
potential development of a public awareness campaign.
SEC. 6. Revocation. The Presidential Memorandum of May 23, 2019 (Enforcing the Legal Responsibilities
of Sponsors of Aliens), is revoked. The heads of relevant agencies shall review any investigations or
compliance actions initiated pursuant to that memorandum and shall determine whether to suspend, as
appropriate, any investigations or compliance actions inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of this
order. The heads of relevant agencies shall review any agency actions developed pursuant to that
memorandum and, as appropriate, issue revised guidance consistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of

CREATING WELCOMING COMMUNITIES AND FULLY INTEGRATING IMMIGRANTS AND
REFUGEES
Memorandum of President of the United States, Nov. 21, 2014, 79 F.R. 70765, provided:
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Our country has long been a beacon of hope and opportunity for people from around the world. Nearly 40
million foreign-born residents nationwide contribute to their communities every day, including 3 million
refugees who have resettled here since 1975. These new Americans significantly improve our economy. They
make up 13 percent of the population, but are over 16 percent of the labor force and start 28 percent of all new
businesses. Moreover, immigrants or their children have founded more than 40 percent of Fortune 500
companies, which collectively employ over 10 million people worldwide and generate annual revenues of
$4.2 trillion.
By focusing on the civic, economic, and linguistic integration of new Americans, we can help immigrants
and refugees in the United States contribute fully to our economy and their communities. Civic integration
provides new Americans with security in their rights and liberties. Economic integration empowers
immigrants to be self-sufficient and allows them to give back to their communities and contribute to economic
growth. English language acquisition allows new Americans to attain employment or career advancement and
be more active civic participants.
Our success as a Nation of immigrants is rooted in our ongoing commitment to welcoming and integrating
newcomers into the fabric of our country. It is important that we develop a Federal immigrant integration
strategy that is innovative and competitive with those of other industrialized nations and supports mechanisms
to ensure that our Nation's diverse people are contributing to society to their fullest potential.
Therefore, I am establishing a White House Task Force on New Americans, an interagency effort to
identify and support State and local efforts at integration that are working and to consider how to expand and
replicate successful models. The Task Force, which will engage with community, business, and faith leaders,
as well as State and local elected officials, will help determine additional steps the Federal Government can
take to ensure its programs and policies are serving diverse communities that include new Americans.
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
I hereby order as follows:
SECTION 1. White House Task Force on New Americans. (a) There is established a White House Task
Force on New Americans (Task Force) to develop a coordinated Federal strategy to better integrate new
Americans into communities and support State and local efforts to do the same. It shall be co-chaired by the
Director of the Domestic Policy Council and Secretary of Homeland Security, or their designees. In addition
to the Co-Chairs, the Task Force shall consist of the following members:
(i) the Secretary of State;
(ii) the Attorney General;
(iii) the Secretary of Agriculture;
(iv) the Secretary of Commerce;
(v) the Secretary of Labor;
(vi) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;
(vii) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;
(viii) the Secretary of Transportation;
(ix) the Secretary of Education;
(x) the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National and Community Service;
(xi) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;
(xii) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;
(xiii) the Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public
Engagement;
(xiv) the Director of the National Economic Council;
(xv) the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism; and
(xvi) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.
(b) A member of the Task Force may designate a senior-level official who is from the member's
department, agency, or office, and is a full-time officer or employee of the Federal Government, to perform
day-to-day Task Force functions of the member. At the direction of the Co-Chairs, the Task Force may
establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Task Force members or their designees under this subsection, as
appropriate.
(c) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall appoint an Executive Director who will determine the Task
Force's agenda, convene regular meetings of the Task Force, and supervise work under the direction of the
Co-Chairs. The Department of Homeland Security shall provide funding and administrative support for the
[Release Point 118-106]
Task Force to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations. Each executive
department or agency shall bear its own expenses for participating in the Task Force.
SEC. 2. Mission and Function of the Task Force. (a) The Task Force shall, consistent with applicable law,
work across executive departments and agencies to:
(i) review the policies and programs of all relevant executive departments and agencies to ensure they are
responsive to the needs of new Americans and the receiving communities in which they reside, and identify
ways in which such programs can be used to increase meaningful engagement between new Americans and
the receiving community;
(ii) identify and disseminate best practices at the State and local level;
(iii) provide technical assistance, training, or other support to existing Federal grantees to increase their

(iv) collect and disseminate immigrant integration data, policies, and programs that affect numerous

department, agency, or office to further the civic, economic, and linguistic integration of new Americans,
including a report on the status of any offices or programs that have been created to develop, implement, or
monitor targeted initiatives concerning immigrant integration; and
(ii) recommendations for issues, programs, or initiatives that should be further evaluated, studied, and
implemented, as appropriate.
(c) The Task Force shall provide, within 1 year of the date of this memorandum, a status report to the
President regarding the implementation of this memorandum. The Task Force shall review and update the
Integration Plan periodically, as appropriate, and shall present to the President any updated recommendations
or findings.
SEC. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary,
administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of
appropriations.
(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or
procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

the Federal Register.

COMBATING HIGH NONIMMIGRANT OVERSTAY RATES
Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 22, 2019, 84 F.R. 19853, provided:
Memorandum for the Secretary of State[,] the Attorney General[, and] the Secretary of Homeland Security
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United
States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Policy. (a) My Administration is committed to securing the borders of the United States and
fostering respect for the laws of our country, both of which are cornerstones of our Republic. Nonimmigrant
visa (visa) overstay rates are unacceptably high for nationals of certain countries. Aliens must abide by the
terms and conditions of their visas for our immigration system to function as intended. Although the United
States benefits from legitimate nonimmigrant entry, individuals who abuse the visa process and decline to
[Release Point 118-106]
abide by the terms and conditions of their visas, including their visa departure dates, undermine the integrity
of our immigration system and harm the national interest.
(b) The large numbers of aliens who overstay their period of lawful admission, failing to comply with the
terms of a visa or the Visa Waiver Program, place significant strain on Department of Justice and Department
of Homeland Security resources, which are currently needed to address the national emergency on our
southern border.
SEC. 2. Addressing High Visa Overstay Rates. (a) The Secretary of State shall engage with the
governments of countries with a total overstay rate greater than 10 percent in the combined B–1 and B–2
nonimmigrant visa category based on the Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2018 Entry/Exit
Overstay Report. This engagement should identify conditions contributing to high overstay rates among
nationals of those countries and methods to address those conditions.
(b) Within 120 days of the date of this memorandum [Apr. 22, 2019], the Secretary of State, in consultation
with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall provide to the President
recommendations to reduce B–1 and B–2 nonimmigrant visa overstay rates from the identified countries. With
respect to any of the identified countries, the recommendations may include, as appropriate and to the extent
consistent with applicable law, a proclamation, relying on authorities such as sections 212(f) and 215[(a)] of
the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a)), suspending or limiting entry of nationals of those countries who hold
B–1 or B–2 visas; targeted suspension of visa issuance for certain nationals; limits to duration of admission, to
be implemented by the Department of Homeland Security; and additional documentary requirements.
(c) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall immediately begin taking all
appropriate actions that are within the scope of their respective authorities to reduce overstay rates for all
classes of nonimmigrant visas.
(d) Within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide to
the President a summary of the Department of Homeland Security's ongoing efforts to reduce overstays from
countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program, to include any recommendations for additional action
necessary and appropriate to ensure the integrity and security of that Program.
SEC. 3. Admission Bonds. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take steps to

PRESERVING AND FORTIFYING DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS (DACA)
Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 20, 2021, 86 F.R. 7053, provided:
Memorandum for the Attorney General [and] the Secretary of Homeland Security
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, it is hereby
ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Policy. In 2012, during the Obama-Biden Administration, the Secretary of Homeland Security
issued a memorandum outlining how, in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, the Department of Homeland
Security should enforce the Nation's immigration laws against certain young people. This memorandum,
known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) guidance, deferred the removal of certain
undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, have obeyed the law, and
stayed in school or enlisted in the military. DACA and associated regulations permit eligible individuals who
pass a background check to request temporary relief from removal and to apply for temporary work permits.
DACA reflects a judgment that these immigrants should not be a priority for removal based on humanitarian
[Release Point 118-106]
concerns and other considerations, and that work authorization will enable them to support themselves and
their families, and to contribute to our economy, while they remain.
SEC. 2. Preserving and Fortifying DACA. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the
Attorney General, shall take all actions he deems appropriate, consistent with applicable law, to preserve and
fortify DACA.
SEC. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary,
administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.
(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or
procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
(d) The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the
Federal Register.

the child's parent being lawfully admitted for permanent residence, if the petition is later
converted, due to the naturalization of the parent, to a petition to classify the alien as an immediate
relative under subsection (b)(2)(A)(i), the determination described in paragraph (1) shall be made
using the age of the alien on the date of the parent's naturalization.
(3) Age on marriage termination date
In the case of a petition under section 1154 of this title initially filed for an alien's classification
as a family-sponsored immigrant under section 1153(a)(3) of this title, based on the alien's being a
married son or daughter of a citizen, if the petition is later converted, due to the legal termination
of the alien's marriage, to a petition to classify the alien as an immediate relative under subsection
(b)(2)(A)(i) or as an unmarried son or daughter of a citizen under section 1153(a)(1) of this title,
the determination described in paragraph (1) shall be made using the age of the alien on the date of
the termination of the marriage.

numbers made available under section 1153(b) of this title is equal to the ratio of the worldwide
level of immigration under section 1151(c) of this title to such level under section 1151(d) of this
title;
(2) except as provided in subsection (a)(4), the proportion of the visa numbers made available
under each of paragraphs (1) through (4) of section 1153(a) of this title is equal to the ratio of the
total number of visas made available under the respective paragraph to the total number of visas
made available under section 1153(a) of this title, and
(3) except as provided in subsection (a)(5), the proportion of the visa numbers made available
under each of paragraphs (1) through (5) of section 1153(b) of this title is equal to the ratio of the
total number of visas made available under the respective paragraph to the total number of visas
made available under section 1153(b) of this title.
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting the number of visas that may be issued to
natives of a foreign state or dependent area under section 1153(a) or 1153(b) of this title if there is
insufficient demand for visas for such natives under section 1153(b) or 1153(a) of this title,
respectively, or as limiting the number of visas that may be issued under section 1153(a)(2)(A) of

this title to classify any person who committed the battery or extreme cruelty or trafficking against
the individual (or the individual's child) which established the individual's (or individual's child 2)
eligibility as a VAWA petitioner or for such nonimmigrant status.
(2)(A) The Attorney General may not approve a spousal second preference petition for the
classification of the spouse of an alien if the alien, by virtue of a prior marriage, has been accorded
the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence as the spouse of a citizen of the
United States or as the spouse of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, unless—
(i) a period of 5 years has elapsed after the date the alien acquired the status of an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence, or
(ii) the alien establishes to the satisfaction of the Attorney General by clear and convincing
evidence that the prior marriage (on the basis of which the alien obtained the status of an alien
lawfully admitted for permanent residence) was not entered into for the purpose of evading any
provision of the immigration laws.
[Release Point 118-106]
In this subparagraph, the term "spousal second preference petition" refers to a petition, seeking

After an investigation of the facts in each case, and after consultation with the Secretary of Labor
with respect to petitions to accord a status under section 1153(b)(2) or 1153(b)(3) of this title, the
Attorney General shall, if he determines that the facts stated in the petition are true and that the alien
in behalf of whom the petition is made is an immediate relative specified in section 1151(b) of this
title or is eligible for preference under subsection (a) or (b) of section 1153 of this title, approve the
petition and forward one copy thereof to the Department of State. The Secretary of State shall then
authorize the consular officer concerned to grant the preference status.
(c) Limitation on orphan petitions approved for a single petitioner; prohibition against
approval in cases of marriages entered into in order to evade immigration laws; restriction
on future entry of aliens involved with marriage fraud
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) no petition shall be approved if (1) the alien has
previously been accorded, or has sought to be accorded, an immediate relative or preference status as
the spouse of a citizen of the United States or the spouse of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
residence, by reason of a marriage determined by the Attorney General to have been entered into for
the purpose of evading the immigration laws, or (2) the Attorney General has determined that the
alien has attempted or conspired to enter into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration
laws.

residence, or by an agency authorized by that State to conduct such a study, or, in the case of a child
adopted abroad, by an appropriate public or private adoption agency which is licensed in the United
States.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), no petition may be approved on
behalf of a child defined in section 1101(b)(1)(G) of this title unless the Secretary of State has
certified that the central authority of the child's country of origin has notified the United States
central authority under the convention referred to in such section 1101(b)(1)(G) of this title that a
United States citizen habitually resident in the United States has effected final adoption of the child,
or has been granted custody of the child for the purpose of emigration and adoption, in accordance
with such convention and the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C. 14901 et seq.].
(e) Subsequent finding of non-entitlement to preference classification
Nothing in this section shall be construed to entitle an immigrant, in behalf of whom a petition
under this section is approved, to be admitted 3 the United States as an immigrant under subsection
(a), (b), or (c) of section 1153 of this title or as an immediate relative under section 1151(b) of this
title if upon his arrival at a port of entry in the United States he is found not to be entitled to such
classification.
(f) Preferential treatment for children fathered by United States citizens and born in Korea,
Vietnam, Laos, Kampuchea, or Thailand after 1950 and before October 22, 1982

permanent residence, and

becomes eighteen years of age, in accordance with the laws of the State where the alien and the
sponsor will reside, and (II) to furnish, during the five-year period beginning on the date of the
alien's acquiring the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or during the
period beginning on the date of the alien's acquiring the status of an alien lawfully admitted for
permanent residence and ending on the date on which the alien becomes twenty-one years of age,
whichever period is longer, such financial support as is necessary to maintain the family in the
United States of which the alien is a member at a level equal to at least 125 per centum of the
current official poverty line (as established by the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget, under section 9902(2) of title 42 and as revised by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services under the second and third sentences of such section) for a family of the same size as the
size of the alien's family.
(B) A guarantee of legal custody and financial responsibility described in subparagraph (A) may
be enforced with respect to an alien against his sponsor in a civil suit brought by the Attorney
General in the United States district court for the district in which the sponsor resides, except that a
sponsor or his estate shall not be liable under such a guarantee if the sponsor dies or is adjudicated a
bankrupt under title 11.
(g) Restriction on petitions based on marriages entered while in exclusion or deportation
proceedings
Notwithstanding subsection (a), except as provided in section 1255(e)(3) of this title, a petition
may not be approved to grant an alien immediate relative status or preference status by reason of a
marriage which was entered into during the period described in section 1255(e)(2) of this title, until
the alien has resided outside the United States for a 2-year period beginning after the date of the
marriage.
[Release Point 118-106]
(h) Survival of rights to petition
The legal termination of a marriage may not be the sole basis for revocation under section 1155 of
this title of a petition filed under subsection (a)(1)(A)(iii) or a petition filed under subsection
(a)(1)(B)(ii) pursuant to conditions described in subsection (a)(1)(A)(iii)(I). Remarriage of an alien
whose petition was approved under subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) or (a)(1)(A)(iii) or marriage of an alien
described in clause (iv) or (vi) of subsection (a)(1)(A) or in subsection (a)(1)(B)(iii) shall not be the
basis for revocation of a petition approval under section 1155 of this title.
(i) Professional athletes
(1) In general
A petition under subsection (a)(4)(D) 4 for classification of a professional athlete shall remain
valid for the athlete after the athlete changes employers, if the new employer is a team in the same
sport as the team which was the employer who filed the petition.
(2) "Professional athlete" defined
For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "professional athlete" means an individual who is
employed as an athlete by—
(A) a team that is a member of an association of 6 or more professional sports teams whose
total combined revenues exceed $10,000,000 per year, if the association governs the conduct of
its members and regulates the contests and exhibitions in which its member teams regularly
engage; or
(B) any minor league team that is affiliated with such an association.
(j) Job flexibility for long delayed applicants for adjustment of status to permanent residence
A petition under subsection (a)(1)(D) 4 for an individual whose application for adjustment of
status pursuant to section 1255 of this title has been filed and remained unadjudicated for 180 days or
more shall remain valid with respect to a new job if the individual changes jobs or employers if the
new job is in the same or a similar occupational classification as the job for which the petition was
filed.
(k) Procedures for unmarried sons and daughters of citizens
(1) In general
Except as provided in paragraph (2), in the case of a petition under this section initially filed for
an alien unmarried son or daughter's classification as a family-sponsored immigrant under section
1153(a)(2)(B) of this title, based on a parent of the son or daughter being an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence, if such parent subsequently becomes a naturalized citizen of the
United States, such petition shall be converted to a petition to classify the unmarried son or
daughter as a family-sponsored immigrant under section 1153(a)(1) of this title.
(2) Exception
Paragraph (1) does not apply if the son or daughter files with the Attorney General a written
statement that he or she elects not to have such conversion occur (or if it has occurred, to have
such conversion revoked). Where such an election has been made, any determination with respect
to the son or daughter's eligibility for admission as a family-sponsored immigrant shall be made as
if such naturalization had not taken place.
(3) Priority date
Regardless of whether a petition is converted under this subsection or not, if an unmarried son
or daughter described in this subsection was assigned a priority date with respect to such petition
before such naturalization, he or she may maintain that priority date.
(4) Clarification
This subsection shall apply to a petition if it is properly filed, regardless of whether it was
approved or not before such naturalization.
[Release Point 118-106]
(l) Surviving relative consideration for certain petitions and applications
(1) In general
An alien described in paragraph (2) who resided in the United States at the time of the death of
the qualifying relative and who continues to reside in the United States shall have such petition
described in paragraph (2), or an application for adjustment of status to that of a person admitted
for lawful permanent residence based upon the family relationship described in paragraph (2), and
any related applications, adjudicated notwithstanding the death of the qualifying relative, unless
the Secretary of Homeland Security determines, in the unreviewable discretion of the Secretary,
that approval would not be in the public interest.
(2) Alien described
An alien described in this paragraph is an alien who, immediately prior to the death of his or her
qualifying relative, was—
(A) the beneficiary of a pending or approved petition for classification as an immediate

1992), the President shall enumerate, with the respective number of refugees so determined, the
number of aliens who were granted asylum in the previous year.
(b) Determinations by President respecting number of admissions for humanitarian concerns
If the President determines, after appropriate consultation, that (1) an unforeseen emergency
refugee situation exists, (2) the admission of certain refugees in response to the emergency refugee
situation is justified by grave humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest, and (3)
the admission to the United States of these refugees cannot be accomplished under subsection (a),
the President may fix a number of refugees to be admitted to the United States during the succeeding
period (not to exceed twelve months) in response to the emergency refugee situation and such
admissions shall be allocated among refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States in
accordance with a determination made by the President after the appropriate consultation provided
under this subsection.
(c) Admission by Attorney General of refugees; criteria; admission status of spouse or child;
applicability of other statutory requirements; termination of refugee status of alien, spouse
or child
(1) Subject to the numerical limitations established pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), the
Attorney General may, in the Attorney General's discretion and pursuant to such regulations as the
Attorney General may prescribe, admit any refugee who is not firmly resettled in any foreign
country, is determined to be of special humanitarian concern to the United States, and is admissible
(except as otherwise provided under paragraph (3)) as an immigrant under this chapter.
(2)(A) A spouse or child (as defined in section 1101(b)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) of this title) of
any refugee who qualifies for admission under paragraph (1) shall, if not otherwise entitled to
admission under paragraph (1) and if not a person described in the second sentence of section
1101(a)(42) of this title, be entitled to the same admission status as such refugee if accompanying, or
following to join, such refugee and if the spouse or child is admissible (except as otherwise provided
under paragraph (3)) as an immigrant under this chapter. Upon the spouse's or child's admission to
the United States, such admission shall be charged against the numerical limitation established in
accordance with the appropriate subsection under which the refugee's admission is charged.
(B) An unmarried alien who seeks to accompany, or follow to join, a parent granted admission as
a refugee under this subsection, and who was under 21 years of age on the date on which such parent
applied for refugee status under this section, shall continue to be classified as a child for purposes of
this paragraph, if the alien attained 21 years of age after such application was filed but while it was
pending.
(3) The provisions of paragraphs (4), (5), and (7)(A) of section 1182(a) of this title shall not be
applicable to any alien seeking admission to the United States under this subsection, and the
Attorney General may waive any other provision of such section (other than paragraph (2)(C) or
subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (E) of paragraph (3)) with respect to such an alien for humanitarian
purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest. Any such waiver by
the Attorney General shall be in writing and shall be granted only on an individual basis following an
investigation. The Attorney General shall provide for the annual reporting to Congress of the number
of waivers granted under this paragraph in the previous fiscal year and a summary of the reasons for
granting such waivers.
(4) The refugee status of any alien (and of the spouse or child of the alien) may be terminated by
the Attorney General pursuant to such regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe if the
Attorney General determines that the alien was not in fact a refugee within the meaning of section
[Release Point 118-106]
1101(a)(42) of this title at the time of the alien's admission.
(d) Oversight reporting and consultation requirements
(1) Before the start of each fiscal year the President shall report to the Committees on the Judiciary
of the House of Representatives and of the Senate regarding the foreseeable number of refugees who
will be in need of resettlement during the fiscal year and the anticipated allocation of refugee
admissions during the fiscal year. The President shall provide for periodic discussions between
designated representatives of the President and members of such committees regarding changes in
the worldwide refugee situation, the progress of refugee admissions, and the possible need for
adjustments in the allocation of admissions among refugees.
(2) As soon as possible after representatives of the President initiate appropriate consultation with
respect to the number of refugee admissions under subsection (a) or with respect to the admission of
refugees in response to an emergency refugee situation under subsection (b), the Committees on the
Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate shall cause to have printed in the
Congressional Record the substance of such consultation.
(3)(A) After the President initiates appropriate consultation prior to making a determination under
subsection (a), a hearing to review the proposed determination shall be held unless public disclosure
of the details of the proposal would jeopardize the lives or safety of individuals.
(B) After the President initiates appropriate consultation prior to making a determination, under
subsection (b), that the number of refugee admissions should be increased because of an unforeseen
emergency refugee situation, to the extent that time and the nature of the emergency refugee
situation permit, a hearing to review the proposal to increase refugee admissions shall be held unless
public disclosure of the details of the proposal would jeopardize the lives or safety of individuals.

admission of refugees and allocation of refugee admissions, discussions in person by designated
Cabinet-level representatives of the President with members of the Committees on the Judiciary of
the Senate and of the House of Representatives to review the refugee situation or emergency refugee

EX. ORD. NO. 14013. REBUILDING AND ENHANCING PROGRAMS TO RESETTLE REFUGEES
AND PLANNING FOR THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON MIGRATION
Ex. Ord. No. 14013, Feb. 4, 2021, 86 F.R. 8839, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
including the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., I hereby order as follows:
SECTION 1. Policy. The long tradition of the United States as a leader in refugee resettlement provides a
beacon of hope for persecuted people around the world, promotes stability in regions experiencing conflict,
and facilitates international collaboration to address the global refugee crisis. Through the United States
Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), the Federal Government, cooperating with private partners and
American citizens in communities across the country, demonstrates the generosity and core values of our
Nation, while benefitting from the many contributions that refugees make to our country. Accordingly, it shall
be the policy of my Administration that:
(a) USRAP and other humanitarian programs shall be administered in a manner that furthers our values as a
Nation and is consistent with our domestic law, international obligations, and the humanitarian purposes
expressed by the Congress in enacting the Refugee Act of 1980, Public Law 96–212 [see Tables for
classification].
(b) USRAP should be rebuilt and expanded, commensurate with global need and the purposes described
above.
(c) Delays in administering USRAP and other humanitarian programs are counter to our national interests,
can raise grave humanitarian concerns, and should be minimized.
[Release Point 118-106]
(d) Security vetting for USRAP applicants and applicants for other humanitarian programs should be
improved to be more efficient, meaningful, and fair, and should be complemented by sound methods of fraud
detection to ensure program integrity and protect national security.
(e) Although access to United States humanitarian programs is generally discretionary, the individuals
applying for immigration benefits under these programs must be treated with dignity and respect, without
improper discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, or other grounds, and should be
afforded procedural safeguards.
(f) United States humanitarian programs should be administered in a manner that ensures transparency and
accountability and reflects the principle that reunifying families is in the national interest.
(g) My Administration shall seek opportunities to enhance access to the refugee program for people who are
more vulnerable to persecution, including women, children, and other individuals who are at risk of
persecution related to their gender, gender expression, or sexual orientation.
(h) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) should explore the use of all available authorities for
humanitarian protection to assist individuals for whom USRAP is unavailable.
(i) To meet the challenges of restoring and expanding USRAP, the United States must innovate, including
by effectively employing technology and capitalizing on community and private sponsorship of refugees,
while continuing to partner with resettlement agencies for reception and placement.
(j) The Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) programs for Iraqi and Afghan allies provide humanitarian protection
to nationals of Iraq and Afghanistan experiencing an ongoing, serious threat because they provided faithful
and valuable service to the United States, including its troops serving in those countries. The Federal
Government should ensure that these important programs are administered without undue delay.
SEC. 2. Revocation, Rescission, and Reporting. (a) Executive Order 13815 of October 24, 2017 (Resuming
the United States Refugee Admissions Program With Enhanced Vetting Capabilities) [former 8 U.S.C. 1182
note], and Executive Order 13888 of September 26, 2019 (Enhancing State and Local Involvement in Refugee
Resettlement) [former 8 U.S.C. 1522 note], are revoked.
(b) The Presidential Memorandum of March 6, 2017 (Implementing Immediate Heightened Screening and
Vetting of Applications for Visas and Other Immigration Benefits, Ensuring Enforcement of All Laws for
Entry Into the United States, and Increasing Transparency Among Departments and Agencies of the Federal
Government and for the American People) [former 8 U.S.C. 1182 note], is revoked.
(c) Within 90 days of the date of this order [Feb. 4, 2021], the Secretary of State and the Secretary of
Homeland Security shall provide a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National
Security Affairs (APNSA), describing all agency actions, including memoranda or guidance documents, that
were taken or issued in reliance on or in furtherance of the directives revoked by subsections (a) and (b) of this
section. This report shall include recommendations regarding whether each action should be maintained,
reversed, or modified, consistent with applicable law and as appropriate for the fair, efficient, and secure
administration of the relevant humanitarian program or otherwise in the national interest.
SEC. 3. Special Immigrant Visas for Iraqi and Afghan Allies. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order,
the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security,
shall complete a review of the Iraqi and Afghan SIV programs and submit a report to the President with
recommendations to address any concerns identified. The report shall include:
(i) an assessment of agency compliance with existing law governing the SIV programs, including program
eligibility requirements and procedures for administrative review;
(ii) an assessment of whether there are undue delays in meeting statutory benchmarks for timely
adjudication of applications, including due to insufficient staffing levels;
(iii) a plan to provide training, guidance, and oversight with respect to the National Visa Center's processing
of SIV applications;
(iv) a plan to track the progress of the Senior Coordinators as provided under section 1245 of the Refugee
Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007 (RCIA), subtitle C of title XII of Public Law 110–181 [set out in a note above], and
section 602(b)(2)(D)(ii)(II) of the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009 (AAPA), title VI of division F of
Public Law 111–8 [8 U.S.C. 1101 note], as amended; and
(v) an assessment of whether adequate guidelines exist for reconsidering or reopening applications in
appropriate circumstances and consistent with applicable law.
(b) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall also direct a review of the
procedures for Chief of Mission approval of applications with the aim of, as appropriate and consistent with
applicable law:

opportunity to apply and demonstrate eligibility;
(ii) issuing guidance that would address situations where an applicant's employer is unable or unwilling to
[Release Point 118-106]
provide verification of the applicant's "faithful and valuable service," and provide for alternative forms of
verification;
(iii) revising requirements to facilitate the ability of applicants to demonstrate the existence of a qualifying
contract with the United States Government and require that the supervisor verifying the applicant's "faithful
and valuable service" be a United States citizen or national;
(iv) ensuring that applicants are not prejudiced by delays in verifying their employment; and
(v) implementing anti-fraud measures to ensure program integrity.
(c) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall submit to the President the results
of the review described in subsection (b) of this section.
(d) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of
Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall conduct a review and submit a report to the President
identifying whether additional populations not currently provided for under section 1059 of the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, Public Law 109–163 [8 U.S.C. 1101 note], section 1244 of
the RCIA, or section 602 of the AAPA are at risk as a result of their faithful and valuable service to the United
States Government. The review should also evaluate whether it would be appropriate to seek legislation that
would create a SIV program for individuals, regardless of nationality, who faithfully assisted the United States
Government in conflict areas for at least 1 year or made exceptional contributions in a shorter period and have
experienced or are experiencing an ongoing serious threat as a result of their service.
(e) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security
shall ensure that appropriate policies and procedures related to the SIV programs are publicly available on
their respective agency's websites, and that any revisions to such policies and procedures in the future are
made publicly available on those websites within 30 days of issuance.
SEC. 4. Steps to Improve the Efficacy, Integrity, Security, and Transparency of USRAP. (a) Consistent with
the policy set forth in section 1 of this order and to facilitate this order's effective and expeditious
implementation:
(i) The APNSA shall designate a National Security Council Senior Director to be responsible for
coordinating the agencies and vetting partners involved in USRAP.
(ii) The Secretary of State shall designate a senior-level employee to have primary responsibility for
overseeing refugee application processing, consistent with applicable law.

Opinion process and other inter-agency vetting processes for refugee applicants, including follow-to-join
refugee applicants, shall submit data to the National Vetting Governance Board on the number of staff
performing refugee security vetting, the thresholds for checks, and the rates at which checks have returned an
objection. Such data shall be disaggregated by age range, gender, and nationality of the refugee applicant. The
National Vetting Governance Board shall meet to consider if and how agency processes and staffing levels
[Release Point 118-106]
should change to improve security reviews and make refugee arrivals more efficient, and shall share any
conclusions and recommendations with the heads of relevant agencies, including the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget, in order to inform potential resourcing strategies where necessary.
(f) Within 60 days of the date of this order, agencies responsible for the Security Advisory Opinion process

to promulgate regulations and any other policies, including internal oversight mechanisms, to ensure the
quality, integrity, efficiency, and fairness of the adjudication process for USRAP applicants, while also taking
due account of the challenges facing refugee applicants. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation
with the Secretary of State, should consider adopting regulations or policies, as appropriate and consistent
with applicable law, that:

upon, where appropriate, to make specific factual and legal determinations necessary for the adjudication of
refugee applications from individuals or from individuals within a designated group of applicants;
(ii) ensure that refugee applicants have timely access to their own application records;
(iii) permit refugee applicants to have a representative at their interview at no cost to the United States

opportunity to present additional evidence and to request a review of the decision.

the APNSA, a report describing any action taken pursuant to subsection (g) of this section within 180 days
of the date such action is taken.
(i) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that adjudicators are trained in the standards governing
refugee claims of women, children, and other individuals who are more vulnerable to persecution due to their
age, gender, gender expression, or sexual orientation.
(j) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consider taking actions, as
appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to recognize as "spouses" for purposes of derivative status

shall provide the President a report, through the APNSA, describing any action taken pursuant to this
subsection within 180 days of the date such action is taken.

expand mechanisms under which non-governmental organizations with direct access to and knowledge of
refugees abroad in camps or other settings could identify and directly refer to USRAP particularly vulnerable
individuals who have a strong possibility of qualifying for admission to the United States as refugees.
(m) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security
shall take all appropriate steps, taking into account necessary safeguards for program integrity, to ensure that

the National Vetting Governance Board and United States Digital Service, shall conduct a review of refugee
security vetting processes and develop recommendations to increase their efficiency, fairness, and

EX. ORD. NO. 12208. CONSULTATIONS ON THE ADMISSION OF REFUGEES
§1158. Asylum
(a) Authority to apply for asylum
(1) In general
Any alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States
(whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United
States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters), irrespective of such
alien's status, may apply for asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, section
1225(b) of this title.
(2) Exceptions
(A) Safe third country
Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien if the Attorney General determines that the alien
may be removed, pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement, to a country (other than the
country of the alien's nationality or, in the case of an alien having no nationality, the country of
the alien's last habitual residence) in which the alien's life or freedom would not be threatened
on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political
opinion, and where the alien would have access to a full and fair procedure for determining a
claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection, unless the Attorney General finds that it is
in the public interest for the alien to receive asylum in the United States.
(B) Time limit
Subject to subparagraph (D), paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien unless the alien
demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year
after the date of the alien's arrival in the United States.
[Release Point 118-106]
(C) Previous asylum applications
Subject to subparagraph (D), paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien if the alien has
previously applied for asylum and had such application denied.
(D) Changed circumstances
An application for asylum of an alien may be considered, notwithstanding subparagraphs (B)
and (C), if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence
of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or
extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period
specified in subparagraph (B).
(E) Applicability
Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to an unaccompanied alien child (as defined in
section 279(g) of title 6).
(3) Limitation on judicial review
No court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under
paragraph (2).
(b) Conditions for granting asylum
(1) In general
(A) Eligibility
The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General may grant asylum to an alien
who has applied for asylum in accordance with the requirements and procedures established by
the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General under this section if the Secretary
of Homeland Security or the Attorney General determines that such alien is a refugee within the
meaning of section 1101(a)(42)(A) of this title.
(B) Burden of proof
(i) In general
The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish that the applicant is a refugee, within
the meaning of section 1101(a)(42)(A) of this title. To establish that the applicant is a refugee
within the meaning of such section, the applicant must establish that race, religion,
nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at
least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.
(ii) Sustaining burden
The testimony of the applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant's burden without
corroboration, but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant's testimony
is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the
applicant is a refugee. In determining whether the applicant has met the applicant's burden,
the trier of fact may weigh the credible testimony along with other evidence of record. Where
the trier of fact determines that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates
otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not
have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.
(iii) Credibility determination
Considering the totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors, a trier of fact may
base a credibility determination on the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant
or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant's or witness's account, the consistency
between the applicant's or witness's written and oral statements (whenever made and whether
or not under oath, and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made),
the internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other
evidence of record (including the reports of the Department of State on country conditions),
and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an
[Release Point 118-106]
inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's claim, or any other
relevant factor. There is no presumption of credibility, however, if no adverse credibility
determination is explicitly made, the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption
of credibility on appeal.
(2) Exceptions
(A) In general
Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien if the Attorney General determines that—
(i) the alien ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any
person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or
political opinion;
(ii) the alien, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime,
constitutes a danger to the community of the United States;
(iii) there are serious reasons for believing that the alien has committed a serious
nonpolitical crime outside the United States prior to the arrival of the alien in the United
States;
(iv) there are reasonable grounds for regarding the alien as a danger to the security of the
United States;
(v) the alien is described in subclause (I), (II), (III), (IV), or (VI) of section
1182(a)(3)(B)(i) of this title or section 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title (relating to terrorist
activity), unless, in the case only of an alien described in subclause (IV) of section
1182(a)(3)(B)(i) of this title, the Attorney General determines, in the Attorney General's
discretion, that there are not reasonable grounds for regarding the alien as a danger to the
security of the United States; or
(vi) the alien was firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the United States.
(B) Special rules
(i) Conviction of aggravated felony
For purposes of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), an alien who has been convicted of an
aggravated felony shall be considered to have been convicted of a particularly serious crime.
(ii) Offenses
The Attorney General may designate by regulation offenses that will be considered to be a
crime described in clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A).
(C) Additional limitations
The Attorney General may by regulation establish additional limitations and conditions,
consistent with this section, under which an alien shall be ineligible for asylum under paragraph
(1).
(D) No judicial review
There shall be no judicial review of a determination of the Attorney General under
subparagraph (A)(v).
(3) Treatment of spouse and children
(A) In general
A spouse or child (as defined in section 1101(b)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) of this title) of an
alien who is granted asylum under this subsection may, if not otherwise eligible for asylum
under this section, be granted the same status as the alien if accompanying, or following to join,
such alien.
(B) Continued classification of certain aliens as children
An unmarried alien who seeks to accompany, or follow to join, a parent granted asylum
under this subsection, and who was under 21 years of age on the date on which such parent
applied for asylum under this section, shall continue to be classified as a child for purposes of
[Release Point 118-106]
this paragraph and section 1159(b)(3) of this title, if the alien attained 21 years of age after such
application was filed but while it was pending.
(C) Initial jurisdiction
An asylum officer (as defined in section 1225(b)(1)(E) of this title) shall have initial
jurisdiction over any asylum application filed by an unaccompanied alien child (as defined in
section 279(g) of title 6), regardless of whether filed in accordance with this section or section
1225(b) of this title.
(c) Asylum status
(1) In general
In the case of an alien granted asylum under subsection (b), the Attorney General—
(A) shall not remove or return the alien to the alien's country of nationality or, in the case of a
person having no nationality, the country of the alien's last habitual residence;
(B) shall authorize the alien to engage in employment in the United States and provide the
alien with appropriate endorsement of that authorization; and
(C) may allow the alien to travel abroad with the prior consent of the Attorney General.
(2) Termination of asylum
Asylum granted under subsection (b) does not convey a right to remain permanently in the
United States, and may be terminated if the Attorney General determines that—
(A) the alien no longer meets the conditions described in subsection (b)(1) owing to a
fundamental change in circumstances;
(B) the alien meets a condition described in subsection (b)(2);
(C) the alien may be removed, pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement, to a country
(other than the country of the alien's nationality or, in the case of an alien having no nationality,
the country of the alien's last habitual residence) in which the alien's life or freedom would not
be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,
or political opinion, and where the alien is eligible to receive asylum or equivalent temporary
protection;
(D) the alien has voluntarily availed himself or herself of the protection of the alien's country
of nationality or, in the case of an alien having no nationality, the alien's country of last habitual
residence, by returning to such country with permanent resident status or the reasonable
possibility of obtaining such status with the same rights and obligations pertaining to other
permanent residents of that country; or
(E) the alien has acquired a new nationality and enjoys the protection of the country of his or
her new nationality.
(3) Removal when asylum is terminated
An alien described in paragraph (2) is subject to any applicable grounds of inadmissibility or
deportability under section 1 1182(a) and 1227(a) of this title, and the alien's removal or return
shall be directed by the Attorney General in accordance with sections 1229a and 1231 of this title.
(d) Asylum procedure
(1) Applications
The Attorney General shall establish a procedure for the consideration of asylum applications
filed under subsection (a). The Attorney General may require applicants to submit fingerprints and
a photograph at such time and in such manner to be determined by regulation by the Attorney
General.
(2) Employment
An applicant for asylum is not entitled to employment authorization, but such authorization may
be provided under regulation by the Attorney General. An applicant who is not otherwise eligible
for employment authorization shall not be granted such authorization prior to 180 days after the
date of filing of the application for asylum.
[Release Point 118-106]
(3) Fees
The Attorney General may impose fees for the consideration of an application for asylum, for
employment authorization under this section, and for adjustment of status under section 1159(b) of
this title. Such fees shall not exceed the Attorney General's costs in adjudicating the applications.
The Attorney General may provide for the assessment and payment of such fees over a period of
time or by installments. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the Attorney
General to charge fees for adjudication services provided to asylum applicants, or to limit the
authority of the Attorney General to set adjudication and naturalization fees in accordance with
section 1356(m) of this title.
(4) Notice of privilege of counsel and consequences of frivolous application
At the time of filing an application for asylum, the Attorney General shall—
(A) advise the alien of the privilege of being represented by counsel and of the consequences,
under paragraph (6), of knowingly filing a frivolous application for asylum; and
(B) provide the alien a list of persons (updated not less often than quarterly) who have
indicated their availability to represent aliens in asylum proceedings on a pro bono basis.
(5) Consideration of asylum applications
(A) Procedures
The procedure established under paragraph (1) shall provide that—
(i) asylum cannot be granted until the identity of the applicant has been checked against all
appropriate records or databases maintained by the Attorney General and by the Secretary of
State, including the Automated Visa Lookout System, to determine any grounds on which the
alien may be inadmissible to or deportable from the United States, or ineligible to apply for
or be granted asylum;
(ii) in the absence of exceptional circumstances, the initial interview or hearing on the
asylum application shall commence not later than 45 days after the date an application is
filed;
(iii) in the absence of exceptional circumstances, final administrative adjudication of the
asylum application, not including administrative appeal, shall be completed within 180 days
after the date an application is filed;
(iv) any administrative appeal shall be filed within 30 days of a decision granting or
denying asylum, or within 30 days of the completion of removal proceedings before an
immigration judge under section 1229a of this title, whichever is later; and
(v) in the case of an applicant for asylum who fails without prior authorization or in the
absence of exceptional circumstances to appear for an interview or hearing, including a
hearing under section 1229a of this title, the application may be dismissed or the applicant
may be otherwise sanctioned for such failure.
(B) Additional regulatory conditions
The Attorney General may provide by regulation for any other conditions or limitations on
the consideration of an application for asylum not inconsistent with this chapter.
(6) Frivolous applications
If the Attorney General determines that an alien has knowingly made a frivolous application for
asylum and the alien has received the notice under paragraph (4)(A), the alien shall be
permanently ineligible for any benefits under this chapter, effective as of the date of a final
determination on such application.
(7) No private right of action
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to create any substantive or procedural right or
benefit that is legally enforceable by any party against the United States or its agencies or officers
or any other person.
(e) Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
[Release Point 118-106]
The provisions of this section and section 1159(b) of this title shall apply to persons physically
present in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or arriving in the Commonwealth
(whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including persons who are brought to the
Commonwealth after having been interdicted in international or United States waters) only on or
after January 1, 2014.

§1160. Special agricultural workers
(a) Lawful residence
(1) In general
The Attorney General shall adjust the status of an alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for
temporary residence if the Attorney General determines that the alien meets the following
requirements:
(A) Application period
The alien must apply for such adjustment during the 18-month period beginning on the first
day of the seventh month that begins after November 6, 1986.
(B) Performance of seasonal agricultural services and residence in the United States
The alien must establish that he has—
(i) resided in the United States, and
(ii) performed seasonal agricultural services in the United States for at least 90 man-days,
during the 12-month period ending on May 1, 1986. For purposes of the previous sentence,
performance of seasonal agricultural services in the United States for more than one employer
on any one day shall be counted as performance of services for only 1 man-day.
(C) Admissible as immigrant
The alien must establish that he is admissible to the United States as an immigrant, except as
otherwise provided under subsection (c)(2).
(2) Adjustment to permanent residence
The Attorney General shall adjust the status of any alien provided lawful temporary resident
status under paragraph (1) to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence on the
following date:
(A) Group 1
Subject to the numerical limitation established under subparagraph (C), in the case of an alien
who has established, at the time of application for temporary residence under paragraph (1), that
the alien performed seasonal agricultural services in the United States for at least 90 man-days
during each of the 12-month periods ending on May 1, 1984, 1985, and 1986, the adjustment
shall occur on the first day after the end of the one-year period that begins on the later of (I) the
date the alien was granted such temporary resident status, or (II) the day after the last day of the
application period described in paragraph (1)(A).
(B) Group 2
In the case of aliens to which subparagraph (A) does not apply, the adjustment shall occur on
the day after the last day of the two-year period that begins on the later of (I) the date the alien
was granted such temporary resident status, or (II) the day after the last day of the application
period described in paragraph (1)(A).
(C) Numerical limitation
Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to more than 350,000 aliens. If more than 350,000 aliens
meet the requirements of such subparagraph, such subparagraph shall apply to the 350,000
aliens whose applications for adjustment were first filed under paragraph (1) and subparagraph
(B) shall apply to the remaining aliens.
(3) Termination of temporary residence
[Release Point 118-106]
(A) During the period of temporary resident status granted an alien under paragraph (1), the
Attorney General may terminate such status only upon a determination under this chapter that the
alien is deportable.
(B) Before any alien becomes eligible for adjustment of status under paragraph (2), the Attorney
General may deny adjustment to permanent status and provide for termination of the temporary
resident status granted such alien under paragraph (1) if—
(i) the Attorney General finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the adjustment to
temporary resident status was the result of fraud or willful misrepresentation as set out in
section 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) of this title, or
(ii) the alien commits an act that (I) makes the alien inadmissible to the United States as an
immigrant, except as provided under subsection (c)(2), or (II) is convicted of a felony or 3 or
more misdemeanors committed in the United States.
(4) Authorized travel and employment during temporary residence
During the period an alien is in lawful temporary resident status granted under this subsection,
the alien has the right to travel abroad (including commutation from a residence abroad) and shall
be granted authorization to engage in employment in the United States and shall be provided an
"employment authorized" endorsement or other appropriate work permit, in the same manner as
for aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
(5) In general
Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an alien who acquires the status of an alien
lawfully admitted for temporary residence under paragraph (1), such status not having changed, is
considered to be an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence (as described in section
1101(a)(20) of this title), other than under any provision of the immigration laws.
(b) Applications for adjustment of status
(1) To whom may be made
(A) Within the United States
The Attorney General shall provide that applications for adjustment of status under
subsection (a) may be filed—
(i) with the Attorney General, or
(ii) with a designated entity (designated under paragraph (2)), but only if the applicant
consents to the forwarding of the application to the Attorney General.
(B) Outside the United States
The Attorney General, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, shall provide a procedure
whereby an alien may apply for adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1) at an appropriate
consular office outside the United States. If the alien otherwise qualifies for such adjustment,
the Attorney General shall provide such documentation of authorization to enter the United
States and to have the alien's status adjusted upon entry as may be necessary to carry out the
provisions of this section.
(2) Designation of entities to receive applications
For purposes of receiving applications under this section, the Attorney General—
(A) shall designate qualified voluntary organizations and other qualified State, local,
community, farm labor organizations, and associations of agricultural employers, and
(B) may designate such other persons as the Attorney General determines are qualified and
have substantial experience, demonstrated competence, and traditional long-term involvement
in the preparation and submittal of applications for adjustment of status under section 1159 or
1255 of this title, Public Law 89–732 [8 U.S.C. 1255 note], or Public Law 95–145 [8 U.S.C.
1255 note].
(3) Proof of eligibility
(A) In general
[Release Point 118-106]
An alien may establish that he meets the requirement of subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) through
government employment records, records supplied by employers or collective bargaining
organizations, and such other reliable documentation as the alien may provide. The Attorney
General shall establish special procedures to credit properly work in cases in which an alien was
employed under an assumed name.
(B) Documentation of work history
(i) An alien applying for adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1) has the burden of
proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the alien has worked the requisite number of
man-days (as required under subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii)).
(ii) If an employer or farm labor contractor employing such an alien has kept proper and
adequate records respecting such employment, the alien's burden of proof under clause (i) may
be met by securing timely production of those records under regulations to be promulgated by
the Attorney General.
(iii) An alien can meet such burden of proof if the alien establishes that the alien has in fact
performed the work described in subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) by producing sufficient evidence to
show the extent of that employment as a matter of just and reasonable inference. In such a case,
the burden then shifts to the Attorney General to disprove the alien's evidence with a showing
which negates the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the evidence.
(4) Treatment of applications by designated entities
Each designated entity must agree to forward to the Attorney General applications filed with it
in accordance with paragraph (1)(A)(ii) but not to forward to the Attorney General applications
filed with it unless the applicant has consented to such forwarding. No such entity may make a
determination required by this section to be made by the Attorney General.
(5) Limitation on access to information
Files and records prepared for purposes of this section by designated entities operating under
this section are confidential and the Attorney General and the Service shall not have access to such
files or records relating to an alien without the consent of the alien, except as allowed by a court
order issued pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subsection.
(6) Confidentiality of information
(A) In general
Except as provided in this paragraph, neither the Attorney General, nor any other official or
employee of the Department of Justice, or bureau or agency thereof, may—
(i) use the information furnished by the applicant pursuant to an application filed under this
section for any purpose other than to make a determination on the application, including a
determination under subsection (a)(3)(B), or for enforcement of paragraph (7);
(ii) make any publication whereby the information furnished by any particular individual
can be identified; or
(iii) permit anyone other than the sworn officers and employees of the Department or
bureau or agency or, with respect to applications filed with a designated entity, that
designated entity, to examine individual applications.
(B) Required disclosures
The Attorney General shall provide information furnished under this section, and any other
information derived from such furnished information, to a duly recognized law enforcement
entity in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution, when such information is
requested in writing by such entity, or to an official coroner for purposes of affirmatively
identifying a deceased individual (whether or not such individual is deceased as a result of a
crime).
(C) Construction
(i) In general
[Release Point 118-106]
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the use, or release, for immigration
enforcement purposes or law enforcement purposes of information contained in files or
records of the Service pertaining to an application filed under this section, other than
information furnished by an applicant pursuant to the application, or any other information
derived from the application, that is not available from any other source.
(ii) Criminal convictions
Information concerning whether the applicant has at any time been convicted of a crime
may be used or released for immigration enforcement or law enforcement purposes.
(D) Crime
Whoever knowingly uses, publishes, or permits information to be examined in violation of
this paragraph shall be fined not more than $10,000.
(7) Penalties for false statements in applications
(A) Criminal penalty
Whoever—
(i) files an application for adjustment of status under this section and knowingly and
willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up a material fact or makes any false, fictitious, or
fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document
knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, or
(ii) creates or supplies a false writing or document for use in making such an application,
shall be fined in accordance with title 18 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
(B) Exclusion
An alien who is convicted of a crime under subparagraph (A) shall be considered to be
inadmissible to the United States on the ground described in section 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) of this
title.
(c) Waiver of numerical limitations and certain grounds for exclusion
(1) Numerical limitations do not apply
The numerical limitations of sections 1151 and 1152 of this title shall not apply to the
adjustment of aliens to lawful permanent resident status under this section.

[Release Point 118-106]
(C) Special rule for determination of public charge
An alien is not ineligible for adjustment of status under this section due to being inadmissible

United States evidencing self-support without reliance on public cash assistance.
(d) Temporary stay of exclusion or deportation and work authorization for certain applicants
(1) Before application period
The Attorney General shall provide that in the case of an alien who is apprehended before the
beginning of the application period described in subsection (a)(1) and who can establish a
nonfrivolous case of eligibility to have his status adjusted under subsection (a) (but for the fact
that he may not apply for such adjustment until the beginning of such period), until the alien has
had the opportunity during the first 30 days of the application period to complete the filing of an
application for adjustment, the alien—
(A) may not be excluded or deported, and
(B) shall be granted authorization to engage in employment in the United States and be
provided an "employment authorized" endorsement or other appropriate work permit.
(2) During application period
The Attorney General shall provide that in the case of an alien who presents a nonfrivolous
application for adjustment of status under subsection (a) during the application period, and until a
final determination on the application has been made in accordance with this section, the alien—
(A) may not be excluded or deported, and
(B) shall be granted authorization to engage in employment in the United States and be
provided an "employment authorized" endorsement or other appropriate work permit.
(3) Use of application fees to offset program costs
No application fees collected by the Service pursuant to this subsection may be used by the
Service to offset the costs of the special agricultural worker legalization program until the Service
implements the program consistent with the statutory mandate as follows:
(A) During the application period described in subsection (a)(1)(A) the Service may grant
temporary admission to the United States, work authorization, and provide an "employment
authorized" endorsement or other appropriate work permit to any alien who presents a
preliminary application for adjustment of status under subsection (a) at a designated port of
entry on the southern land border. An alien who does not enter through a port of entry is subject
to deportation and removal as otherwise provided in this chapter.
(B) During the application period described in subsection (a)(1)(A) any alien who has filed
an application for adjustment of status within the United States as provided in subsection
(b)(1)(A) pursuant to the provision of 8 CFR section 210.1(j) is subject to paragraph (2) of this
subsection.
(C) A preliminary application is defined as a fully completed and signed application with fee
and photographs which contains specific information concerning the performance of qualifying
employment in the United States and the documentary evidence which the applicant intends to
submit as proof of such employment. The applicant must be otherwise admissible to the United
States and must establish to the satisfaction of the examining officer during an interview that his
or her claim to eligibility for special agriculture worker status is credible.

(1) Administrative and judicial review
There shall be no administrative or judicial review of a determination respecting an application
for adjustment of status under this section except in accordance with this subsection.

The Attorney General shall establish an appellate authority to provide for a single level of
[Release Point 118-106]
administrative appellate review of such a determination.
(B) Standard for review
Such administrative appellate review shall be based solely upon the administrative record
established at the time of the determination on the application and upon such additional or
newly discovered evidence as may not have been available at the time of the determination.
(3) Judicial review
(A) Limitation to review of exclusion or deportation
There shall be judicial review of such a denial only in the judicial review of an order of
exclusion or deportation under section 1105a of this title (as in effect before October 1, 1996).
(B) Standard for judicial review
Such judicial review shall be based solely upon the administrative record established at the
time of the review by the appellate authority and the findings of fact and determinations
contained in such record shall be conclusive unless the applicant can establish abuse of
discretion or that the findings are directly contrary to clear and convincing facts contained in the
record considered as a whole.
(f) Temporary disqualification of newly legalized aliens from receiving aid to families with
dependent children
During the five-year period beginning on the date an alien was granted lawful temporary resident
status under subsection (a), and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the alien is not eligible
for assistance under a State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42
U.S.C. 601 et seq.]. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in the case of an alien who would be
eligible for assistance under a State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security
Act but for the previous sentence, the provisions of paragraph (3) of section 1255a(h) of this title
shall apply in the same manner as they apply with respect to paragraph (1) of such section and, for
this purpose, any reference in section 1255a(h)(3) of this title to paragraph (1) is deemed a reference
to the previous sentence.
(g) Treatment of special agricultural workers
For all purposes (subject to subsections (a)(5) and (f)) an alien whose status is adjusted under this
section to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, such status not having changed,
shall be considered to be an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence (within the meaning of
section 1101(a)(20) of this title).
(h) "Seasonal agricultural services" defined
In this section, the term "seasonal agricultural services" means the performance of field work
related to planting, cultural practices, cultivating, growing and harvesting of fruits and vegetables of
every kind and other perishable commodities, as defined in regulations by the Secretary of
Agriculture.

State and the Attorney General, may determine in such Secretary's sole unreviewable discretion that
subsection (a)(3)(B) shall not apply with respect to an alien within the scope of that subsection or
that subsection (a)(3)(B)(vi)(III) shall not apply to a group within the scope of that subsection,
except that no such waiver may be extended to an alien who is within the scope of subsection

this title, in his discretion parole into the United States temporarily under such conditions as he may
prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit
any alien applying for admission to the United States, but such parole of such alien shall not be
regarded as an admission of the alien and when the purposes of such parole shall, in the opinion of
the Attorney General, have been served the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody
from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner
as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.
(B) The Attorney General may not parole into the United States an alien who is a refugee unless

if no previous civil money penalty was imposed against the alien under section 1324c of this title

exists with respect to a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(U) of this title. The Secretary

financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United
States or by the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time
of admission or acquisition of status under section 1101(a)(15)(J) of this title was a national or
resident of a country which the Director of the United States Information Agency, pursuant to
regulations prescribed by him, had designated as clearly requiring the services of persons engaged in
the field of specialized knowledge or skill in which the alien was engaged, or (iii) who came to the
United States or acquired such status in order to receive graduate medical education or training, shall
be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa

[Release Point 118-106]
person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence
for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States: Provided, That
upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an interested United
States Government agency (or, in the case of an alien described in clause (iii), pursuant to the request
of a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), or of the Commissioner of Immigration
and Naturalization after he has determined that departure from the United States would impose
exceptional hardship upon the alien's spouse or child (if such spouse or child is a citizen of the
United States or a lawfully resident alien), or that the alien cannot return to the country of his
nationality or last residence because he would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion,
or political opinion, the Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign
residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the
Attorney General to be in the public interest except that in the case of a waiver requested by a State
Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an interested
United States Government agency on behalf of an alien described in clause (iii), the waiver shall be
subject to the requirements of section 1184(l) of this title: And provided further, That, except in the
case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may, upon the favorable
recommendation of the Director, waive such two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in
which the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last residence has furnished the Director a
statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of such alien.
(f) Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President
Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United
States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for
such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as
immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be
appropriate. Whenever the Attorney General finds that a commercial airline has failed to comply
with regulations of the Attorney General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection of
fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the United States (including the training of

and controls, if any, including the giving of bond, as the Attorney General, in the discretion of the
Attorney General after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, may by
regulation prescribe.
(h) Waiver of subsection (a)(2)(A)(i)(I), (II), (B), (D), and (E)
The Attorney General may, in his discretion, waive the application of subparagraphs (A)(i)(I), (B),
(D), and (E) of subsection (a)(2) and subparagraph (A)(i)(II) of such subsection insofar as it relates
to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana if—
(1)(A) in the case of any immigrant it is established to the satisfaction of the Attorney General
that—
(i) the alien is inadmissible only under subparagraph (D)(i) or (D)(ii) of such subsection or
the activities for which the alien is inadmissible occurred more than 15 years before the date of
the alien's application for a visa, admission, or adjustment of status,
(ii) the admission to the United States of such alien would not be contrary to the national

an attempt or conspiracy to commit murder or a criminal act involving torture. No waiver shall be
granted under this subsection in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the United
States as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if either since the date of such
admission the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony or the alien has not lawfully resided
continuously in the United States for a period of not less than 7 years immediately preceding the date

regarding a waiver under paragraph (1).
(j) Limitation on immigration of foreign medical graduates
(1) The additional requirements referred to in section 1101(a)(15)(J) of this title for an alien who
[Release Point 118-106]
is coming to the United States under a program under which he will receive graduate medical
education or training are as follows:
(A) A school of medicine or of one of the other health professions, which is accredited by a
body or bodies approved for the purpose by the Secretary of Education, has agreed in writing to
provide the graduate medical education or training under the program for which the alien is
coming to the United States or to assume responsibility for arranging for the provision thereof by
an appropriate public or nonprofit private institution or agency, except that, in the case of such an
agreement by a school of medicine, any one or more of its affiliated hospitals which are to
participate in the provision of the graduate medical education or training must join in the
agreement.
(B) Before making such agreement, the accredited school has been satisfied that the alien (i) is a
graduate of a school of medicine which is accredited by a body or bodies approved for the purpose
by the Secretary of Education (regardless of whether such school of medicine is in the United
States); or (ii)(I) has passed parts I and II of the National Board of Medical Examiners
Examination (or an equivalent examination as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services), (II) has competency in oral and written English, (III) will be able to adapt to the
educational and cultural environment in which he will be receiving his education or training, and
(IV) has adequate prior education and training to participate satisfactorily in the program for
which he is coming to the United States. For the purposes of this subparagraph, an alien who is a
graduate of a medical school shall be considered to have passed parts I and II of the National
Board of Medical Examiners examination if the alien was fully and permanently licensed to
practice medicine in a State on January 9, 1978, and was practicing medicine in a State on that
date.
(C) The alien has made a commitment to return to the country of his nationality or last residence
upon completion of the education or training for which he is coming to the United States, and the
government of the country of his nationality or last residence has provided a written assurance,
satisfactory to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, that there is a need in that country for
persons with the skills the alien will acquire in such education or training.
(D) The duration of the alien's participation in the program of graduate medical education or
training for which the alien is coming to the United States is limited to the time typically required
to complete such program, as determined by the Director of the United States Information Agency
at the time of the alien's admission into the United States, based on criteria which are established
in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and which take into
consideration the published requirements of the medical specialty board which administers such
education or training program; except that—
(i) such duration is further limited to seven years unless the alien has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Director that the country to which the alien will return at the end of such
specialty education or training has an exceptional need for an individual trained in such
specialty, and
(ii) the alien may, once and not later than two years after the date the alien is admitted to the
United States as an exchange visitor or acquires exchange visitor status, change the alien's
designated program of graduate medical education or training if the Director approves the
change and if a commitment and written assurance with respect to the alien's new program have
been provided in accordance with subparagraph (C).

Attorney General shall prescribe) that attests that the alien (i) is in good standing in the program of
graduate medical education or training in which the alien is participating, and (ii) will return to the
country of his nationality or last residence upon completion of the education or training for which
he came to the United States.

perform services as a member of the medical profession may not be admitted as a nonimmigrant
[Release Point 118-106]
under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title unless—
(A) the alien is coming pursuant to an invitation from a public or nonprofit private educational
or research institution or agency in the United States to teach or conduct research, or both, at or for
such institution or agency, or
(B)(i) the alien has passed the Federation licensing examination (administered by the Federation
of State Medical Boards of the United States) or an equivalent examination as determined by the
Secretary of Health and Human Services, and
(ii)(I) has competency in oral and written English or (II) is a graduate of a school of medicine
which is accredited by a body or bodies approved for the purpose by the Secretary of Education
(regardless of whether such school of medicine is in the United States).
(3) Omitted.
(k) Attorney General's discretion to admit otherwise inadmissible aliens who possess
immigrant visas
Any alien, inadmissible from the United States under paragraph (5)(A) or (7)(A)(i) of subsection
(a), who is in possession of an immigrant visa may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted in the
discretion of the Attorney General if the Attorney General is satisfied that inadmissibility was not
known to, and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence by, the
immigrant before the time of departure of the vessel or aircraft from the last port outside the United
States and outside foreign contiguous territory or, in the case of an immigrant coming from foreign
contiguous territory, before the time of the immigrant's application for admission.
(l) Guam and Northern Mariana Islands visa waiver program
(1) In general
The requirement of subsection (a)(7)(B)(i) may be waived by the Secretary of Homeland
Security, in the case of an alien applying for admission as a nonimmigrant visitor for business or
pleasure and solely for entry into and stay in Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands for a period not to exceed 45 days, if the Secretary of Homeland Security, after
consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of State, the Governor of Guam and
the Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, determines that—
(A) an adequate arrival and departure control system has been developed in Guam and the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and
(B) such a waiver does not represent a threat to the welfare, safety, or security of the United
States or its territories and commonwealths.
(2) Alien waiver of rights
An alien may not be provided a waiver under this subsection unless the alien has waived any
right—
(A) to review or appeal under this chapter an immigration officer's determination as to the
admissibility of the alien at the port of entry into Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands; or
(B) to contest, other than on the basis of an application for withholding of removal under
section 1231(b)(3) of this title or under the Convention Against Torture, or an application for
asylum if permitted under section 1158 of this title, any action for removal of the alien.
(3) Regulations
All necessary regulations to implement this subsection shall be promulgated by the Secretary of
Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of State, on
or before the 180th day after May 8, 2008. The promulgation of such regulations shall be
considered a foreign affairs function for purposes of section 553(a) of title 5. At a minimum, such
regulations should include, but not necessarily be limited to—
(A) a listing of all countries whose nationals may obtain the waiver also provided by this
subsection, except that such regulations shall provide for a listing of any country from which
[Release Point 118-106]
the Commonwealth has received a significant economic benefit from the number of visitors for
pleasure within the one-year period preceding May 8, 2008, unless the Secretary of Homeland
Security determines that such country's inclusion on such list would represent a threat to the
welfare, safety, or security of the United States or its territories; and
(B) any bonding requirements for nationals of some or all of those countries who may present
an increased risk of overstays or other potential problems, if different from such requirements
otherwise provided by law for nonimmigrant visitors.
(4) Factors
In determining whether to grant or continue providing the waiver under this subsection to
nationals of any country, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of
the Interior and the Secretary of State, shall consider all factors that the Secretary deems relevant,
including electronic travel authorizations, procedures for reporting lost and stolen passports,
repatriation of aliens, rates of refusal for nonimmigrant visitor visas, overstays, exit systems, and
information exchange.
(5) Suspension
The Secretary of Homeland Security shall monitor the admission of nonimmigrant visitors to
Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under this subsection. If the
Secretary determines that such admissions have resulted in an unacceptable number of visitors
from a country remaining unlawfully in Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands, unlawfully obtaining entry to other parts of the United States, or seeking withholding of
removal or asylum, or that visitors from a country pose a risk to law enforcement or security
interests of Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or of the United States
(including the interest in the enforcement of the immigration laws of the United States), the
Secretary shall suspend the admission of nationals of such country under this subsection. The
Secretary of Homeland Security may in the Secretary's discretion suspend the Guam and Northern
Mariana Islands visa waiver program at any time, on a country-by-country basis, for other good
cause.
(6) Addition of countries
The Governor of Guam and the Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands may request the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Homeland Security to add a
particular country to the list of countries whose nationals may obtain the waiver provided by this
subsection, and the Secretary of Homeland Security may grant such request after consultation with
the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of State, and may promulgate regulations with
respect to the inclusion of that country and any special requirements the Secretary of Homeland
Security, in the Secretary's sole discretion, may impose prior to allowing nationals of that country
to obtain the waiver provided by this subsection.
(m) Requirements for admission of nonimmigrant nurses

requirements which authorize the nurse to be employed) governing the place of intended
employment to engage in the practice of professional nursing as a registered nurse immediately
upon admission to the United States and is authorized under such laws to be employed by the
facility.

registered nurses similarly employed.
(iii) The alien employed by the facility will be paid the wage rate for registered nurses similarly
employed by the facility.
(iv) The facility has taken and is taking timely and significant steps designed to recruit and

(v) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute, the facility did not lay off
and will not lay off a registered nurse employed by the facility within the period beginning 90

at the facility through posting in conspicuous locations.
(vii) The facility will not, at any time, employ a number of aliens issued visas or otherwise
provided nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of this title that exceeds 33

(viii) The facility will not, with respect to any alien issued a visa or otherwise provided
nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of this title—
(I) authorize the alien to perform nursing services at any worksite other than a worksite
controlled by the facility; or
(II) transfer the place of employment of the alien from one worksite to another.

within 30 days of the date of filing, to registered nurses employed at the facility on the date of
filing.

workers to become registered nurses.
(iii) Paying registered nurses wages at a rate higher than currently being paid to registered
nurses similarly employed in the geographic area.

The steps described in this subparagraph shall not be considered to be an exclusive list of the

taking a second step is not reasonable.
(C) Subject to subparagraph (E), an attestation under subparagraph (A)—

attestation under subparagraph (A) (and accompanying documentation) and each such petition filed
by the facility.
(ii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process, including reasonable time limits, for the
receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting a facility's failure to meet conditions
attested to or a facility's misrepresentation of a material fact in an attestation. Complaints may be
filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including bargaining representatives, associations
deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties as determined under regulations of
the Secretary). The Secretary shall conduct an investigation under this clause if there is reasonable
cause to believe that a facility fails to meet conditions attested to. Subject to the time limits
established under this clause, this subparagraph shall apply regardless of whether an attestation is
expired or unexpired at the time a complaint is filed.
(iii) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 180 days after the date such a
complaint is filed, for a determination as to whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described
in clause (iv). If the Secretary determines that such a basis exists, the Secretary shall provide for
notice of such determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the
complaint within 60 days of the date of the determination.
(iv) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that a facility (for
which an attestation is made) has failed to meet a condition attested to or that there was a
misrepresentation of material fact in the attestation, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General
of such finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies (including civil
monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per nurse per violation, with the total penalty
not to exceed $10,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Upon receipt of

period of at least one year for nurses to be employed by the facility.
(v) In addition to the sanctions provided for under clause (iv), if the Secretary of Labor finds, after
notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that a facility has violated the condition attested to under
subparagraph (A)(iii) (relating to payment of registered nurses at the prevailing wage rate), the
Secretary shall order the facility to provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as may be
required to comply with such condition.
(F)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall impose on a facility filing an attestation under subparagraph

offered to H–1B nonimmigrants under subparagraph (A), United States workers for the job for
which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are sought; and
(II) has offered the job to any United States worker who applies and is equally or better
[Release Point 118-106]
qualified for the job for which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are sought.
(ii) The conditions described in clause (i) shall not apply to an application filed with respect to
the employment of an H–1B nonimmigrant who is described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of
section 1153(b)(1) of this title.
The employer shall make available for public examination, within one working day after the date
on which an application under this paragraph is filed, at the employer's principal place of business or
worksite, a copy of each such application (and such accompanying documents as are necessary). The
Secretary shall compile, on a current basis, a list (by employer and by occupational classification) of
the applications filed under this subsection. Such list shall include the wage rate, number of aliens
sought, period of intended employment, and date of need. The Secretary shall make such list
available for public examination in Washington, D.C. The Secretary of Labor shall review such an
application only for completeness and obvious inaccuracies. Unless the Secretary finds that the
application is incomplete or obviously inaccurate, the Secretary shall provide the certification
described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title within 7 days of the date of the filing of the
application. The application form shall include a clear statement explaining the liability under
subparagraph (F) of a placing employer if the other employer described in such subparagraph
displaces a United States worker as described in such subparagraph. Nothing in subparagraph (G)
shall be construed to prohibit an employer from using legitimate selection criteria relevant to the job
that are normal or customary to the type of job involved, so long as such criteria are not applied in a
discriminatory manner.
(2)(A) Subject to paragraph (5)(A), the Secretary shall establish a process for the receipt,
investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting a petitioner's failure to meet a condition
specified in an application submitted under paragraph (1) or a petitioner's misrepresentation of
material facts in such an application. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or
organization (including bargaining representatives). No investigation or hearing shall be conducted
on a complaint concerning such a failure or misrepresentation unless the complaint was filed not
later than 12 months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively. The Secretary
shall conduct an investigation under this paragraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that such a
failure or misrepresentation has occurred.
(B) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 30 days after the date such a complaint
is filed, for a determination as to whether or not a reasonable basis exists to make a finding described
in subparagraph (C). If the Secretary determines that such a reasonable basis exists, the Secretary
shall provide for notice of such determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a
hearing on the complaint, in accordance with section 556 of title 5, within 60 days after the date of
the determination. If such a hearing is requested, the Secretary shall make a finding concerning the
matter by not later than 60 days after the date of the hearing. In the case of similar complaints
respecting the same applicant, the Secretary may consolidate the hearings under this subparagraph on
such complaints.
(C)(i) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, a failure to meet a
condition of paragraph (1)(B), (1)(E), or (1)(F), a substantial failure to meet a condition of paragraph
(1)(C), (1)(D), or (1)(G)(i)(I), or a misrepresentation of material fact in an application—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, impose
such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed
$1,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed with respect to that employer under
section 1154 or 1184(c) of this title during a period of at least 1 year for aliens to be employed by
the employer.
(ii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a
condition of paragraph (1), a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application, or a
violation of clause (iv)—
[Release Point 118-106]
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, impose
such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed
$5,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed with respect to that employer under
section 1154 or 1184(c) of this title during a period of at least 2 years for aliens to be employed by
the employer.
(iii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a
condition of paragraph (1) or a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application, in the
course of which failure or misrepresentation the employer displaced a United States worker
employed by the employer within the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the
date of filing of any visa petition supported by the application—
(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, impose
such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed
$35,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate; and
(II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed with respect to that employer under
section 1154 or 1184(c) of this title during a period of at least 3 years for aliens to be employed by
the employer.
(iv) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed an application under this
subsection to intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner
discriminate against an employee (which term, for purposes of this clause, includes a former
employee and an applicant for employment) because the employee has disclosed information to the
employer, or to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of this
subsection, or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection, or because the employee
cooperates or seeks to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding concerning the employer's
compliance with the requirements of this subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this
subsection.
(v) The Secretary of Labor and the Attorney General shall devise a process under which an H–1B
nonimmigrant who files a complaint regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligible to
remain and work in the United States may be allowed to seek other appropriate employment in the
United States for a period not to exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such
nonimmigrant classification.
(vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed an application under this
subsection to require an H–1B nonimmigrant to pay a penalty for ceasing employment with the
employer prior to a date agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the employer. The Secretary shall
determine whether a required payment is a penalty (and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant
State law.
(II) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed an application under this
subsection to require an alien who is the subject of a petition filed under section 1184(c)(1) of this
title, for which a fee is imposed under section 1184(c)(9) of this title, to reimburse, or otherwise
compensate, the employer for part or all of the cost of such fee. It is a violation of this clause for
such an employer otherwise to accept such reimbursement or compensation from such an alien.
(III) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an employer has
committed a violation of this clause, the Secretary may impose a civil monetary penalty of $1,000
for each such violation and issue an administrative order requiring the return to the nonimmigrant of
any amount paid in violation of this clause, or, if the nonimmigrant cannot be located, requiring
payment of any such amount to the general fund of the Treasury.
(vii)(I) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an employer, who has filed an
application under this subsection and who places an H–1B nonimmigrant designated as a full-time
employee on the petition filed under section 1184(c)(1) of this title by the employer with respect to
the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment with the employer, in
nonproductive status due to a decision by the employer (based on factors such as lack of work), or
[Release Point 118-106]
due to the nonimmigrant's lack of a permit or license, to fail to pay the nonimmigrant full-time wages
in accordance with paragraph (1)(A) for all such nonproductive time.
(II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an employer, who has filed an
application under this subsection and who places an H–1B nonimmigrant designated as a part-time
employee on the petition filed under section 1184(c)(1) of this title by the employer with respect to
the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment with the employer, in
nonproductive status under circumstances described in subclause (I), to fail to pay such a
nonimmigrant for such hours as are designated on such petition consistent with the rate of pay
identified on such petition.
(III) In the case of an H–1B nonimmigrant who has not yet entered into employment with an
employer who has had approved an application under this subsection, and a petition under section
1184(c)(1) of this title, with respect to the nonimmigrant, the provisions of subclauses (I) and (II)
shall apply to the employer beginning 30 days after the date the nonimmigrant first is admitted into
the United States pursuant to the petition, or 60 days after the date the nonimmigrant becomes
eligible to work for the employer (in the case of a nonimmigrant who is present in the United States
on the date of the approval of the petition).
(IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to an H–1B nonimmigrant for
nonproductive time due to non-work-related factors, such as the voluntary request of the
nonimmigrant for an absence or circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant unable to work.
(V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer that is a school or other
educational institution from applying to an H–1B nonimmigrant an established salary practice of the
employer, under which the employer pays to H–1B nonimmigrants and United States workers in the
same occupational classification an annual salary in disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if—
(aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual salary payments prior to the
commencement of the employment; and
(bb) the application of the salary practice to the nonimmigrant does not otherwise cause the
nonimmigrant to violate any condition of the nonimmigrant's authorization under this chapter to
remain in the United States.
(VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause (viii).
(viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an employer who has filed an
application under this subsection to fail to offer to an H–1B nonimmigrant, during the
nonimmigrant's period of authorized employment, benefits and eligibility for benefits (including the
opportunity to participate in health, life, disability, and other insurance plans; the opportunity to
participate in retirement and savings plans; and cash bonuses and noncash compensation, such as
stock options (whether or not based on performance)) on the same basis, and in accordance with the
same criteria, as the employer offers to United States workers.
(D) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an employer has not paid
wages at the wage level specified under the application and required under paragraph (1), the
Secretary shall order the employer to provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as may be
required to comply with the requirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty under
subparagraph (C) has been imposed.
(E) If an H–1B-dependent employer places a nonexempt H–1B nonimmigrant with another
employer as provided under paragraph (1)(F) and the other employer has displaced or displaces a
United States worker employed by such other employer during the period described in such
paragraph, such displacement shall be considered for purposes of this paragraph a failure, by the
placing employer, to meet a condition specified in an application submitted under paragraph (1);
except that the Attorney General may impose a sanction described in subclause (II) of subparagraph
(C)(i), (C)(ii), or (C)(iii) only if the Secretary of Labor found that such placing employer—
(i) knew or had reason to know of such displacement at the time of the placement of the
nonimmigrant with the other employer; or
(ii) has been subject to a sanction under this subparagraph based upon a previous placement of
an H–1B nonimmigrant with the same other employer.
[Release Point 118-106]
(F) The Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, subject an employer to random investigations for
a period of up to 5 years, beginning on the date (on or after October 21, 1998) on which the
employer is found by the Secretary to have committed a willful failure to meet a condition of
paragraph (1) (or has been found under paragraph (5) to have committed a willful failure to meet the
condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II)) or to have made a willful misrepresentation of material fact in
an application. The preceding sentence shall apply to an employer regardless of whether or not the
employer is an H–1B-dependent employer. The authority of the Secretary under this subparagraph
shall not be construed to be subject to, or limited by, the requirements of subparagraph (A).
(G)(i) The Secretary of Labor may initiate an investigation of any employer that employs
nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title if the Secretary of Labor has
reasonable cause to believe that the employer is not in compliance with this subsection. In the case of
an investigation under this clause, the Secretary of Labor (or the acting Secretary in the case of the
absence of 9 disability of the Secretary of Labor) shall personally certify that reasonable cause exists
and shall approve commencement of the investigation. The investigation may be initiated for reasons
other than completeness and obvious inaccuracies by the employer in complying with this
subsection.
(ii) If the Secretary of Labor receives specific credible information from a source who is likely to
have knowledge of an employer's practices or employment conditions, or an employer's compliance
with the employer's labor condition application under paragraph (1), and whose identity is known to
the Secretary of Labor, and such information provides reasonable cause to believe that the employer
has committed a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F),
or (1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged in a pattern or practice of failures to meet such a condition, or has
committed a substantial failure to meet such a condition that affects multiple employees, the
Secretary of Labor may conduct an investigation into the alleged failure or failures. The Secretary of
Labor may withhold the identity of the source from the employer, and the source's identity shall not
be subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5.
(iii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a procedure for any person desiring to provide to the
Secretary of Labor information described in clause (ii) that may be used, in whole or in part, as the
basis for the commencement of an investigation described in such clause, to provide the information
in writing on a form developed and provided by the Secretary of Labor and completed by or on
behalf of the person. The person may not be an officer or employee of the Department of Labor,
unless the information satisfies the requirement of clause (iv)(II) (although an officer or employee of
the Department of Labor may complete the form on behalf of the person).
(iv) Any investigation initiated or approved by the Secretary of Labor under clause (ii) shall be
based on information that satisfies the requirements of such clause and that—
(I) originates from a source other than an officer or employee of the Department of Labor; or
(II) was lawfully obtained by the Secretary of Labor in the course of lawfully conducting
another Department of Labor investigation under this chapter of 9 any other Act.
(v) The receipt by the Secretary of Labor of information submitted by an employer to the Attorney
General or the Secretary of Labor for purposes of securing the employment of a nonimmigrant
described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title shall not be considered a receipt of information
for purposes of clause (ii).
(vi) No investigation described in clause (ii) (or hearing described in clause (viii) based on such
investigation) may be conducted with respect to information about a failure to meet a condition
described in clause (ii), unless the Secretary of Labor receives the information not later than 12
months after the date of the alleged failure.
(vii) The Secretary of Labor shall provide notice to an employer with respect to whom there is
reasonable cause to initiate an investigation described in clauses 10 (i) or (ii), prior to the
commencement of an investigation under such clauses, of the intent to conduct an investigation. The
notice shall be provided in such a manner, and shall contain sufficient detail, to permit the employer
to respond to the allegations before an investigation is commenced. The Secretary of Labor is not
[Release Point 118-106]
required to comply with this clause if the Secretary of Labor determines that to do so would interfere
with an effort by the Secretary of Labor to secure compliance by the employer with the requirements
of this subsection. There shall be no judicial review of a determination by the Secretary of Labor
under this clause.
(viii) An investigation under clauses 10 (i) or (ii) may be conducted for a period of up to 60 days.
If the Secretary of Labor determines after such an investigation that a reasonable basis exists to make
a finding that the employer has committed a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A),
(1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F), or (1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged in a pattern or practice of failures to meet
such a condition, or has committed a substantial failure to meet such a condition that affects multiple
employees, the Secretary of Labor shall provide for notice of such determination to the interested
parties and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 556 of title 5 within 120 days
after the date of the determination. If such a hearing is requested, the Secretary of Labor shall make a
finding concerning the matter by not later than 120 days after the date of the hearing.
(H)(i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), a person or entity is considered to have complied
with the requirements of this subsection, notwithstanding a technical or procedural failure to meet
such requirements, if there was a good faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
(ii) Clause (i) shall not apply if—
(I) the Department of Labor (or another enforcement agency) has explained to the person or
entity the basis for the failure;
(II) the person or entity has been provided a period of not less than 10 business days (beginning
after the date of the explanation) within which to correct the failure; and
(III) the person or entity has not corrected the failure voluntarily within such period.
(iii) A person or entity that, in the course of an investigation, is found to have violated the
prevailing wage requirements set forth in paragraph (1)(A), shall not be assessed fines or other
penalties for such violation if the person or entity can establish that the manner in which the
prevailing wage was calculated was consistent with recognized industry standards and practices.
(iv) Clauses (i) and (iii) shall not apply to a person or entity that has engaged in or is engaging in a
pattern or practice of willful violations of this subsection.
(I) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding or preempting any other
enforcement-related authority under this chapter (such as the authorities under section 1324b of this
title), or any other Act.
(3)(A) For purposes of this subsection, the term "H–1B-dependent employer" means an employer
that—
(i)(I) has 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees who are employed in the United States;
and (II) employs more than 7 H–1B nonimmigrants;
(ii)(I) has at least 26 but not more than 50 full-time equivalent employees who are employed in
the United States; and (II) employs more than 12 H–1B nonimmigrants; or
(iii)(I) has at least 51 full-time equivalent employees who are employed in the United States;
and (II) employs H–1B nonimmigrants in a number that is equal to at least 15 percent of the
number of such full-time equivalent employees.
(B) For purposes of this subsection—
(i) the term "exempt H–1B nonimmigrant" means an H–1B nonimmigrant who—
(I) receives wages (including cash bonuses and similar compensation) at an annual rate equal
to at least $60,000; or
(II) has attained a master's or higher degree (or its equivalent) in a specialty related to the
intended employment; and
(ii) the term "nonexempt H–1B nonimmigrant" means an H–1B nonimmigrant who is not an
exempt H–1B nonimmigrant.
(C) For purposes of subparagraph (A)—
[Release Point 118-106]
(i) in computing the number of full-time equivalent employees and the number of H–1B
nonimmigrants, exempt H–1B nonimmigrants shall not be taken into account during the longer
of—
(I) the 6-month period beginning on October 21, 1998; or
(II) the period beginning on October 21, 1998, and ending on the date final regulations are
issued to carry out this paragraph; and
(ii) any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414
of title 26 shall be treated as a single employer.
(4) For purposes of this subsection:
(A) The term "area of employment" means the area within normal commuting distance of the
worksite or physical location where the work of the H–1B nonimmigrant is or will be performed.
If such worksite or location is within a Metropolitan Statistical Area, any place within such area is
deemed to be within the area of employment.
(B) In the case of an application with respect to one or more H–1B nonimmigrants by an
employer, the employer is considered to "displace" a United States worker from a job if the
employer lays off the worker from a job that is essentially the equivalent of the job for which the
nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are sought. A job shall not be considered to be essentially
equivalent of another job unless it involves essentially the same responsibilities, was held by a
United States worker with substantially equivalent qualifications and experience, and is located in
the same area of employment as the other job.
(C) The term "H–1B nonimmigrant" means an alien admitted or provided status as a
nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title.
(D)(i) The term "lays off", with respect to a worker—
(I) means to cause the worker's loss of employment, other than through a discharge for
inadequate performance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary departure, voluntary
retirement, or the expiration of a grant or contract (other than a temporary employment contract
entered into in order to evade a condition described in subparagraph (E) or (F) of paragraph
(1)); but
(II) does not include any situation in which the worker is offered, as an alternative to such
loss of employment, a similar employment opportunity with the same employer (or, in the case
of a placement of a worker with another employer under paragraph (1)(F), with either employer
described in such paragraph) at equivalent or higher compensation and benefits than the
position from which the employee was discharged, regardless of whether or not the employee
accepts the offer.
(ii) Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to limit an employee's rights under a collective
bargaining agreement or other employment contract.
(E) The term "United States worker" means an employee who—
(i) is a citizen or national of the United States; or
(ii) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence, is admitted as a refugee
under section 1157 of this title, is granted asylum under section 1158 of this title, or is an
immigrant otherwise authorized, by this chapter or by the Attorney General, to be employed.
(5)(A) This paragraph shall apply instead of subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (2) in the
case of a violation described in subparagraph (B), but shall not be construed to limit or affect the
authority of the Secretary or the Attorney General with respect to any other violation.
(B) The Attorney General shall establish a process for the receipt, initial review, and disposition in
accordance with this paragraph of complaints respecting an employer's failure to meet the condition
of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II) or a petitioner's misrepresentation of material facts with respect to such
condition. Complaints may be filed by an aggrieved individual who has submitted a resume or
otherwise applied in a reasonable manner for the job that is the subject of the condition. No
[Release Point 118-106]
proceeding shall be conducted under this paragraph on a complaint concerning such a failure or
misrepresentation unless the Attorney General determines that the complaint was filed not later than
12 months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively.
(C) If the Attorney General finds that a complaint has been filed in accordance with subparagraph
(B) and there is reasonable cause to believe that such a failure or misrepresentation described in such
complaint has occurred, the Attorney General shall initiate binding arbitration proceedings by
requesting the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to appoint an arbitrator from the roster of
arbitrators maintained by such Service. The procedure and rules of such Service shall be applicable
to the selection of such arbitrator and to such arbitration proceedings. The Attorney General shall
pay the fee and expenses of the arbitrator.
(D)(i) The arbitrator shall make findings respecting whether a failure or misrepresentation
described in subparagraph (B) occurred. If the arbitrator concludes that failure or misrepresentation
was willful, the arbitrator shall make a finding to that effect. The arbitrator may not find such a
failure or misrepresentation (or that such a failure or misrepresentation was willful) unless the
complainant demonstrates such a failure or misrepresentation (or its willful character) by clear and
convincing evidence. The arbitrator shall transmit the findings in the form of a written opinion to the
parties to the arbitration and the Attorney General. Such findings shall be final and conclusive, and,
except as provided in this subparagraph, no official or court of the United States shall have power or
jurisdiction to review any such findings.
(ii) The Attorney General may review and reverse or modify the findings of an arbitrator only on
the same bases as an award of an arbitrator may be vacated or modified under section 10 or 11 of
title 9.
(iii) With respect to the findings of an arbitrator, a court may review only the actions of the
Attorney General under clause (ii) and may set aside such actions only on the grounds described in
subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of section 706(a)(2) of title 5. Notwithstanding any other provision of
law, such judicial review may only be brought in an appropriate United States court of appeals.
(E) If the Attorney General receives a finding of an arbitrator under this paragraph that an
employer has failed to meet the condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II) or has misrepresented a material
fact with respect to such condition, unless the Attorney General reverses or modifies the finding
under subparagraph (D)(ii)—
(i) the Attorney General may impose administrative remedies (including civil monetary
penalties in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per violation or $5,000 per violation in the case of a
willful failure or misrepresentation) as the Attorney General determines to be appropriate; and
(ii) the Attorney General is authorized to not approve petitions filed, with respect to that
employer and for aliens to be employed by the employer, under section 1154 or 1184(c) of this
title—
(I) during a period of not more than 1 year; or
(II) in the case of a willful failure or willful misrepresentation, during a period of not more
than 2 years.
(F) The Attorney General shall not delegate, to any other employee or official of the Department
of Justice, any function of the Attorney General under this paragraph, until 60 days after the
Attorney General has submitted a plan for such delegation to the Committees on the Judiciary of the
United States House of Representatives and the Senate.
(o) Omitted
(p) Computation of prevailing wage level
(1) In computing the prevailing wage level for an occupational classification in an area of
employment for purposes of subsections (a)(5)(A), (n)(1)(A)(i)(II), and (t)(1)(A)(i)(II) in the case of
an employee of—
(A) an institution of higher education (as defined in section 1001(a) of title 20), or a related or
affiliated nonprofit entity; or
(B) a nonprofit research organization or a Governmental research organization,
[Release Point 118-106]
the prevailing wage level shall only take into account employees at such institutions and
organizations in the area of employment.
(2) With respect to a professional athlete (as defined in subsection (a)(5)(A)(iii)(II)) when the job
opportunity is covered by professional sports league rules or regulations, the wage set forth in those
rules or regulations shall be considered as not adversely affecting the wages of United States workers
similarly employed and be considered the prevailing wage.
(3) The prevailing wage required to be paid pursuant to subsections (a)(5)(A), (n)(1)(A)(i)(II), and
(t)(1)(A)(i)(II) shall be 100 percent of the wage determined pursuant to those sections.
(4) Where the Secretary of Labor uses, or makes available to employers, a governmental survey to
determine the prevailing wage, such survey shall provide at least 4 levels of wages commensurate
with experience, education, and the level of supervision. Where an existing government survey has
only 2 levels, 2 intermediate levels may be created by dividing by 3, the difference between the 2
levels offered, adding the quotient thus obtained to the first level and subtracting that quotient from
the second level.
(q) Academic honoraria
Any alien admitted under section 1101(a)(15)(B) of this title may accept an honorarium payment
and associated incidental expenses for a usual academic activity or activities (lasting not longer than
9 days at any single institution), as defined by the Attorney General in consultation with the
Secretary of Education, if such payment is offered by an institution or organization described in
subsection (p)(1) and is made for services conducted for the benefit of that institution or entity and if
the alien has not accepted such payment or expenses from more than 5 institutions or organizations
in the previous 6-month period.
(r) Exception for certain alien nurses
Subsection (a)(5)(C) shall not apply to an alien who seeks to enter the United States for the
purpose of performing labor as a nurse who presents to the consular officer (or in the case of an
adjustment of status, the Attorney General) a certified statement from the Commission on Graduates
of Foreign Nursing Schools (or an equivalent independent credentialing organization approved for
the certification of nurses under subsection (a)(5)(C) by the Attorney General in consultation with

(3) the alien is a graduate of a nursing program—
(A) in which the language of instruction was English;
(B) located in a country—
(i) designated by such commission not later than 30 days after November 12, 1999, based
on such commission's assessment that the quality of nursing education in that country, and
the English language proficiency of those who complete such programs in that country,
justify the country's designation; or
(ii) designated on the basis of such an assessment by unanimous agreement of such
commission and any equivalent credentialing organizations which have been approved under
subsection (a)(5)(C) for the certification of nurses under this subsection; and
(C)(i) which was in operation on or before November 12, 1999; or
(ii) has been approved by unanimous agreement of such commission and any equivalent
credentialing organizations which have been approved under subsection (a)(5)(C) for the
certification of nurses under this subsection.
(s) Consideration of benefits received as battered alien in determination of inadmissibility as
likely to become public charge
[Release Point 118-106]
In determining whether an alien described in subsection (a)(4)(C)(i) is inadmissible under
subsection (a)(4) or ineligible to receive an immigrant visa or otherwise to adjust to the status of
permanent resident by reason of subsection (a)(4), the consular officer or the Attorney General shall
not consider any benefits the alien may have received that were authorized under section 1641(c) of

(A) The employer—
(i) is offering and will offer during the period of authorized employment to aliens admitted or
provided status under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of
this title wages that are at least—
(I) the actual wage level paid by the employer to all other individuals with similar
experience and qualifications for the specific employment in question; or
(II) the prevailing wage level for the occupational classification in the area of employment,
whichever is greater, based on the best information available as of the time of filing the

(i) has provided notice of the filing under this paragraph to the bargaining representative (if
any) of the employer's employees in the occupational classification and area for which aliens
are sought; or
(ii) if there is no such bargaining representative, has provided notice of filing in the
occupational classification through such methods as physical posting in conspicuous locations
at the place of employment or electronic notification to employees in the occupational
classification for which nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or
section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title are sought.
(D) A specification of the number of workers sought, the occupational classification in which
the workers will be employed, and wage rate and conditions under which they will be employed.

the date on which an attestation under this subsection is filed, at the employer's principal place of
business or worksite, a copy of each such attestation (and such accompanying documents as are
necessary).
(B)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall compile, on a current basis, a list (by employer and by
occupational classification) of the attestations filed under this subsection. Such list shall include,
with respect to each attestation, the wage rate, number of aliens sought, period of intended
employment, and date of need.
(ii) The Secretary of Labor shall make such list available for public examination in Washington,
D.C.
(C) The Secretary of Labor shall review an attestation filed under this subsection only for
completeness and obvious inaccuracies. Unless the Secretary of Labor finds that an attestation is
[Release Point 118-106]
incomplete or obviously inaccurate, the Secretary of Labor shall provide the certification described
in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title within 7 days
of the date of the filing of the attestation.
(3)(A) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and
disposition of complaints respecting the failure of an employer to meet a condition specified in an
attestation submitted under this subsection or misrepresentation by the employer of material facts in
such an attestation. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including
bargaining representatives). No investigation or hearing shall be conducted on a complaint
concerning such a failure or misrepresentation unless the complaint was filed not later than 12
months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively. The Secretary of Labor shall
conduct an investigation under this paragraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that such a
failure or misrepresentation has occurred.
(B) Under the process described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary of Labor shall provide, within
30 days after the date a complaint is filed, for a determination as to whether or not a reasonable basis
exists to make a finding described in subparagraph (C). If the Secretary of Labor determines that
such a reasonable basis exists, the Secretary of Labor shall provide for notice of such determination
to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the complaint, in accordance with section
556 of title 5, within 60 days after the date of the determination. If such a hearing is requested, the
Secretary of Labor shall make a finding concerning the matter by not later than 60 days after the date
of the hearing. In the case of similar complaints respecting the same applicant, the Secretary of
Labor may consolidate the hearings under this subparagraph on such complaints.
(C)(i) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, a failure to meet a
condition of paragraph (1)(B), a substantial failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(C) or (1)(D),
or a misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation—
(I) the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland
Security of such finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies
(including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per violation) as the
Secretary of Labor determines to be appropriate; and
(II) the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, shall not
approve petitions or applications filed with respect to that employer under section 1154, 1184(c),
1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1), or 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title during a period of at least 1 year for
aliens to be employed by the employer.
(ii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, a willful failure to
meet a condition of paragraph (1), a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation, or a
violation of clause (iv)—
(I) the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland
Security of such finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies
(including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation) as the
Secretary of Labor determines to be appropriate; and
(II) the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, shall not
approve petitions or applications filed with respect to that employer under section 1154, 1184(c),
1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1), or 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title during a period of at least 2 years for
aliens to be employed by the employer.
(iii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, a willful failure to
meet a condition of paragraph (1) or a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation, in
the course of which failure or misrepresentation the employer displaced a United States worker
employed by the employer within the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the
date of filing of any visa petition or application supported by the attestation—
(I) the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland
Security of such finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies
(including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $35,000 per violation) as the
[Release Point 118-106]
Secretary of Labor determines to be appropriate; and
(II) the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, shall not
approve petitions or applications filed with respect to that employer under section 1154, 1184(c),
1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1), or 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title during a period of at least 3 years for
aliens to be employed by the employer.
(iv) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed an attestation under this
subsection to intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner
discriminate against an employee (which term, for purposes of this clause, includes a former
employee and an applicant for employment) because the employee has disclosed information to the
employer, or to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of this
subsection, or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection, or because the employee
cooperates or seeks to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding concerning the employer's
compliance with the requirements of this subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this
subsection.
(v) The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall devise a process under
which a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii)
of this title who files a complaint regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligible to
remain and work in the United States may be allowed to seek other appropriate employment in the
United States for a period not to exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such
nonimmigrant classification.
(vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed an attestation under this
subsection to require a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section
1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title to pay a penalty for ceasing employment with the employer prior to a
date agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the employer. The Secretary of Labor shall determine
whether a required payment is a penalty (and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant State law.
(II) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an employer has
committed a violation of this clause, the Secretary of Labor may impose a civil monetary penalty of
$1,000 for each such violation and issue an administrative order requiring the return to the
nonimmigrant of any amount paid in violation of this clause, or, if the nonimmigrant cannot be
located, requiring payment of any such amount to the general fund of the Treasury.
(vii)(I) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an employer who has filed an
attestation under this subsection and who places a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1)
of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title designated as a full-time employee in the
attestation, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive
status due to a decision by the employer (based on factors such as lack of work), or due to the
nonimmigrant's lack of a permit or license, to fail to pay the nonimmigrant full-time wages in
accordance with paragraph (1)(A) for all such nonproductive time.
(II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an employer who has filed an
attestation under this subsection and who places a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1)
of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title designated as a part-time employee in the
attestation, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive
status under circumstances described in subclause (I), to fail to pay such a nonimmigrant for such
hours as are designated on the attestation consistent with the rate of pay identified on the attestation.
(III) In the case of a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section
1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title who has not yet entered into employment with an employer who has
had approved an attestation under this subsection with respect to the nonimmigrant, the provisions of
subclauses (I) and (II) shall apply to the employer beginning 30 days after the date the nonimmigrant
first is admitted into the United States, or 60 days after the date the nonimmigrant becomes eligible
to work for the employer in the case of a nonimmigrant who is present in the United States on the
date of the approval of the attestation filed with the Secretary of Labor.
(IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to a nonimmigrant under section
1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title for nonproductive time
[Release Point 118-106]
due to non-work-related factors, such as the voluntary request of the nonimmigrant for an absence or
circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant unable to work.
(V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer that is a school or other
educational institution from applying to a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this
title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title an established salary practice of the employer, under
which the employer pays to nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or
section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title and United States workers in the same occupational
classification an annual salary in disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if—
(aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual salary payments prior to the
commencement of the employment; and
(bb) the application of the salary practice to the nonimmigrant does not otherwise cause the
nonimmigrant to violate any condition of the nonimmigrant's authorization under this chapter to
remain in the United States.
(VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause (viii).
(viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an employer who has filed an
attestation under this subsection to fail to offer to a nonimmigrant under section
1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title, during the
nonimmigrant's period of authorized employment, benefits and eligibility for benefits (including the
opportunity to participate in health, life, disability, and other insurance plans; the opportunity to
participate in retirement and savings plans; and cash bonuses and non-cash compensation, such as
stock options (whether or not based on performance)) on the same basis, and in accordance with the
same criteria, as the employer offers to United States workers.
(D) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an employer has
not paid wages at the wage level specified in the attestation and required under paragraph (1), the
Secretary of Labor shall order the employer to provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as
may be required to comply with the requirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty under
subparagraph (C) has been imposed.
(E) The Secretary of Labor may, on a case-by-case basis, subject an employer to random
investigations for a period of up to 5 years, beginning on the date on which the employer is found by
the Secretary of Labor to have committed a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) or to
have made a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation. The authority of the
Secretary of Labor under this subparagraph shall not be construed to be subject to, or limited by, the
requirements of subparagraph (A).
(F) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding or preempting any other
enforcement-related authority under this chapter (such as the authorities under section 1324b of this
title), or any other Act.
(4) For purposes of this subsection:
(A) The term "area of employment" means the area within normal commuting distance of the
worksite or physical location where the work of the nonimmigrant under section
1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title is or will be performed.
If such worksite or location is within a Metropolitan Statistical Area, any place within such area is
deemed to be within the area of employment.
(B) In the case of an attestation with respect to one or more nonimmigrants under section
1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title or section 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of this title by an employer, the
employer is considered to "displace" a United States worker from a job if the employer lays off the
worker from a job that is essentially the equivalent of the job for which the nonimmigrant or
nonimmigrants is or are sought. A job shall not be considered to be essentially equivalent of
another job unless it involves essentially the same responsibilities, was held by a United States
worker with substantially equivalent qualifications and experience, and is located in the same area
of employment as the other job.
(C)(i) The term "lays off", with respect to a worker—
(I) means to cause the worker's loss of employment, other than through a discharge for
[Release Point 118-106]
inadequate performance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary departure, voluntary
retirement, or the expiration of a grant or contract; but
(II) does not include any situation in which the worker is offered, as an alternative to such
loss of employment, a similar employment opportunity with the same employer at equivalent or
higher compensation and benefits than the position from which the employee was discharged,
regardless of whether or not the employee accepts the offer.
(ii) Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to limit an employee's rights under a collective
bargaining agreement or other employment contract.
(D) The term "United States worker" means an employee who—
(i) is a citizen or national of the United States; or
(ii) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence, is admitted as a refugee
under section 1157 of this title, is granted asylum under section 1158 of this title, or is an
immigrant otherwise authorized, by this chapter or by the Secretary of Homeland Security, to be
employed.
12
(t) Foreign residence requirement
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person admitted under section 1101(a)(15)(Q)(ii)(I) of
this title, or acquiring such status after admission, shall be eligible to apply for nonimmigrant status,
an immigrant visa, or permanent residence under this chapter until it is established that such person
has resided and been physically present in the person's country of nationality or last residence for an
aggregate of at least 2 years following departure from the United States.
(2) The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive the requirement of such 2-year foreign
residence abroad if the Secretary determines that—
(A) departure from the United States would impose exceptional hardship upon the alien's spouse
or child (if such spouse or child is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for
permanent residence); or
(B) the admission of the alien is in the public interest or the national interest of the United
States.

"(a) IN GENERAL.—In evaluating a request from a covered individual for parole in place under section
212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)), the Secretary of Homeland Security
shall consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether granting the request would enable military family unity that
would constitute a significant public benefit.
"(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that—
"(1) parole in place reinforces the objective of military family unity;
"(2) except as required in furtherance of the missions of the Armed Forces, disruption to military
family unity should be minimized in order to enhance military readiness and allow members of the Armed
Forces to focus on the faithful execution of their military missions and objectives, with peace of mind
regarding the well-being of their family members; and
"(3) the importance of the parole in place authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security is
reaffirmed.
"(c) COVERED INDIVIDUAL DEFINED.—In this section, the term 'covered individual' means an alien
who—
"(1) is a member of the Armed Forces;

RECIPROCAL ACCESS TO TIBET
[Release Point 118-106]
Pub. L. 115–330, Dec. 19, 2018, 132 Stat. 4479, provided that:
"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
"This Act may be cited as the 'Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018'.
"SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
"Congress finds the following:
"(1) The Government of the People's Republic of China does not grant United States diplomats and
other officials, journalists, and other citizens access to China on a basis that is reciprocal to the access that
the Government of the United States grants Chinese diplomats and other officials, journalists, and citizens.
"(2) The Government of China imposes greater restrictions on travel to Tibetan areas than to other
areas of China.
"(3) Officials of China have stated that Tibet is open to foreign visitors.
"(4) The Government of China is promoting tourism in Tibetan areas, and at the Sixth Tibet Work
Forum in August 2015, Premier Li Keqiang called for Tibet to build 'major world tourism destinations'.
"(5) The Government of China requires foreigners to obtain permission from the Tibet Foreign and
Overseas Affairs Office or from the Tibet Tourism Bureau to enter the Tibet Autonomous Region, a
restriction that is not imposed on travel to any other provincial-level jurisdiction in China.
"(6) The Department of State reports that—
"(A) officials of the Government of the United States submitted 39 requests for diplomatic access
to the Tibet Autonomous Region between May 2011 and July 2015, but only four were granted; and
"(B) when such requests are granted, diplomatic personnel are closely supervised and given few
opportunities to meet local residents not approved by authorities.
"(7) The Government of China delayed United States consular access for more than 48 hours after an
October 28, 2013, bus crash in the Tibet Autonomous Region, in which three citizens of the United States
died and more than a dozen others, all from Walnut, California, were injured, undermining the ability of the
Government of the United States to provide consular services to the victims and their families, and failing
to meet China's obligations under the Convention on Consular Relations, done at Vienna April 24, 1963 (21
UST 77).
"(8) Following a 2015 earthquake that trapped dozens of citizens of the United States in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, the United States Consulate General in Chengdu faced significant challenges in
providing emergency consular assistance due to a lack of consular access.
"(9) The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015 of the Department of State stated 'With
the exception of a few highly controlled trips, the Chinese government also denied multiple requests by
foreign diplomats for permission to visit the TAR.'.
"(10) Tibetan-Americans, attempting to visit their homeland, report having to undergo a discriminatory
visa application process, different from what is typically required, at the Chinese embassy and consulates in
the United States, and often find their requests to travel denied.
"(11) The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016 of the Department of State stated 'The
few visits to the TAR by diplomats and journalists that were allowed were tightly controlled by local
authorities.'.
"(12) A September 2016 article in the Washington Post reported that 'The Tibet Autonomous Region .
. . is harder to visit as a journalist than North Korea.'.
"(13) The Government of China has failed to respond positively to requests from the Government of
the United States to open a consulate in Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region.
"(14) The Foreign Correspondents Club of China reports that—
"(A) 2008 rules prevent foreign reporters from visiting the Tibet Autonomous Region without
prior permission from the Government of such Region;
"(B) such permission has only rarely been granted; and
"(C) although the 2008 rules allow journalists to travel freely in other parts of China, Tibetan
areas outside such Region remain 'effectively off-limits to foreign reporters'.
"(15) The Department of State reports that in addition to having to obtain permission to enter the Tibet
Autonomous Region, foreign tourists—
"(A) must be accompanied at all times by a government-designated tour guide;
"(B) are rarely granted permission to enter the region by road;
"(C) are largely barred from visiting around the March anniversary of a 1959 Tibetan uprising;
and
"(D) are banned from visiting the area where Larung Gar, the world's largest center for the study
of Tibetan Buddhism, and the site of a large-scale campaign to expel students and demolish living
[Release Point 118-106]
quarters, is located.
"(16) Foreign visitors also face restrictions in their ability to travel freely in Tibetan areas outside the
Tibet Autonomous Region.
"(17) The Government of the United States generally allows journalists and other citizens of China to
travel freely within the United States. The Government of the United States requires diplomats from China
to notify the Department of State of their travel plans, and in certain situations, the Government of the
United States requires such diplomats to obtain approval from the Department of State before travel.
However, where approval is required, it is almost always granted expeditiously.
"(18) The United States regularly grants visas to Chinese diplomats and other officials, scholars, and
others who travel to the United States to discuss, promote, and display the perspective of the Government of
China on the situation in Tibetan areas, even as the Government of China restricts the ability of citizens of
the United States to travel to Tibetan areas to gain their own perspective.
"(19) Chinese diplomats based in the United States generally avail themselves of the freedom to travel
to United States cities and lobby city councils, mayors, and governors to refrain from passing resolutions,
issuing proclamations, or making statements of concern on Tibet.
"(20) The Government of China characterizes statements made by officials of the United States about
the situation in Tibetan areas as inappropriate interference in the internal affairs of China.

substantially involved in the formulation or execution of policies related to access for foreigners to Tibetan

areas may be eligible to receive a visa to enter the United States or be admitted to the United States if the
Secretary of State determines that—
"(1)(A) the requirement for specific official permission for foreigners to enter the Tibetan Autonomous
Region remains in effect; or
"(B) such requirement has been replaced by a regulation that has a similar effect and requires foreign
travelers to gain a level of permission to enter the Tibet Autonomous Region that is not required for travel
to other provinces in China; and
"(2) restrictions on travel by diplomats and other officials, journalists, and citizens of the United States
to areas designated as 'Tibetan Autonomous' in the provinces of Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Gansu of

November 21, 1947 (TIAS 1676), or any other applicable international obligation of the United States; or

submit to the appropriate congressional committees a document detailing the evidence and justification for
the necessity of such waiver, including, if such waiver is granted pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), how such

"SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
"It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State, when granting diplomats and other officials from
China access to parts of the United States, including consular access, should take into account the extent to
which the Government of China grants diplomats and other officials from the United States access to parts of
China, including the level of access afforded to such diplomats and other officials to Tibetan areas."

PROC. NO. 4865. HIGH SEAS INTERDICTION OF ILLEGAL ALIENS
Proc. No. 4865, Sept. 29, 1981, 46 F.R. 48107, provided:
The ongoing migration of persons to the United States in violation of our laws is a serious national problem
detrimental to the interests of the United States. A particularly difficult aspect of the problem is the continuing
illegal migration by sea of large numbers of undocumented aliens into the southeastern United States. These
arrivals have severely strained the law enforcement resources of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
and have threatened the welfare and safety of communities in that region.
As a result of our discussions with the Governments of affected foreign countries and with agencies of the
Executive Branch of our Government, I have determined that new and effective measures to curtail these
unlawful arrivals are necessary. In this regard, I have determined that international cooperation to intercept
vessels trafficking in illegal migrants is a necessary and proper means of insuring the effective enforcement of
our laws.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America, by the authority
vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including Sections 212(f) and 215(a)(1)
of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a)(1)), in order to protect the
sovereignty of the United States, and in accordance with cooperative arrangements with certain foreign
governments, and having found that the entry of undocumented aliens, arriving at the borders of the United
States from the high seas, is detrimental to the interests of the United States, do proclaim that:
The entry of undocumented aliens from the high seas is hereby suspended and shall be prevented by the
interdiction of certain vessels carrying such aliens.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of September, in the year of
our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two
hundred and sixth.

and 1185(a)(1)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in order to delegate appropriate
responsibilities to Federal agencies for responding to migration of undocumented aliens in the Caribbean
region, it is hereby ordered:
SECTION 1. Duties and Authorities of Agency Heads. Consistent with applicable law,
(a)(i) The Secretary of Homeland Security may maintain custody, at any location he deems appropriate, of
any undocumented aliens he has reason to believe are seeking to enter the United States and who are
interdicted or intercepted in the Caribbean region. In this regard, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall
provide and operate a facility, or facilities, to house and provide for the needs of any such aliens. Such a
facility may be located at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base or any other appropriate location.
(ii) The Secretary of Homeland Security may conduct any screening of such aliens that he deems
appropriate, including screening to determine whether such aliens should be returned to their country of origin
or transit, or whether they are persons in need of protection who should not be returned without their consent.
If the Secretary of Homeland Security institutes such screening, then until a determination is made, the
Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide for the custody, care, safety, transportation, and other needs of
the aliens. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall continue to provide for the custody, care, safety,
transportation, and other needs of aliens who are determined not to be persons in need of protection until such
time as they are returned to their country of origin or transit.
(b) The Secretary of State shall provide for the custody, care, safety, transportation, and other needs of
undocumented aliens interdicted or intercepted in the Caribbean region whom the Secretary of Homeland
Security has identified as persons in need of protection. The Secretary of State shall provide for and execute a
process for resettling such persons in need of protection, as appropriate, in countries other than their country
of origin, and shall also undertake such diplomatic efforts as may be necessary to address the problem of
illegal migration of aliens in the Caribbean region and to facilitate the return of those aliens who are
determined not to be persons in need of protection.
(c)(i) The Secretary of Defense shall make available to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the
Secretary of State, for the housing and care of any undocumented aliens interdicted or intercepted in the
Caribbean region and taken into their custody, any facilities at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base that are excess to
current military needs and the provision of which does not interfere with the operation and security of the
base. The Secretary of Defense shall be responsible for providing access to such facilities and perimeter
security. The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State, respectively, shall be responsible for
reimbursement for necessary supporting utilities.
[Release Point 118-106]
(ii) In the event of a mass migration in the Caribbean region, the Secretary of Defense shall provide support
to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State in carrying out the duties described in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section regarding the custody, care, safety, transportation, and other needs of the
aliens, and shall assume primary responsibility for these duties on a nonreimbursable basis as necessary to
contain the threat to national security posed by the migration. The Secretary of Defense shall also provide
support to the Coast Guard in carrying out the duties described in Executive Order 12807 of May 24, 1992 [set

EX. ORD. NO. 13940. ALIGNING FEDERAL CONTRACTING AND HIRING PRACTICES WITH
THE INTERESTS OF AMERICAN WORKERS
Ex. Ord. No. 13940, Aug. 3, 2020, 85 F.R. 47879, provided:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to create opportunities for United States
workers to compete for jobs, including jobs created through Federal contracts. These opportunities,
particularly in regions where the Federal Government remains the largest employer, are especially critical
during the economic dislocation caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID–19) pandemic. When
employers trade American jobs for temporary foreign labor, for example, it reduces opportunities for United
[Release Point 118-106]
States workers in a manner inconsistent with the role guest-worker programs are meant to play in the Nation's
economy.
SEC. 2. Review of Contracting and Hiring Practices. (a) The head of each executive department and
agency (agency) that enters into contracts shall review, to the extent practicable, performance of contracts
(including subcontracts) awarded by the agency in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 to assess:
(i) whether contractors (including subcontractors) used temporary foreign labor for contracts performed in
the United States, and, if so, the nature of the work performed by temporary foreign labor on such contracts;
whether opportunities for United States workers were affected by such hiring; and any potential effects on the
national security caused by such hiring; and
(ii) whether contractors (including subcontractors) performed in foreign countries services previously
performed in the United States, and, if so, whether opportunities for United States workers were affected by
such offshoring; whether affected United States workers were eligible for assistance under the Trade
Adjustment Assistance program authorized by the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2101 et seq.]; and any
potential effects on the national security caused by such offshoring.
(b) The head of each agency that enters into contracts shall assess any negative impact of contractors' and
subcontractors' temporary foreign labor hiring practices or offshoring practices on the economy and efficiency
of Federal procurement and on the national security, and propose action, if necessary and as appropriate and
consistent with applicable law, to improve the economy and efficiency of Federal procurement and protect the
national security.
(c) The head of each agency shall, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Personnel
Management, review the employment policies of the agency to assess the agency's compliance with Executive
Order 11935 of September 2, 1976 (Citizenship Requirements for Federal Employment) [41 F.R. 37301,
amending the Civil Service Rules], and section 704 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Public Law
116–93 [5 U.S.C. 3101 note].
(d) Within 120 days of the date of this order [Aug. 3, 2020], the head of each agency shall submit a report
to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget summarizing the results of the reviews required by
subsections (a) through (c) of this section; recommending, if necessary, corrective actions that may be taken
by the agency and timeframes to implement such actions; and proposing any Presidential actions that may be
appropriate.
SEC. 3. Measures to Prevent Adverse Effects on United States Workers. Within 45 days of the date of this
order, the Secretaries of Labor and Homeland Security shall take action, as appropriate and consistent with
applicable law, to protect United States workers from any adverse effects on wages and working conditions
caused by the employment of H-1B visa holders at job sites (including third-party job sites), including
measures to ensure that all employers of H–1B visa holders, including secondary employers, adhere to the
requirements of section 212(n)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(1)).
SEC. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary,
administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of
appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural,
enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its
officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY UNDER SECTIONS 1182(F) AND 1185(A)(1) OF THIS TITLE
Memorandum of President of the United States, Sept. 24, 1999, 64 F.R. 55809, provided:
Memorandum for the Attorney General
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
including sections 212(f) and 215(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)
and 1185(a)(1)), and in light of Proclamation 4865 of September 29, 1981 [set out above], I hereby delegate to
the Attorney General the authority to:
(a) Maintain custody, at any location she deems appropriate, and conduct any screening she deems
appropriate in her unreviewable discretion, of any undocumented person she has reason to believe is

December 31, 2000; and
(b) Undertake any other appropriate actions with respect to such aliens permitted by law.
[Release Point 118-106]
With respect to the functions delegated by this order, all actions taken after April 16, 1999, for or on behalf
of the President that would have been valid if taken pursuant to this memorandum are ratified.
This memorandum is not intended to create, and should not be construed to create, any right or benefit,
substantive or procedural, legally enforceable by any party against the United States, its agencies or
instrumentalities, officers, employees, or any other person, or to require any procedures to determine whether
a person is a refugee.
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

The Attorney General, in consultation with the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies,
shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out subparagraph (A).
(2) Actions to compel reimbursement
(A) In case of nonresponse

§1184. Admission of nonimmigrants
(a) Regulations
(1) The admission to the United States of any alien as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and
under such conditions as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe, including when he
deems necessary the giving of a bond with sufficient surety in such sum and containing such
conditions as the Attorney General shall prescribe, to insure that at the expiration of such time or
upon failure to maintain the status under which he was admitted, or to maintain any status
subsequently acquired under section 1258 of this title, such alien will depart from the United States.
No alien admitted to Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands without a visa
pursuant to section 1182(l) of this title may be authorized to enter or stay in the United States other
than in Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or to remain in Guam or the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands for a period exceeding 45 days from date of
admission to Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. No alien admitted to the
United States without a visa pursuant to section 1187 of this title may be authorized to remain in the
United States as a nonimmigrant visitor for a period exceeding 90 days from the date of admission.
(2)(A) The period of authorized status as a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(O) of
this title shall be for such period as the Attorney General may specify in order to provide for the
event (or events) for which the nonimmigrant is admitted.
(B) The period of authorized status as a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(P) of this
title shall be for such period as the Attorney General may specify in order to provide for the
competition, event, or performance for which the nonimmigrant is admitted. In the case of
nonimmigrants admitted as individual athletes under section 1101(a)(15)(P) of this title, the period of
authorized status may be for an initial period (not to exceed 5 years) during which the nonimmigrant
will perform as an athlete and such period may be extended by the Attorney General for an
additional period of up to 5 years.
(b) Presumption of status; written waiver
Every alien (other than a nonimmigrant described in subparagraph (L) or (V) of section
1101(a)(15) of this title, and other than a nonimmigrant described in any provision of section
1101(a)(15)(H)(i) of this title except subclause (b1) of such section) shall be presumed to be an
immigrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of application for
a visa, and the immigration officers, at the time of application for admission, that he is entitled to a
nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15) of this title. An alien who is an officer or employee
of any foreign government or of any international organization entitled to enjoy privileges,
exemptions, and immunities under the International Organizations Immunities Act [22 U.S.C. 288 et
seq.], or an alien who is the attendant, servant, employee, or member of the immediate family of any
such alien shall not be entitled to apply for or receive an immigrant visa, or to enter the United States
as an immigrant unless he executes a written waiver in the same form and substance as is prescribed
by section 1257(b) of this title.
[Release Point 118-106]
(c) Petition of importing employer
(1) The question of importing any alien as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (H), (L), (O), or
(P)(i) of section 1101(a)(15) of this title (excluding nonimmigrants under section
1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title) in any specific case or specific cases shall be determined by the
Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, upon petition of
the importing employer. Such petition, shall be made and approved before the visa is granted. The
petition shall be in such form and contain such information as the Attorney General shall prescribe.
The approval of such a petition shall not, of itself, be construed as establishing that the alien is a
nonimmigrant. For purposes of this subsection with respect to nonimmigrants described in section
1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title, the term "appropriate agencies of Government" means the
Department of Labor and includes the Department of Agriculture. The provisions of section 1188 of
this title shall apply to the question of importing any alien as a nonimmigrant under section
1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title.
(2)(A) The Attorney General shall provide for a procedure under which an importing employer
which meets requirements established by the Attorney General may file a blanket petition to import
aliens as nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title instead of filing individual
petitions under paragraph (1) to import such aliens. Such procedure shall permit the expedited
processing of visas for admission of aliens covered under such a petition.
(B) For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title, an alien is considered to be serving in a
capacity involving specialized knowledge with respect to a company if the alien has a special
knowledge of the company product and its application in international markets or has an advanced
level of knowledge of processes and procedures of the company.
(C) The Attorney General shall provide a process for reviewing and acting upon petitions under
this subsection with respect to nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title within
30 days after the date a completed petition has been filed.
(D) The period of authorized admission for—
(i) a nonimmigrant admitted to render services in a managerial or executive capacity under
section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title shall not exceed 7 years, or
(ii) a nonimmigrant admitted to render services in a capacity that involves specialized
knowledge under section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title shall not exceed 5 years.
(E) In the case of an alien spouse admitted under section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title, who is
accompanying or following to join a principal alien admitted under such section, the Attorney
General shall authorize the alien spouse to engage in employment in the United States and provide
the spouse with an "employment authorized" endorsement or other appropriate work permit.
(F) An alien who will serve in a capacity involving specialized knowledge with respect to an
employer for purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title and will be stationed primarily at the
worksite of an employer other than the petitioning employer or its affiliate, subsidiary, or parent shall
not be eligible for classification under section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title if—
(i) the alien will be controlled and supervised principally by such unaffiliated employer; or
(ii) the placement of the alien at the worksite of the unaffiliated employer is essentially an
arrangement to provide labor for hire for the unaffiliated employer, rather than a placement in
connection with the provision of a product or service for which specialized knowledge specific to
the petitioning employer is necessary.
(3) The Attorney General shall approve a petition—
(A) with respect to a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(O)(i) of this title only after
consultation in accordance with paragraph (6) or, with respect to aliens seeking entry for a motion
picture or television production, after consultation with the appropriate union representing the
alien's occupational peers and a management organization in the area of the alien's ability, or
(B) with respect to a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(O)(ii) of this title after
consultation in accordance with paragraph (6) or, in the case of such an alien seeking entry for a
motion picture or television production, after consultation with such a labor organization and a
[Release Point 118-106]
management organization in the area of the alien's ability.
In the case of an alien seeking entry for a motion picture or television production, (i) any opinion
under the previous sentence shall only be advisory, (ii) any such opinion that recommends denial
must be in writing, (iii) in making the decision the Attorney General shall consider the exigencies
and scheduling of the production, and (iv) the Attorney General shall append to the decision any
such opinion. The Attorney General shall provide by regulation for the waiver of the consultation
requirement under subparagraph (A) in the case of aliens who have been admitted as nonimmigrants
under section 1101(a)(15)(O)(i) of this title because of extraordinary ability in the arts and who seek
readmission to perform similar services within 2 years after the date of a consultation under such
subparagraph. Not later than 5 days after the date such a waiver is provided, the Attorney General
shall forward a copy of the petition and all supporting documentation to the national office of an
appropriate labor organization.
(4)(A) For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(P)(i)(a) of this title, an alien is described in this
subparagraph if the alien—
(i)(I) performs as an athlete, individually or as part of a group or team, at an internationally

(III) performs as an athlete, or as a coach, as part of a team or franchise that is located in the
United States and a member of a foreign league or association of 15 or more amateur sports teams,
if—

in the relevant foreign country;
(bb) participation in such league or association renders players ineligible, whether on a
temporary or permanent basis, to earn a scholarship in, or participate in, that sport at a college
or university in the United States under the rules of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association; and
(cc) a significant number of the individuals who play in such league or association are drafted
by a major sports league or a minor league affiliate of such a sports league; or
(IV) is a professional athlete or amateur athlete who performs individually or as part of a group
in a theatrical ice skating production; and
(ii) seeks to enter the United States temporarily and solely for the purpose of performing—
(I) as such an athlete with respect to a specific athletic competition; or
(II) in the case of an individual described in clause (i)(IV), in a specific theatrical ice skating
production or tour.
(B)(i) For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(P)(i)(b) of this title, an alien is described in this
subparagraph if the alien—
(I) performs with or is an integral and essential part of the performance of an entertainment
group that has (except as provided in clause (ii)) been recognized internationally as being
outstanding in the discipline for a sustained and substantial period of time,
(II) in the case of a performer or entertainer, except as provided in clause (iii), has had a
sustained and substantial relationship with that group (ordinarily for at least one year) and
provides functions integral to the performance of the group, and
(III) seeks to enter the United States temporarily and solely for the purpose of performing as
such a performer or entertainer or as an integral and essential part of a performance.
(ii) In the case of an entertainment group that is recognized nationally as being outstanding in its
discipline for a sustained and substantial period of time, the Attorney General may, in consideration
of special circumstances, waive the international recognition requirement of clause (i)(I).
(iii)(I) The one-year relationship requirement of clause (i)(II) shall not apply to 25 percent of the
performers and entertainers in a group.
[Release Point 118-106]
(II) The Attorney General may waive such one-year relationship requirement for an alien who
because of illness or unanticipated and exigent circumstances replaces an essential member of the
group and for an alien who augments the group by performing a critical role.
(iv) The requirements of subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) shall not apply to alien circus
personnel who perform as part of a circus or circus group or who constitute an integral and essential
part of the performance of such circus or circus group, but only if such personnel are entering the
United States to join a circus that has been recognized nationally as outstanding for a sustained and
substantial period of time or as part of such a circus.
(C) A person may petition the Attorney General for classification of an alien as a nonimmigrant
under section 1101(a)(15)(P) of this title.

nonimmigrants described in clause (i) or (iii) of section 1101(a)(15)(P) of this title only after

against the numerical limitations of paragraph (1) is found to have been issued such visa or otherwise
provided such status by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact and such visa or
nonimmigrant status is revoked, then one number shall be restored to the total number of aliens who
may be issued visas or otherwise provided such status under the numerical limitations of paragraph

in paragraph (5).
(7) Any alien who has already been counted, within the 6 years prior to the approval of a petition
described in subsection (c), toward the numerical limitations of paragraph (1)(A) shall not again be
counted toward those limitations unless the alien would be eligible for a full 6 years of authorized
[Release Point 118-106]
admission at the time the petition is filed. Where multiple petitions are approved for 1 alien, that
alien shall be counted only once.
(8)(A) The agreements referred to in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title are—

(iv) The annual numerical limitation described in paragraph (1)(A) is reduced by the amount of the
annual numerical limitations established under clause (i). However, if a numerical limitation
established under clause (i) has not been exhausted at the end of a given fiscal year, the Secretary of
Homeland Security shall adjust upwards the numerical limitation in paragraph (1)(A) for that fiscal
year by the amount remaining in the numerical limitation under clause (i). Visas under section
1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title may be issued pursuant to such adjustment within the first 45 days
of the next fiscal year to aliens who had applied for such visas during the fiscal year for which the

numerical limitation of paragraph (1)(B) during fiscal year 2013, 2014, or 2015 shall not again be

(h) Intention to abandon foreign residence
The fact that an alien is the beneficiary of an application for a preference status filed under section

constitute evidence of an intention to abandon a foreign residence for purposes of obtaining a visa as
a nonimmigrant described in subparagraph (H)(i)(b) or (c), (L), or (V) of section 1101(a)(15) of this
title or otherwise obtaining or maintaining the status of a nonimmigrant described in such

(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter except section 1182(t)(1) of this title, and
subject to regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Homeland Security, an alien who seeks to
enter the United States under and pursuant to the provisions of an agreement listed in subsection
(g)(8)(A), and the spouse and children of such an alien if accompanying or following to join the
alien, may be denied admission as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (E), (L), or (H)(i)(b1) of
section 1101(a)(15) of this title if there is in progress a labor dispute in the occupational
classification at the place or intended place of employment, unless such alien establishes, pursuant to
regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Homeland Security after consultation with the Secretary
of Labor, that the alien's entry will not affect adversely the settlement of the labor dispute or the
employment of any person who is involved in the labor dispute. Notice of a determination under this
paragraph shall be given as may be required by such agreement.
(k) Numerical limitations; period of admission; conditions for admission and stay; annual
report
(1) The number of aliens who may be provided a visa as nonimmigrants under section
1101(a)(15)(S)(i) of this title in any fiscal year may not exceed 200. The number of aliens who may
be provided a visa as nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(S)(ii) of this title in any fiscal year
may not exceed 50.
(2) The period of admission of an alien as such a nonimmigrant may not exceed 3 years. Such
period may not be extended by the Attorney General.
(3) As a condition for the admission, and continued stay in lawful status, of such a nonimmigrant,
the nonimmigrant—
(A) shall report not less often than quarterly to the Attorney General such information
concerning the alien's whereabouts and activities as the Attorney General may require;
(B) may not be convicted of any criminal offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of 1
year or more after the date of such admission;
(C) must have executed a form that waives the nonimmigrant's right to contest, other than on the
basis of an application for withholding of removal, any action for removal of the alien instituted
before the alien obtains lawful permanent resident status; and
(D) shall abide by any other condition, limitation, or restriction imposed by the Attorney
General.
(4) The Attorney General shall submit a report annually to the Committee on the Judiciary of the
House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate concerning—
(A) the number of such nonimmigrants admitted;
(B) the number of successful criminal prosecutions or investigations resulting from cooperation
of such aliens;

(1) In the case of a request by an interested State agency, or by an interested Federal agency, for a
waiver of the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 1182(e) of this title on behalf of an
alien described in clause (iii) of such section, the Attorney General shall not grant such waiver
unless—
(A) in the case of an alien who is otherwise contractually obligated to return to a foreign
country, the government of such country furnishes the Director of the United States Information
Agency with a statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver;
[Release Point 118-106]
(B) in the case of a request by an interested State agency, the grant of such waiver would not
cause the number of waivers allotted for that State for that fiscal year to exceed 30;
(C) in the case of a request by an interested Federal agency or by an interested State agency—
(i) the alien demonstrates a bona fide offer of full-time employment at a health facility or
health care organization, which employment has been determined by the Attorney General to be
in the public interest; and
(ii) the alien agrees to begin employment with the health facility or health care organization
within 90 days of receiving such waiver, and agrees to continue to work for a total of not less
than 3 years (unless the Attorney General determines that extenuating circumstances exist, such
as closure of the facility or hardship to the alien, which would justify a lesser period of
employment at such health facility or health care organization, in which case the alien must
demonstrate another bona fide offer of employment at a health facility or health care
organization for the remainder of such 3-year period); and
(D) in the case of a request by an interested Federal agency (other than a request by an
interested Federal agency to employ the alien full-time in medical research or training) or by an
interested State agency, the alien agrees to practice primary care or specialty medicine in
accordance with paragraph (2) for a total of not less than 3 years only in the geographic area or
areas which are designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as having a shortage of
health care professionals, except that—
(i) in the case of a request by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the alien shall not be
required to practice medicine in a geographic area designated by the Secretary;
(ii) in the case of a request by an interested State agency, the head of such State agency
determines that the alien is to practice medicine under such agreement in a facility that serves
patients who reside in one or more geographic areas so designated by the Secretary of Health
and Human Services (without regard to whether such facility is located within such a designated
geographic area), and the grant of such waiver would not cause the number of the waivers
granted on behalf of aliens for such State for a fiscal year (within the limitation in subparagraph
(B)) in accordance with the conditions of this clause to exceed 10; and
(iii) in the case of a request by an interested Federal agency or by an interested State agency
for a waiver for an alien who agrees to practice specialty medicine in a facility located in a
geographic area so designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the request shall
demonstrate, based on criteria established by such agency, that there is a shortage of health care
professionals able to provide services in the appropriate medical specialty to the patients who
will be served by the alien.
(2)(A) Notwithstanding section 1258(a)(2) of this title, the Attorney General may change the
status of an alien who qualifies under this subsection and section 1182(e) of this title to that of an
alien described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title. The numerical limitations contained in
subsection (g)(1)(A) shall not apply to any alien whose status is changed under the preceding
sentence, if the alien obtained a waiver of the 2-year foreign residence requirement upon a request by
an interested Federal agency or an interested State agency.
(B) No person who has obtained a change of status under subparagraph (A) and who has failed to
fulfill the terms of the contract with the health facility or health care organization named in the
waiver application shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, for permanent residence, or for
any other change of nonimmigrant status, until it is established that such person has resided and been
physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least 2
years following departure from the United States.
(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the 2-year foreign residence
requirement under section 1182(e) of this title shall apply with respect to an alien described in clause
(iii) of such section, who has not otherwise been accorded status under section 1101(a)(27)(H) of this
title, if—
(A) at any time the alien ceases to comply with any agreement entered into under subparagraph
[Release Point 118-106]
(C) or (D) of paragraph (1); or
(B) the alien's employment ceases to benefit the public interest at any time during the 3-year
period described in paragraph (1)(C).
(m) Nonimmigrant elementary and secondary school students
(1) An alien may not be accorded status as a nonimmigrant under clause (i) or (iii) of section
1101(a)(15)(F) of this title in order to pursue a course of study—
(A) at a public elementary school or in a publicly funded adult education program; or
(B) at a public secondary school unless—
(i) the aggregate period of such status at such a school does not exceed 12 months with
respect to any alien, and (ii) the alien demonstrates that the alien has reimbursed the local
educational agency that administers the school for the full, unsubsidized per capita cost of
providing education at such school for the period of the alien's attendance.
(2) An alien who obtains the status of a nonimmigrant under clause (i) or (iii) of section
1101(a)(15)(F) of this title in order to pursue a course of study at a private elementary or secondary
school or in a language training program that is not publicly funded shall be considered to have
violated such status, and the alien's visa under section 1101(a)(15)(F) of this title shall be void, if the
alien terminates or abandons such course of study at such a school and undertakes a course of study
at a public elementary school, in a publicly funded adult education program, in a publicly funded
adult education language training program, or at a public secondary school (unless the requirements
of paragraph (1)(B) are met).
(n) Increased portability of H–1B status
(1) A nonimmigrant alien described in paragraph (2) who was previously issued a visa or
otherwise provided nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title is authorized
to accept new employment upon the filing by the prospective employer of a new petition on behalf of
such nonimmigrant as provided under subsection (a). Employment authorization shall continue for
such alien until the new petition is adjudicated. If the new petition is denied, such authorization shall
cease.
(2) A nonimmigrant alien described in this paragraph is a nonimmigrant alien—
(A) who has been lawfully admitted into the United States;
(B) on whose behalf an employer has filed a nonfrivolous petition for new employment before
the date of expiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General; and
(C) who, subsequent to such lawful admission, has not been employed without authorization in
the United States before the filing of such petition.
(o) Nonimmigrants guilty of trafficking in persons
(1) No alien shall be eligible for admission to the United States under section 1101(a)(15)(T) of

(2) The total number of aliens who may be issued visas or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status
during any fiscal year under section 1101(a)(15)(T) of this title may not exceed 5,000.

spouses, sons, daughters, siblings, or parents of such aliens.
(4) An unmarried alien who seeks to accompany, or follow to join, a parent granted status under
section 1101(a)(15)(T)(i) of this title, and who was under 21 years of age on the date on which such
parent applied for such status, shall continue to be classified as a child for purposes of section
1101(a)(15)(T)(ii) of this title, if the alien attains 21 years of age after such parent's application was
filed but while it was pending.
(5) An alien described in clause (i) of section 1101(a)(15)(T) of this title shall continue to be
treated as an alien described in clause (ii)(I) of such section if the alien attains 21 years of age after
the alien's application for status under such clause (i) is filed but while it is pending.
(6) In making a determination under section 1101(a)(15)(T)(i)(III)(aa) with respect to an alien,
[Release Point 118-106]
statements from State and local law enforcement officials that the alien has complied with any
reasonable request for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of crimes such as kidnapping,
rape, slavery, or other forced labor offenses, where severe forms of trafficking in persons (as defined
in section 7102 of title 22) appear to have been involved, shall be considered.
(7)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an alien who is issued a visa or otherwise provided
nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15)(T) of this title may be granted such status for a
period of not more than 4 years.
(B) An alien who is issued a visa or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status under section
1101(a)(15)(T) of this title may extend the period of such status beyond the period described in
subparagraph (A) if—
(i) a Federal, State, or local law enforcement official, prosecutor, judge, or other authority
investigating or prosecuting activity relating to human trafficking or certifies that the presence of
the alien in the United States is necessary to assist in the investigation or prosecution of such
activity;
(ii) the alien is eligible for relief under section 1255(l) of this title and is unable to obtain such
relief because regulations have not been issued to implement such section; or
(iii) the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that an extension of the period of such
nonimmigrant status is warranted due to exceptional circumstances.
(C) Nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15)(T) of this title shall be extended during the
pendency of an application for adjustment of status under section 1255(l) of this title.
(p) Requirements applicable to section 1101(a)(15)(U) visas
(1) Petitioning procedures for section 1101(a)(15)(U) visas
The petition filed by an alien under section 1101(a)(15)(U)(i) of this title shall contain a
certification from a Federal, State, or local law enforcement official, prosecutor, judge, or other
Federal, State, or local authority investigating criminal activity described in section
1101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of this title. This certification may also be provided by an official of the
Service whose ability to provide such certification is not limited to information concerning

nonimmigrant status shall be extended beyond the 4-year period authorized under this section if
the alien is eligible for relief under section 1255(m) of this title and is unable to obtain such relief
because regulations have not been issued to implement such section and shall be extended during
the pendency of an application for adjustment of status under section 1255(m) of this title. The

(3) The status of an alien physically present in the United States may be adjusted by the Attorney
[Release Point 118-106]

General may prescribe, to that of a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(V) of this title, if the
alien—
(A) applies for such adjustment;
(B) satisfies the requirements of such section; and
(C) is eligible to be admitted to the United States, except in determining such admissibility, the
grounds for inadmissibility specified in paragraphs (6)(A), (7), and (9)(B) of section 1182(a) of

information on any criminal convictions of the petitioner for any specified crime described in

petitioner related to any specified crime described in subsection 3 (5)(B)(i).

the foreign state in which the marriage was concluded.
(3) In the case of a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(K)(ii) of this title, and any

practices for protection of personal identification documents: Provided, That the National Institute of
Standards and Technology shall also assist the Departments of Homeland Security and State to
incorporate into the architecture of the card the best available practices to prevent the unauthorized use
of information on the card: Provided further, That to facilitate efficient cross-border travel, the
Departments of Homeland Security and State shall, to the maximum extent possible, develop an
architecture that is compatible with information technology systems and infrastructure used by United
States Customs and Border Protection;
"(ii) the technology to be used by the United States for the passport card, and any subsequent
change to that technology, has been shared with the governments of Canada and Mexico;

"(v) the necessary technological infrastructure to process the passport cards has been

"(viii) the signing of a memorandum of agreement to initiate a pilot program with not less
than one State to determine if an enhanced driver's license, which is machine-readable and tamper

States from Canada or Mexico, and issued by such State to an individual, may permit the individual to
use the driver's license to meet the documentation requirements under subparagraph (A) for entry into
the United States from Canada or Mexico at land and sea ports of entry.
"(C) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after the initiation of the pilot program described in
subparagraph (B)(viii), the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State shall submit to the
appropriate congressional committees a report which includes—
"(i) an analysis of the impact of the pilot program on national security;

"(v) a recommendation for the type of machine-readable technology that should be used in
[Release Point 118-106]
enhanced driver's licenses, based on individual privacy considerations and the costs and feasibility of
incorporating any new technology into existing driver's licenses.

(1) shall require all United States citizens, and categories of individuals for whom documentation
requirements have previously been waived under section 212(d)(4)(B) of such Act [8 U.S.C.
1182(d)(4)(B)], to carry and produce the documentation described in paragraph (1) when traveling from

under section 212(d)(4)(B) of such Act [8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(4)(B)] to waive documentary requirements for
travel into the United States; and
"(2) the President may not exercise discretion under section 215(b) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1185(b)) to
waive documentary requirements for United States citizens departing from or entering, or attempting to
depart from or enter, the United States except—
"(A) where the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that the alternative documentation that
is the basis for the waiver of the documentary requirement is sufficient to denote identity and citizenship;
"(B) in the case of an unforeseen emergency in individual cases; or
"(C) in the case of humanitarian or national interest reasons in individual cases.
"(d) TRANSIT WITHOUT VISA PROGRAM.—The Secretary of State shall not use any authorities
granted under section 212(d)(4)(C) of such Act [8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(4)(C)] until the Secretary, in conjunction

passage areas to prevent aliens proceeding in immediate and continuous transit through the United States from
illegally entering the United States."

EDITORIAL NOTES
CODIFICATION
Section was enacted as part of the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act
of 2015, and also as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, and not as part of the Immigration and
Nationality Act which comprises this chapter.
§1188. Admission of temporary H–2A workers
(a) Conditions for approval of H–2A petitions
(1) A petition to import an alien as an H–2A worker (as defined in subsection (i)(2)) may not be
approved by the Attorney General unless the petitioner has applied to the Secretary of Labor for a
certification that—
(A) there are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, and qualified, and who will be
available at the time and place needed, to perform the labor or services involved in the petition,
and
(B) the employment of the alien in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages
and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed.
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) The Secretary of Labor may require by regulation, as a condition of issuing the certification,
the payment of a fee to recover the reasonable costs of processing applications for certification.
(b) Conditions for denial of labor certification
The Secretary of Labor may not issue a certification under subsection (a) with respect to an
employer if the conditions described in that subsection are not met or if any of the following
conditions are met:
(1) There is a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute which, under the regulations,
precludes such certification.
(2)(A) The employer during the previous two-year period employed H–2A workers and the
Secretary of Labor has determined, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the employer at
any time during that period substantially violated a material term or condition of the labor
certification with respect to the employment of domestic or nonimmigrant workers.
(B) No employer may be denied certification under subparagraph (A) for more than three years
for any violation described in such subparagraph.
(3) The employer has not provided the Secretary with satisfactory assurances that if the
employment for which the certification is sought is not covered by State workers' compensation
law, the employer will provide, at no cost to the worker, insurance covering injury and disease
arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment which will provide benefits at least
equal to those provided under the State workers' compensation law for comparable employment.
(4) The Secretary determines that the employer has not made positive recruitment efforts within
a multi-state region of traditional or expected labor supply where the Secretary finds that there are
a significant number of qualified United States workers who, if recruited, would be willing to
make themselves available for work at the time and place needed. Positive recruitment under this
paragraph is in addition to, and shall be conducted within the same time period as, the circulation
through the interstate employment service system of the employer's job offer. The obligation to
engage in positive recruitment under this paragraph shall terminate on the date the H–2A workers
depart for the employer's place of employment.
(c) Special rules for consideration of applications
The following rules shall apply in the case of the filing and consideration of an application for a
labor certification under this section:
(1) Deadline for filing applications
The Secretary of Labor may not require that the application be filed more than 45 days before
the first date the employer requires the labor or services of the H–2A worker.
(2) Notice within seven days of deficiencies
(A) The employer shall be notified in writing within seven days of the date of filing if the
application does not meet the standards (other than that described in subsection (a)(1)(A)) for
approval.
(B) If the application does not meet such standards, the notice shall include the reasons therefor
and the Secretary shall provide an opportunity for the prompt resubmission of a modified
application.
(3) Issuance of certification
(A) The Secretary of Labor shall make, not later than 30 days before the date such labor or
services are first required to be performed, the certification described in subsection (a)(1) if—
(i) the employer has complied with the criteria for certification (including criteria for the
recruitment of eligible individuals as prescribed by the Secretary), and
(ii) the employer does not actually have, or has not been provided with referrals of, qualified
eligible individuals who have indicated their availability to perform such labor or services on
the terms and conditions of a job offer which meets the requirements of the Secretary.
[Release Point 118-106]
In considering the question of whether a specific qualification is appropriate in a job offer, the
Secretary shall apply the normal and accepted qualifications required by non-H–2A-employers in
the same or comparable occupations and crops.
(B)(i) For a period of 3 years subsequent to the effective date of this section, labor certifications
shall remain effective only if, from the time the foreign worker departs for the employer's place of
employment, the employer will provide employment to any qualified United States worker who
applies to the employer until 50 percent of the period of the work contract, under which the
foreign worker who is in the job was hired, has elapsed. In addition, the employer will offer to
provide benefits, wages and working conditions required pursuant to this section and regulations.
(ii) The requirement of clause (i) shall not apply to any employer who—
(I) did not, during any calendar quarter during the preceding calendar year, use more than 500
man-days of agricultural labor, as defined in section 203(u) of title 29,
(II) is not a member of an association which has petitioned for certification under this section
for its members, and
(III) has not otherwise associated with other employers who are petitioning for temporary
foreign workers under this section.
(iii) Six months before the end of the 3-year period described in clause (i), the Secretary of
Labor shall consider the findings of the report mandated by section 403(a)(4)(D) of the
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 as well as other relevant materials, including
evidence of benefits to United States workers and costs to employers, addressing the advisability
of continuing a policy which requires an employer, as a condition for certification under this
section, to continue to accept qualified, eligible United States workers for employment after the
date the H–2A workers depart for work with the employer. The Secretary's review of such
findings and materials shall lead to the issuance of findings in furtherance of the Congressional
policy that aliens not be admitted under this section unless there are not sufficient workers in the
United States who are able, willing, and qualified to perform the labor or service needed and that
the employment of the aliens in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and
working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. In the absence of the
enactment of Federal legislation prior to three months before the end of the 3-year period
described in clause (i) which addresses the subject matter of this subparagraph, the Secretary shall
immediately publish the findings required by this clause, and shall promulgate, on an interim or
final basis, regulations based on his findings which shall be effective no later than three years from
the effective date of this section.
(iv) In complying with clause (i) of this subparagraph, an association shall be allowed to refer or
transfer workers among its members: Provided, That for purposes of this section an association
acting as an agent for its members shall not be considered a joint employer merely because of such
referral or transfer.
(v) United States workers referred or transferred pursuant to clause (iv) of this subparagraph
shall not be treated disparately.
(vi) An employer shall not be liable for payments under section 655.202(b)(6) of title 20, Code
of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation) with respect to an H–2A worker who is
displaced due to compliance with the requirement of this subparagraph, if the Secretary of Labor
certifies that the H–2A worker was displaced because of the employer's compliance with clause (i)
of this subparagraph.
(vii)(I) No person or entity shall willfully and knowingly withhold domestic workers prior to
the arrival of H–2A workers in order to force the hiring of domestic workers under clause (i).
(II) Upon the receipt of a complaint by an employer that a violation of subclause (I) has
occurred the Secretary shall immediately investigate. He shall within 36 hours of the receipt of the
complaint issue findings concerning the alleged violation. Where the Secretary finds that a
violation has occurred, he shall immediately suspend the application of clause (i) of this
subparagraph with respect to that certification for that date of need.
(4) Housing
[Release Point 118-106]
Employers shall furnish housing in accordance with regulations. The employer shall be
permitted at the employer's option to provide housing meeting applicable Federal standards for
temporary labor camps or to secure housing which meets the local standards for rental and/or
public accommodations or other substantially similar class of habitation: Provided, That in the
absence of applicable local standards, State standards for rental and/or public accommodations or
other substantially similar class of habitation shall be met: Provided further, That in the absence of
applicable local or State standards, Federal temporary labor camp standards shall apply: Provided
further, That the Secretary of Labor shall issue regulations which address the specific
requirements of housing for employees principally engaged in the range production of livestock:
Provided further, That when it is the prevailing practice in the area and occupation of intended
employment to provide family housing, family housing shall be provided to workers with families
who request it: And provided further, That nothing in this paragraph shall require an employer to
provide or secure housing for workers who are not entitled to it under the temporary labor
certification regulations in effect on June 1, 1986. The determination as to whether the housing
furnished by an employer for an H–2A worker meets the requirements imposed by this paragraph
must be made prior to the date specified in paragraph (3)(A) by which the Secretary of Labor is
required to make a certification described in subsection (a)(1) with respect to a petition for the
importation of such worker.
(d) Roles of agricultural associations
(1) Permitting filing by agricultural associations
A petition to import an alien as a temporary agricultural worker, and an application for a labor
certification with respect to such a worker, may be filed by an association of agricultural
producers which use agricultural services.
(2) Treatment of associations acting as employers
If an association is a joint or sole employer of temporary agricultural workers, the certifications
granted under this section to the association may be used for the certified job opportunities of any
of its producer members and such workers may be transferred among its producer members to
perform agricultural services of a temporary or seasonal nature for which the certifications were
granted.
(3) Treatment of violations
(A) Member's violation does not necessarily disqualify association or other members
If an individual producer member of a joint employer association is determined to have
committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) results in the denial of certification with respect to
the member, the denial shall apply only to that member of the association unless the Secretary
determines that the association or other member participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to
know of, the violation.
(B) Association's violation does not necessarily disqualify members
(i) If an association representing agricultural producers as a joint employer is determined to
have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) results in the denial of certification with
respect to the association, the denial shall apply only to the association and does not apply to
any individual producer member of the association unless the Secretary determines that the
member participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of, the violation.
(ii) If an association of agricultural producers certified as a sole employer is determined to
have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) results in the denial of certification with
respect to the association, no individual producer member of such association may be the
beneficiary of the services of temporary alien agricultural workers admitted under this section in
the commodity and occupation in which such aliens were employed by the association which
was denied certification during the period such denial is in force, unless such producer member
employs such aliens in the commodity and occupation in question directly or through an
association which is a joint employer of such workers with the producer member.
[Release Point 118-106]
(e) Expedited administrative appeals of certain determinations
(1) Regulations shall provide for an expedited procedure for the review of a denial of certification
under subsection (a)(1) or a revocation of such a certification or, at the applicant's request, for a de
novo administrative hearing respecting the denial or revocation.
(2) The Secretary of Labor shall expeditiously, but in no case later than 72 hours after the time a
new determination is requested, make a new determination on the request for certification in the case
of an H–2A worker if able, willing, and qualified eligible individuals are not actually available at the
time such labor or services are required and a certification was denied in whole or in part because of
the availability of qualified workers. If the employer asserts that any eligible individual who has
been referred is not able, willing, or qualified, the burden of proof is on the employer to establish that
the individual referred is not able, willing, or qualified because of employment-related reasons.
(f) Violators disqualified for 5 years
An alien may not be admitted to the United States as a temporary agricultural worker if the alien
was admitted to the United States as such a worker within the previous five-year period and the alien
during that period violated a term or condition of such previous admission.
(g) Authorization of appropriations
(1) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987,
$10,000,000 for the purposes—
(A) of recruiting domestic workers for temporary labor and services which might otherwise be
performed by nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title, and
(B) of monitoring terms and conditions under which such nonimmigrants (and domestic
workers employed by the same employers) are employed in the United States.
(2) The Secretary of Labor is authorized to take such actions, including imposing appropriate
penalties and seeking appropriate injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual
obligations, as may be necessary to assure employer compliance with terms and conditions of
employment under this section.
(3) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987,
such sums as may be necessary for the purpose of enabling the Secretary of Labor to make
determinations and certifications under this section and under section 1182(a)(5)(A)(i) of this title.
(4) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987,
such sums as may be necessary for the purposes of enabling the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out
the Secretary's duties and responsibilities under this section.
(h) Miscellaneous provisions
(1) The Attorney General shall provide for such endorsement of entry and exit documents of
nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii) of this title as may be necessary to carry out
this section and to provide notice for purposes of section 1324a of this title.
(2) The provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of section 1184 of this title and the provisions of this
section preempt any State or local law regulating admissibility of nonimmigrant workers.
(i) Definitions
For purposes of this section:
(1) The term "eligible individual" means, with respect to employment, an individual who is not
an unauthorized alien (as defined in section 1324a(h)(3) of this title) with respect to that
employment.
(2) The term "H–2A worker" means a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a)
of this title.

PART III—ISSUANCE OF ENTRY DOCUMENTS
§1201. Issuance of visas
(a) Immigrants; nonimmigrants
(1) Under the conditions hereinafter prescribed and subject to the limitations prescribed in this
chapter or regulations issued thereunder, a consular officer may issue
(A) to an immigrant who has made proper application therefor, an immigrant visa which shall
consist of the application provided for in section 1202 of this title, visaed by such consular officer,
and shall specify the foreign state, if any, to which the immigrant is charged, the immigrant's
particular status under such foreign state, the preference, immediate relative, or special immigrant
classification to which the alien is charged, the date on which the validity of the visa shall expire,
and such additional information as may be required; and
(B) to a nonimmigrant who has made proper application therefor, a nonimmigrant visa, which
shall specify the classification under section 1101(a)(15) of this title of the nonimmigrant, the
period during which the nonimmigrant visa shall be valid, and such additional information as may
be required.
(2) The Secretary of State shall provide to the Service an electronic version of the visa file of each
alien who has been issued a visa to ensure that the data in that visa file is available to immigration
[Release Point 118-106]
inspectors at the United States ports of entry before the arrival of the alien at such a port of entry.
(b) Registration; photographs; waiver of requirement
Each alien who applies for a visa shall be registered in connection with his application, and shall
furnish copies of his photograph signed by him for such use as may be by regulations required. The
requirements of this subsection may be waived in the discretion of the Secretary of State in the case
of any alien who is within that class of nonimmigrants enumerated in sections 1101(a)(15)(A), and
1101(a)(15)(G) of this title, or in the case of any alien who is granted a diplomatic visa on a
diplomatic passport or on the equivalent thereof.
(c) Period of validity; renewal or replacement
(1) Immigrant visas
An immigrant visa shall be valid for such period, not exceeding six months, as shall be by
regulations prescribed, except that any visa issued to a child lawfully adopted by a United States
citizen and spouse while such citizen is serving abroad in the United States Armed Forces, or is
employed abroad by the United States Government, or is temporarily abroad on business, shall be
valid until such time, for a period not to exceed three years, as the adoptive citizen parent returns
to the United States in due course of his service, employment, or business.
(2) Nonimmigrant visas
A nonimmigrant visa shall be valid for such periods as shall be by regulations prescribed. In
prescribing the period of validity of a nonimmigrant visa in the case of nationals of any foreign
country who are eligible for such visas, the Secretary of State shall, insofar as practicable, accord
to such nationals the same treatment upon a reciprocal basis as such foreign country accords to
nationals of the United States who are within a similar class; except that in the case of aliens who
are nationals of a foreign country and who either are granted refugee status and firmly resettled in
another foreign country or are granted permanent residence and residing in another foreign
country, the Secretary of State may prescribe the period of validity of such a visa based upon the
treatment granted by that other foreign country to alien refugees and permanent residents,
respectively, in the United States.
(3) Visa replacement
An immigrant visa may be replaced under the original number during the fiscal year in which
the original visa was issued for an immigrant who establishes to the satisfaction of the consular
officer that the immigrant—
(A) was unable to use the original immigrant visa during the period of its validity because of
reasons beyond his control and for which he was not responsible;
(B) is found by a consular officer to be eligible for an immigrant visa; and
(C) pays again the statutory fees for an application and an immigrant visa.
(4) Fee waiver
If an immigrant visa was issued, on or after March 27, 2013, for a child who has been lawfully
adopted, or who is coming to the United States to be adopted, by a United States citizen, any
statutory immigrant visa fees relating to a renewal or replacement of such visa may be waived or,
if already paid, may be refunded upon request, subject to such criteria as the Secretary of State
may prescribe, if—
(A) the immigrant child was unable to use the original immigrant visa during the period of its
validity as a direct result of extraordinary circumstances, including the denial of an exit permit;
and
(B) if such inability was attributable to factors beyond the control of the adopting parent or
parents and of the immigrant.
(d) Physical examination
Prior to the issuance of an immigrant visa to any alien, the consular officer shall require such alien
to submit to a physical and mental examination in accordance with such regulations as may be
[Release Point 118-106]
prescribed. Prior to the issuance of a nonimmigrant visa to any alien, the consular officer may
require such alien to submit to a physical or mental examination, or both, if in his opinion such
examination is necessary to ascertain whether such alien is eligible to receive a visa.
(e) Surrender of visa
Each immigrant shall surrender his immigrant visa to the immigration officer at the port of entry,
who shall endorse on the visa the date and the port of arrival, the identity of the vessel or other
means of transportation by which the immigrant arrived, and such other endorsements as may be by
regulations required.
(f) Surrender of documents
Each nonimmigrant shall present or surrender to the immigration officer at the port of entry such
documents as may be by regulation required. In the case of an alien crewman not in possession of
any individual documents other than a passport and until such time as it becomes practicable to issue
individual documents, such alien crewman may be admitted, subject to the provisions of this part, if
his name appears in the crew list of the vessel or aircraft on which he arrives and the crew list is
visaed by a consular officer, but the consular officer shall have the right to deny admission to any
alien crewman from the crew list visa.
(g) Nonissuance of visas or other documents
No visa or other documentation shall be issued to an alien if (1) it appears to the consular officer,
from statements in the application, or in the papers submitted therewith, that such alien is ineligible
to receive a visa or such other documentation under section 1182 of this title, or any other provision
of law, (2) the application fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter, or the regulations
issued thereunder, or (3) the consular officer knows or has reason to believe that such alien is
ineligible to receive a visa or such other documentation under section 1182 of this title, or any other
provision of law: Provided, That a visa or other documentation may be issued to an alien who is
within the purview of section 1182(a)(4) of this title, if such alien is otherwise entitled to receive a
visa or other documentation, upon receipt of notice by the consular officer from the Attorney
General of the giving of a bond or undertaking providing indemnity as in the case of aliens admitted
under section 1183 of this title: Provided further, That a visa may be issued to an alien defined in
section 1101(a)(15)(B) or (F) of this title, if such alien is otherwise entitled to receive a visa, upon
receipt of a notice by the consular officer from the Attorney General of the giving of a bond with
sufficient surety in such sum and containing such conditions as the consular officer shall prescribe,
to insure that at the expiration of the time for which such alien has been admitted by the Attorney
General, as provided in section 1184(a) of this title, or upon failure to maintain the status under
which he was admitted, or to maintain any status subsequently acquired under section 1258 of this
title, such alien will depart from the United States.
(h) Nonadmission upon arrival
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to entitle any alien, to whom a visa or other
documentation has been issued, to be admitted 1 the United States, if, upon arrival at a port of entry
in the United States, he is found to be inadmissible under this chapter, or any other provision of law.
The substance of this subsection shall appear upon every visa application.
(i) Revocation of visas or documents
After the issuance of a visa or other documentation to any alien, the consular officer or the
Secretary of State may at any time, in his discretion, revoke such visa or other documentation. Notice
of such revocation shall be communicated to the Attorney General, and such revocation shall
invalidate the visa or other documentation from the date of issuance: Provided, That carriers or
transportation companies, and masters, commanding officers, agents, owners, charterers, or
consignees, shall not be penalized under section 1323(b) of this title for action taken in reliance on
such visas or other documentation, unless they received due notice of such revocation prior to the
alien's embarkation. There shall be no means of judicial review (including review pursuant to section
2241 of title 28 or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title) of a
[Release Point 118-106]
revocation under this subsection, except in the context of a removal proceeding if such revocation
provides the sole ground for removal under section 1227(a)(1)(B) of this title.

this title.
§1202. Application for visas
(a) Immigrant visas
Every alien applying for an immigrant visa and for alien registration shall make application
therefor in such form and manner and at such place as shall be by regulations prescribed. In the
application the alien shall state his full and true name, and any other name which he has used or by
which he has been known; age and sex; the date and place of his birth; and such additional
information necessary to the identification of the applicant and the enforcement of the immigration
and nationality laws as may be by regulations prescribed.
(b) Other documentary evidence for immigrant visa
Every alien applying for an immigrant visa shall present a valid unexpired passport or other
suitable travel document, or document of identity and nationality, if such document is required under
the regulations issued by the Secretary of State. The immigrant shall furnish to the consular officer
with his application a copy of a certification by the appropriate police authorities stating what their
records show concerning the immigrant; a certified copy of any existing prison record, military
[Release Point 118-106]
record, and record of his birth; and a certified copy of all other records or documents concerning him
or his case which may be required by the consular officer. The copy of each document so furnished
shall be permanently attached to the application and become a part thereof. In the event that the
immigrant establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer that any document or record required
by this subsection is unobtainable, the consular officer may permit the immigrant to submit in lieu of
such document or record other satisfactory evidence of the fact to which such document or record
would, if obtainable, pertain. All immigrant visa applications shall be reviewed and adjudicated by a
consular officer.
(c) Nonimmigrant visas; nonimmigrant registration; form, manner and contents of application
Every alien applying for a nonimmigrant visa and for alien registration shall make application
therefor in such form and manner as shall be by regulations prescribed. In the application the alien
shall state his full and true name, the date and place of birth, his nationality, the purpose and length
of his intended stay in the United States; his marital status; and such additional information
necessary to the identification of the applicant, the determination of his eligibility for a
nonimmigrant visa, and the enforcement of the immigration and nationality laws as may be by
regulations prescribed. The alien shall provide complete and accurate information in response to any
request for information contained in the application. At the discretion of the Secretary of State,
application forms for the various classes of nonimmigrant admissions described in section
1101(a)(15) of this title may vary according to the class of visa being requested.
(d) Other documentary evidence for nonimmigrant visa
Every alien applying for a nonimmigrant visa and alien registration shall furnish to the consular
officer, with his application, a certified copy of such documents pertaining to him as may be by
regulations required. All nonimmigrant visa applications shall be reviewed and adjudicated by a
consular officer.
(e) Signing and verification of application
Except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations, each application for an immigrant visa shall
be signed by the applicant in the presence of the consular officer, and verified by the oath of the
applicant administered by the consular officer. The application for an immigrant visa, when visaed
by the consular officer, shall become the immigrant visa. The application for a nonimmigrant visa or
other documentation as a nonimmigrant shall be disposed of as may be by regulations prescribed.
The issuance of a nonimmigrant visa shall, except as may be otherwise by regulations prescribed, be
evidenced by a stamp, or other 1 placed in the alien's passport.
(f) Confidential nature of records
The records of the Department of State and of diplomatic and consular offices of the United States
pertaining to the issuance or refusal of visas or permits to enter the United States shall be considered
confidential and shall be used only for the formulation, amendment, administration, or enforcement
of the immigration, nationality, and other laws of the United States, except that—
(1) in the discretion of the Secretary of State certified copies of such records may be made
available to a court which certifies that the information contained in such records is needed by the
court in the interest of the ends of justice in a case pending before the court.2
(2) the Secretary of State, in the Secretary's discretion and on the basis of reciprocity, may
provide to a foreign government information in the Department of State's computerized visa
lookout database and, when necessary and appropriate, other records covered by this section
related to information in the database—
(A) with regard to individual aliens, at any time on a case-by-case basis for the purpose of
preventing, investigating, or punishing acts that would constitute a crime in the United States,
including, but not limited to, terrorism or trafficking in controlled substances, persons, or illicit
weapons; or
(B) with regard to any or all aliens in the database, pursuant to such conditions as the
Secretary of State shall establish in an agreement with the foreign government in which that
government agrees to use such information and records for the purposes described in
[Release Point 118-106]
subparagraph (A) or to deny visas to persons who would be inadmissible to the United States.
(g) Nonimmigrant visa void at conclusion of authorized period of stay
(1) In the case of an alien who has been admitted on the basis of a nonimmigrant visa and
remained in the United States beyond the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General, such
visa shall be void beginning after the conclusion of such period of stay.
(2) An alien described in paragraph (1) shall be ineligible to be readmitted to the United States as
a nonimmigrant, except—
(A) on the basis of a visa (other than the visa described in paragraph (1)) issued in a consular
office located in the country of the alien's nationality (or, if there is no office in such country, in
such other consular office as the Secretary of State shall specify); or
(B) where extraordinary circumstances are found by the Secretary of State to exist.
(h) In person interview with consular officer
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary of State shall require every
alien applying for a nonimmigrant visa—

title (referred to as the "C–3 visa" category); or

equivalent thereof;

(i) not more than 12 months after the date on which such alien's prior visa expired;
(ii) for the visa classification for which such prior visa was issued;
(iii) from the consular post located in the country of such alien's usual residence, unless
otherwise prescribed in regulations that require an applicant to apply for a visa in the country
of which such applicant is a national; and
(iv) the consular officer has no indication that such alien has not complied with the
immigration laws and regulations of the United States; or
(C) by the Secretary of State if the Secretary determines that such waiver is—
(i) in the national interest of the United States; or
(ii) necessary as a result of unusual or emergent circumstances; and
(2) notwithstanding paragraph (1), to submit to an in person interview with a consular officer if
such alien—
(A) is not a national or resident of the country in which such alien is applying for a visa;
(B) was previously refused a visa, unless such refusal was overcome or a waiver of
ineligibility has been obtained;
(C) is listed in the Consular Lookout and Support System (or successor system at the

of terrorism, except such nationals who possess nationalities of countries that are not designated
as state sponsors of terrorism;
(E) requires a security advisory opinion or other Department of State clearance, unless such
alien is—

(iv) an alien who qualifies for a diplomatic or official visa, or its equivalent; or
(F) is identified as a member of a group or sector that the Secretary of State determines—
(i) poses a substantial risk of submitting inaccurate information in order to obtain a visa;
(ii) has historically had visa applications denied at a rate that is higher than the average rate
of such denials; or
(iii) poses a security threat to the United States.

§1222. Detention of aliens for physical and mental examination
(a) Detention of aliens
For the purpose of determining whether aliens (including alien crewmen) arriving at ports of the
United States belong to any of the classes inadmissible under this chapter, by reason of being
afflicted with any of the diseases or mental or physical defects or disabilities set forth in section
1182(a) of this title, or whenever the Attorney General has received information showing that any
aliens are coming from a country or have embarked at a place where any of such diseases are
prevalent or epidemic, such aliens shall be detained by the Attorney General for a sufficient time to
enable the immigration officers and medical officers to subject such aliens to observation and an
examination sufficient to determine whether or not they belong to inadmissible classes.
(b) Physical and mental examination
The physical and mental examination of arriving aliens (including alien crewmen) shall be made
by medical officers of the United States Public Health Service, who shall conduct all medical
examinations and shall certify, for the information of the immigration officers and the immigration
judges, any physical and mental defect or disease observed by such medical officers in any such
alien. If medical officers of the United States Public Health Service are not available, civil surgeons
of not less than four years' professional experience may be employed for such service upon such
terms as may be prescribed by the Attorney General. Aliens (including alien crewmen) arriving at
ports of the United States shall be examined by at least one such medical officer or civil surgeon
under such administrative regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe, and under medical
regulations prepared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Medical officers of the United
States Public Health Service who have had special training in the diagnosis of insanity and mental
defects shall be detailed for duty or employed at such ports of entry as the Attorney General may
designate, and such medical officers shall be provided with suitable facilities for the detention and
examination of all arriving aliens who it is suspected may be inadmissible under paragraph (1) of
section 1182(a) of this title, and the services of interpreters shall be provided for such examination.
[Release Point 118-106]
Any alien certified under paragraph (1) of section 1182(a) of this title, may appeal to a board of
medical officers of the United States Public Health Service, which shall be convened by the
Secretary of Health and Human Services, and any such alien may introduce before such board one
expert medical witness at his own cost and expense.
(c) Certification of certain helpless aliens
If an examining medical officer determines that an alien arriving in the United States is
inadmissible, is helpless from sickness, mental or physical disability, or infancy, and is accompanied
by another alien whose protection or guardianship may be required, the officer may certify such fact
for purposes of applying section 1182(a)(10)(B) of this title with respect to the other alien.

§1224. Designation of ports of entry for aliens arriving by aircraft
The Attorney General is authorized (1) by regulation to designate as ports of entry for aliens
arriving by aircraft any of the ports of entry for civil aircraft designated as such in accordance with
law; (2) by regulation to provide such reasonable requirements for aircraft in civil air navigation with
respect to giving notice of intention to land in advance of landing, or notice of landing, as shall be
deemed necessary for purposes of administration and enforcement of this chapter; and (3) by
regulation to provide for the application to civil air navigation of the provisions of this chapter where
not expressly so provided in this chapter to such extent and upon such conditions as he deems
necessary. Any person who violates any regulation made under this section shall be subject to a civil
penalty of $2,000 which may be remitted or mitigated by the Attorney General in accordance with
such proceedings as the Attorney General shall by regulation prescribe. In case the violation is by the
owner or person in command of the aircraft, the penalty shall be a lien upon the aircraft, and such
aircraft may be libeled therefore in the appropriate United States court. The determination by the
Attorney General and remission or mitigation of the civil penalty shall be final. In case the violation
[Release Point 118-106]
is by the owner or person in command of the aircraft, the penalty shall be a lien upon the aircraft and
may be collected by proceedings in rem which shall conform as nearly as may be to civil suits in
admiralty. The Supreme Court of the United States, and under its direction other courts of the United
States, are authorized to prescribe rules regulating such proceedings against aircraft in any particular
not otherwise provided by law. Any aircraft made subject to a lien by this section may be summarily
seized by, and placed in the custody of such persons as the Attorney General may by regulation
prescribe. The aircraft may be released from such custody upon deposit of such amount not
exceeding $2,000 as the Attorney General may prescribe, or of a bond in such sum and with such
sureties as the Attorney General may prescribe, conditioned upon the payment of the penalty which

§1225. Inspection by immigration officers; expedited removal of inadmissible
arriving aliens; referral for hearing
[Release Point 118-106]
(a) Inspection
(1) Aliens treated as applicants for admission
An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or who arrives in the United
States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the
United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters) shall be
deemed for purposes of this chapter an applicant for admission.
(2) Stowaways
An arriving alien who is a stowaway is not eligible to apply for admission or to be admitted and
shall be ordered removed upon inspection by an immigration officer. Upon such inspection if the
alien indicates an intention to apply for asylum under section 1158 of this title or a fear of
persecution, the officer shall refer the alien for an interview under subsection (b)(1)(B). A
stowaway may apply for asylum only if the stowaway is found to have a credible fear of
persecution under subsection (b)(1)(B). In no case may a stowaway be considered an applicant for
admission or eligible for a hearing under section 1229a of this title.
(3) Inspection
All aliens (including alien crewmen) who are applicants for admission or otherwise seeking
admission or readmission to or transit through the United States shall be inspected by immigration
officers.
(4) Withdrawal of application for admission
An alien applying for admission may, in the discretion of the Attorney General and at any time,
be permitted to withdraw the application for admission and depart immediately from the United
States.
(5) Statements
An applicant for admission may be required to state under oath any information sought by an
immigration officer regarding the purposes and intentions of the applicant in seeking admission to
the United States, including the applicant's intended length of stay and whether the applicant
intends to remain permanently or become a United States citizen, and whether the applicant is
inadmissible.
(b) Inspection of applicants for admission
(1) Inspection of aliens arriving in the United States and certain other aliens who have not
been admitted or paroled
(A) Screening
(i) In general
If an immigration officer determines that an alien (other than an alien described in
subparagraph (F)) who is arriving in the United States or is described in clause (iii) is
inadmissible under section 1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) of this title, the officer shall order the
alien removed from the United States without further hearing or review unless the alien
indicates either an intention to apply for asylum under section 1158 of this title or a fear of
persecution.
(ii) Claims for asylum
If an immigration officer determines that an alien (other than an alien described in
subparagraph (F)) who is arriving in the United States or is described in clause (iii) is
inadmissible under section 1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) of this title and the alien indicates
either an intention to apply for asylum under section 1158 of this title or a fear of persecution,
the officer shall refer the alien for an interview by an asylum officer under subparagraph (B).
(iii) Application to certain other aliens
(I) In general
[Release Point 118-106]
The Attorney General may apply clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph to any or all
aliens described in subclause (II) as designated by the Attorney General. Such designation
shall be in the sole and unreviewable discretion of the Attorney General and may be
modified at any time.
(II) Aliens described
An alien described in this clause is an alien who is not described in subparagraph (F),
who has not been admitted or paroled into the United States, and who has not affirmatively
shown, to the satisfaction of an immigration officer, that the alien has been physically
present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to the
date of the determination of inadmissibility under this subparagraph.
(B) Asylum interviews
(i) Conduct by asylum officers
An asylum officer shall conduct interviews of aliens referred under subparagraph (A)(ii),
either at a port of entry or at such other place designated by the Attorney General.
(ii) Referral of certain aliens
If the officer determines at the time of the interview that an alien has a credible fear of
persecution (within the meaning of clause (v)), the alien shall be detained for further
consideration of the application for asylum.
(iii) Removal without further review if no credible fear of persecution
(I) In general
Subject to subclause (III), if the officer determines that an alien does not have a credible
fear of persecution, the officer shall order the alien removed from the United States
without further hearing or review.
(II) Record of determination
The officer shall prepare a written record of a determination under subclause (I). Such
record shall include a summary of the material facts as stated by the applicant, such
additional facts (if any) relied upon by the officer, and the officer's analysis of why, in the
light of such facts, the alien has not established a credible fear of persecution. A copy of
the officer's interview notes shall be attached to the written summary.
(III) Review of determination
The Attorney General shall provide by regulation and upon the alien's request for
prompt review by an immigration judge of a determination under subclause (I) that the
alien does not have a credible fear of persecution. Such review shall include an opportunity
for the alien to be heard and questioned by the immigration judge, either in person or by
telephonic or video connection. Review shall be concluded as expeditiously as possible, to
the maximum extent practicable within 24 hours, but in no case later than 7 days after the
date of the determination under subclause (I).
(IV) Mandatory detention
Any alien subject to the procedures under this clause shall be detained pending a final
determination of credible fear of persecution and, if found not to have such a fear, until
removed.
(iv) Information about interviews
The Attorney General shall provide information concerning the asylum interview described
in this subparagraph to aliens who may be eligible. An alien who is eligible for such
interview may consult with a person or persons of the alien's choosing prior to the interview
or any review thereof, according to regulations prescribed by the Attorney General. Such
consultation shall be at no expense to the Government and shall not unreasonably delay the
process.
[Release Point 118-106]
(v) "Credible fear of persecution" defined
For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "credible fear of persecution" means that there
is a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the
alien in support of the alien's claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the
alien could establish eligibility for asylum under section 1158 of this title.
(C) Limitation on administrative review
Except as provided in subparagraph (B)(iii)(III), a removal order entered in accordance with
subparagraph (A)(i) or (B)(iii)(I) is not subject to administrative appeal, except that the
Attorney General shall provide by regulation for prompt review of such an order under
subparagraph (A)(i) against an alien who claims under oath, or as permitted under penalty of
perjury under section 1746 of title 28, after having been warned of the penalties for falsely
making such claim under such conditions, to have been lawfully admitted for permanent
residence, to have been admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or to have been
granted asylum under section 1158 of this title.
(D) Limit on collateral attacks
In any action brought against an alien under section 1325(a) of this title or section 1326 of
this title, the court shall not have jurisdiction to hear any claim attacking the validity of an order
of removal entered under subparagraph (A)(i) or (B)(iii).
(E) "Asylum officer" defined
As used in this paragraph, the term "asylum officer" means an immigration officer who—
(i) has had professional training in country conditions, asylum law, and interview
techniques comparable to that provided to full-time adjudicators of applications under section
1158 of this title, and
(ii) is supervised by an officer who meets the condition described in clause (i) and has had
substantial experience adjudicating asylum applications.
(F) Exception
Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an alien who is a native or citizen of a country in the
Western Hemisphere with whose government the United States does not have full diplomatic
relations and who arrives by aircraft at a port of entry.
(G) Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize or require any person described in
section 1158(e) of this title to be permitted to apply for asylum under section 1158 of this title at
any time before January 1, 2014.
(2) Inspection of other aliens
(A) In general
Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), in the case of an alien who is an applicant for
admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is
not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a
proceeding under section 1229a of this title.
(B) Exception
Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an alien—
(i) who is a crewman,
(ii) to whom paragraph (1) applies, or
(iii) who is a stowaway.
(C) Treatment of aliens arriving from contiguous territory
In the case of an alien described in subparagraph (A) who is arriving on land (whether or not
at a designated port of arrival) from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the
Attorney General may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section
[Release Point 118-106]
1229a of this title.
(3) Challenge of decision
The decision of the examining immigration officer, if favorable to the admission of any alien,
shall be subject to challenge by any other immigration officer and such challenge shall operate to
take the alien whose privilege to be admitted is so challenged, before an immigration judge for a
proceeding under section 1229a of this title.
(c) Removal of aliens inadmissible on security and related grounds
(1) Removal without further hearing
If an immigration officer or an immigration judge suspects that an arriving alien may be
inadmissible under subparagraph (A) (other than clause (ii)), (B), or (C) of section 1182(a)(3) of
this title, the officer or judge shall—
(A) order the alien removed, subject to review under paragraph (2);
(B) report the order of removal to the Attorney General; and
(C) not conduct any further inquiry or hearing until ordered by the Attorney General.
(2) Review of order
(A) The Attorney General shall review orders issued under paragraph (1).
(B) If the Attorney General—
(i) is satisfied on the basis of confidential information that the alien is inadmissible under
subparagraph (A) (other than clause (ii)), (B), or (C) of section 1182(a)(3) of this title, and
(ii) after consulting with appropriate security agencies of the United States Government,
concludes that disclosure of the information would be prejudicial to the public interest, safety,
or security,
the Attorney General may order the alien removed without further inquiry or hearing by an
immigration judge.
(C) If the Attorney General does not order the removal of the alien under subparagraph (B), the
Attorney General shall specify the further inquiry or hearing that shall be conducted in the case.
(3) Submission of statement and information
The alien or the alien's representative may submit a written statement and additional
information for consideration by the Attorney General.
(d) Authority relating to inspections
(1) Authority to search conveyances
Immigration officers are authorized to board and search any vessel, aircraft, railway car, or
other conveyance or vehicle in which they believe aliens are being brought into the United States.
(2) Authority to order detention and delivery of arriving aliens
Immigration officers are authorized to order an owner, agent, master, commanding officer,
person in charge, purser, or consignee of a vessel or aircraft bringing an alien (except an alien
crewmember) to the United States—
(A) to detain the alien on the vessel or at the airport of arrival, and
(B) to deliver the alien to an immigration officer for inspection or to a medical officer for
examination.
(3) Administration of oath and consideration of evidence
The Attorney General and any immigration officer shall have power to administer oaths and to
take and consider evidence of or from any person touching the privilege of any alien or person he
believes or suspects to be an alien to enter, reenter, transit through, or reside in the United States
or concerning any matter which is material and relevant to the enforcement of this chapter and the
administration of the Service.
(4) Subpoena authority
[Release Point 118-106]

the attendance and testimony of witnesses before immigration officers and the production of
books, papers, and documents relating to the privilege of any person to enter, reenter, reside in, or
pass through the United States or concerning any matter which is material and relevant to the
enforcement of this chapter and the administration of the Service, and to that end may invoke the
aid of any court of the United States.
(B) Any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which investigations or inquiries
are being conducted by an immigration officer may, in the event of neglect or refusal to respond to
a subpoena issued under this paragraph or refusal to testify before an immigration officer, issue an
order requiring such persons to appear before an immigration officer, produce books, papers, and

§1225a. Preinspection at foreign airports
(a) Establishment of preinspection stations
(1) NEW STATIONS.—Subject to paragraph (5), not later than October 31, 1998, the Attorney
General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall establish and maintain preinspection
stations in at least 5 of the foreign airports that are among the 10 foreign airports which the Attorney
General identifies as serving as last points of departure for the greatest numbers of inadmissible alien
passengers who arrive from abroad by air at ports of entry within the United States. Such
preinspection stations shall be in addition to any preinspection stations established prior to
September 30, 1996.
(2) REPORT.—Not later than October 31, 1998, the Attorney General shall report to the
Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate on the
implementation of paragraph (1).
(3) DATA COLLECTION.—Not later than November 1, 1997, and each subsequent November 1,
the Attorney General shall compile data identifying—
[Release Point 118-106]
(A) the foreign airports which served as last points of departure for aliens who arrived by air at
United States ports of entry without valid documentation during the preceding fiscal years;
(B) the number and nationality of such aliens arriving from each such foreign airport; and
(C) the primary routes such aliens followed from their country of origin to the United States.
(4) Subject to paragraph (5), not later than January 1, 2008, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall establish preinspection stations in at least 25
additional foreign airports, which the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, determines, based on the data compiled under paragraph (3) and such other
information as may be available, would most effectively facilitate the travel of admissible aliens and
reduce the number of inadmissible aliens, especially aliens who are potential terrorists, who arrive
from abroad by air at points of entry within the United States. Such preinspection stations shall be in
addition to those established before September 30, 1996, or pursuant to paragraph (1).
(5) CONDITIONS.—Prior to the establishment of a preinspection station, the Attorney General, in
consultation with the Secretary of State, shall ensure that—

accompanying family members will receive appropriate protection;
(B) such employees and their families will not be subject to unreasonable risks to their welfare
and safety; and
(C) the country in which the preinspection station is to be established maintains practices and
procedures with respect to asylum seekers and refugees in accordance with the Convention
Relating to the Status of Refugees (done at Geneva, July 28, 1951), or the Protocol Relating to the
Status of Refugees (done at New York, January 31, 1967), or that an alien in the country otherwise
has recourse to avenues of protection from return to persecution.
(b) Establishment of carrier consultant program and immigration security initiative
The Secretary of Homeland Security shall assign additional immigration officers to assist air
carriers in the detection of fraudulent documents at foreign airports which, based on the records
maintained pursuant to subsection (a)(3), served as a point of departure for a significant number of
arrivals at United States ports of entry without valid documentation, but where no preinspection
station exists. Beginning not later than December 31, 2006, the number of airports selected for an
assignment under this subsection shall be at least 50.

"(a) FINDINGS.—Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the
United States, Congress makes the following findings:
"(1) The exchange of terrorist information with other countries, consistent with privacy requirements,
along with listings of lost and stolen passports, will have immediate security benefits.
"(2) The further away from the borders of the United States that screening occurs, the more security
benefits the United States will gain.

"(1) the Federal Government should exchange terrorist information with trusted allies;
"(2) the Federal Government should move toward real-time verification of passports with issuing
authorities;
"(3) where practicable, the Federal Government should conduct screening before a passenger departs
on a flight destined for the United States;
"(4) the Federal Government should work with other countries to ensure effective inspection regimes
at all airports;
"(5) the Federal Government should work with other countries to improve passport standards and
provide foreign assistance to countries that need help making the transition to the global standard for
identification; and
"(6) the Department of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Department of State and other
Federal agencies, should implement the initiatives called for in this subsection."

necessary to provide protection to a witness, a potential witness, a person cooperating with an
investigation into major criminal activity, or an immediate family member or close associate of a
witness, potential witness, or person cooperating with such an investigation, and the alien satisfies
the Attorney General that the alien will not pose a danger to the safety of other persons or of
property and is likely to appear for any scheduled proceeding. A decision relating to such release
shall take place in accordance with a procedure that considers the severity of the offense
committed by the alien.

for aggravated felonies are aliens;
(B) to designate and train officers and employees of the Service to serve as a liaison to Federal,
State, and local law enforcement and correctional agencies and courts with respect to the arrest,
conviction, and release of any alien charged with an aggravated felony; and
(C) which uses computer resources to maintain a current record of aliens who have been
convicted of an aggravated felony, and indicates those who have been removed.

(A) to inspectors at ports of entry and to border patrol agents at sector headquarters for purposes
of immediate identification of any alien who was previously ordered removed and is seeking to

or parole.

(4) Rule of decision
The law applied by the Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit shall be regarded as the rule of decision in habeas corpus proceedings
described in paragraph (1).

§1228. Expedited removal of aliens convicted of committing aggravated felonies
(a) Removal of criminal aliens
(1) In general
The Attorney General shall provide for the availability of special removal proceedings at certain
Federal, State, and local correctional facilities for aliens convicted of any criminal offense covered
in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title, or any offense covered by section
[Release Point 118-106]
1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) of this title for which both predicate offenses are, without regard to the date of
their commission, otherwise covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title. Such proceedings
shall be conducted in conformity with section 1229a of this title (except as otherwise provided in
this section), and in a manner which eliminates the need for additional detention at any processing
center of the Service and in a manner which assures expeditious removal following the end of the
alien's incarceration for the underlying sentence. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
create any substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable by any party against
the United States or its agencies or officers or any other person.
(2) Implementation
With respect to an alien convicted of an aggravated felony who is taken into custody by the
Attorney General pursuant to section 1226(c) of this title, the Attorney General shall, to the
maximum extent practicable, detain any such felon at a facility at which other such aliens are
detained. In the selection of such facility, the Attorney General shall make reasonable efforts to
ensure that the alien's access to counsel and right to counsel under section 1362 of this title are not
impaired.
(3) Expedited proceedings
(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney General shall provide for the
initiation and, to the extent possible, the completion of removal proceedings, and any
administrative appeals thereof, in the case of any alien convicted of an aggravated felony before
the alien's release from incarceration for the underlying aggravated felony.
(B) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the Attorney General to effect the
removal of any alien sentenced to actual incarceration, before release from the penitentiary or
correctional institution where such alien is confined.
(4) Review
(A) The Attorney General shall review and evaluate removal proceedings conducted under this
section.
(B) The Comptroller General shall monitor, review, and evaluate removal proceedings
conducted under this section. Within 18 months after the effective date of this section, the
Comptroller General shall submit a report to such Committees concerning the extent to which
removal proceedings conducted under this section may adversely affect the ability of such aliens
to contest removal effectively.
(b) Removal of aliens who are not permanent residents
(1) The Attorney General may, in the case of an alien described in paragraph (2), determine the
deportability of such alien under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) of this title (relating to conviction of an
aggravated felony) and issue an order of removal pursuant to the procedures set forth in this
subsection or section 1229a of this title.
(2) An alien is described in this paragraph if the alien—
(A) was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time at which proceedings under
this section commenced; or
(B) had permanent resident status on a conditional basis (as described in section 1186a of this
title) at the time that proceedings under this section commenced.
(3) The Attorney General may not execute any order described in paragraph (1) until 14 calendar
days have passed from the date that such order was issued, unless waived by the alien, in order that
the alien has an opportunity to apply for judicial review under section 1252 of this title.
(4) Proceedings before the Attorney General under this subsection shall be in accordance with
such regulations as the Attorney General shall prescribe. The Attorney General shall provide that—
(A) the alien is given reasonable notice of the charges and of the opportunity described in
subparagraph (C);
(B) the alien shall have the privilege of being represented (at no expense to the government) by
such counsel, authorized to practice in such proceedings, as the alien shall choose;
[Release Point 118-106]
(C) the alien has a reasonable opportunity to inspect the evidence and rebut the charges;
(D) a determination is made for the record that the individual upon whom the notice for the
proceeding under this section is served (either in person or by mail) is, in fact, the alien named in
such notice;
(E) a record is maintained for judicial review; and
(F) the final order of removal is not adjudicated by the same person who issues the charges.
(5) No alien described in this section shall be eligible for any relief from removal that the Attorney
General may grant in the Attorney General's discretion.
1
(c) Presumption of deportability
An alien convicted of an aggravated felony shall be conclusively presumed to be deportable from
the United States.
1
(c) Judicial removal
(1) Authority
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a United States district court shall have
jurisdiction to enter a judicial order of removal at the time of sentencing against an alien who is
deportable, if such an order has been requested by the United States Attorney with the concurrence
of the Commissioner and if the court chooses to exercise such jurisdiction.
(2) Procedure
(A) The United States Attorney shall file with the United States district court, and serve upon
the defendant and the Service, prior to commencement of the trial or entry of a guilty plea a notice
of intent to request judicial removal.
(B) Notwithstanding section 1252b 2 of this title, the United States Attorney, with the
concurrence of the Commissioner, shall file at least 30 days prior to the date set for sentencing a
charge containing factual allegations regarding the alienage of the defendant and identifying the
crime or crimes which make the defendant deportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A) of this title.
(C) If the court determines that the defendant has presented substantial evidence to establish
prima facie eligibility for relief from removal under this chapter, the Commissioner shall provide
the court with a recommendation and report regarding the alien's eligibility for relief. The court
shall either grant or deny the relief sought.
(D)(i) The alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him or her,
to present evidence on his or her own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the
Government.
(ii) The court, for the purposes of determining whether to enter an order described in paragraph
(1), shall only consider evidence that would be admissible in proceedings conducted pursuant to
section 1229a of this title.
(iii) Nothing in this subsection shall limit the information a court of the United States may
receive or consider for the purposes of imposing an appropriate sentence.
(iv) The court may order the alien removed if the Attorney General demonstrates that the alien
is deportable under this chapter.
(3) Notice, appeal, and execution of judicial order of removal
(A)(i) A judicial order of removal or denial of such order may be appealed by either party to the
court of appeals for the circuit in which the district court is located.
(ii) Except as provided in clause (iii), such appeal shall be considered consistent with the
requirements described in section 1252 of this title.
(iii) Upon execution by the defendant of a valid waiver of the right to appeal the conviction on
which the order of removal is based, the expiration of the period described in section 1252(b)(1) of
this title, or the final dismissal of an appeal from such conviction, the order of removal shall
[Release Point 118-106]
become final and shall be executed at the end of the prison term in accordance with the terms of
the order. If the conviction is reversed on direct appeal, the order entered pursuant to this section
shall be void.
(B) As soon as is practicable after entry of a judicial order of removal, the Commissioner shall
provide the defendant with written notice of the order of removal, which shall designate the
defendant's country of choice for removal and any alternate country pursuant to section 1253(a) 2
of this title.
(4) Denial of judicial order
Denial of a request for a judicial order of removal shall not preclude the Attorney General from
initiating removal proceedings pursuant to section 1229a of this title upon the same ground of
deportability or upon any other ground of deportability provided under section 1227(a) of this title.
(5) Stipulated judicial order of removal
The United States Attorney, with the concurrence of the Commissioner, may, pursuant to
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, enter into a plea agreement which calls for the alien, who
is deportable under this chapter, to waive the right to notice and a hearing under this section, and
stipulate to the entry of a judicial order of removal from the United States as a condition of the
plea agreement or as a condition of probation or supervised release, or both. The United States
district court, in both felony and misdemeanor cases, and a United States magistrate judge in
misdemeanor cases, may accept such a stipulation and shall have jurisdiction to enter a judicial
order of removal pursuant to the terms of such stipulation.

(3) Exclusive procedures

In proceedings under this section, under regulations of the Attorney General—

by counsel of the alien's choosing who is authorized to practice in such proceedings,
(B) the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against the alien, to
present evidence on the alien's own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the
Government but these rights shall not entitle the alien to examine such national security
information as the Government may proffer in opposition to the alien's admission to the United

No written notice shall be required under subparagraph (A) if the alien has failed to provide

(C) Rescission of order
Such an order may be rescinded only—
(i) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if
the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances (as
defined in subsection (e)(1)), or
(ii) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not
receive notice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title or the
alien demonstrates that the alien was in Federal or State custody and the failure to appear was
through no fault of the alien.

will be considered frivolous and will be summarily dismissed, and

take actions with respect to inappropriate behavior.
(7) Limitation on discretionary relief for failure to appear
Any alien against whom a final order of removal is entered in absentia under this subsection and
who, at the time of the notice described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title, was
provided oral notice, either in the alien's native language or in another language the alien
understands, of the time and place of the proceedings and of the consequences under this
paragraph of failing, other than because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection
(e)(1)) to attend a proceeding under this section, shall not be eligible for relief under section
1229b, 1229c, 1255, 1258, or 1259 of this title for a period of 10 years after the date of the entry
of the final order of removal.
(c) Decision and burden of proof
(1) Decision
[Release Point 118-106]
(A) In general
At the conclusion of the proceeding the immigration judge shall decide whether an alien is
removable from the United States. The determination of the immigration judge shall be based
only on the evidence produced at the hearing.
(B) Certain medical decisions
If a medical officer or civil surgeon or board of medical officers has certified under section
1222(b) of this title that an alien has a disease, illness, or addiction which would make the alien
inadmissible under paragraph (1) of section 1182(a) of this title, the decision of the immigration
judge shall be based solely upon such certification.
(2) Burden on alien
In the proceeding the alien has the burden of establishing—
(A) if the alien is an applicant for admission, that the alien is clearly and beyond doubt
entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible under section 1182 of this title; or
(B) by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien is lawfully present in the United States
pursuant to a prior admission.
In meeting the burden of proof under subparagraph (B), the alien shall have access to the alien's
visa or other entry document, if any, and any other records and documents, not considered by the
Attorney General to be confidential, pertaining to the alien's admission or presence in the United
States.
(3) Burden on service in cases of deportable aliens
(A) In general
In the proceeding the Service has the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence
that, in the case of an alien who has been admitted to the United States, the alien is deportable.
No decision on deportability shall be valid unless it is based upon reasonable, substantial, and
probative evidence.
(B) Proof of convictions
In any proceeding under this chapter, any of the following documents or records (or a
certified copy of such an official document or record) shall constitute proof of a criminal
conviction:
(i) An official record of judgment and conviction.
(ii) An official record of plea, verdict, and sentence.
(iii) A docket entry from court records that indicates the existence of the conviction.
(iv) Official minutes of a court proceeding or a transcript of a court hearing in which the
court takes notice of the existence of the conviction.
(v) An abstract of a record of conviction prepared by the court in which the conviction was
entered, or by a State official associated with the State's repository of criminal justice records,
that indicates the charge or section of law violated, the disposition of the case, the existence
and date of conviction, and the sentence.
(vi) Any document or record prepared by, or under the direction of, the court in which the
conviction was entered that indicates the existence of a conviction.
(vii) Any document or record attesting to the conviction that is maintained by an official of
a State or Federal penal institution, which is the basis for that institution's authority to assume
custody of the individual named in the record.
(C) Electronic records
In any proceeding under this chapter, any record of conviction or abstract that has been
submitted by electronic means to the Service from a State or court shall be admissible as
evidence to prove a criminal conviction if it is—
(i) certified by a State official associated with the State's repository of criminal justice
records as an official record from its repository or by a court official from the court in which
[Release Point 118-106]
the conviction was entered as an official record from its repository, and
(ii) certified in writing by a Service official as having been received electronically from the
State's record repository or the court's record repository.
A certification under clause (i) may be by means of a computer-generated signature and
statement of authenticity.
(4) Applications for relief from removal
(A) In general
An alien applying for relief or protection from removal has the burden of proof to establish
that the alien—
(i) satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements; and
(ii) with respect to any form of relief that is granted in the exercise of discretion, that the
alien merits a favorable exercise of discretion.
(B) Sustaining burden
The applicant must comply with the applicable requirements to submit information or
documentation in support of the applicant's application for relief or protection as provided by
law or by regulation or in the instructions for the application form. In evaluating the testimony
of the applicant or other witness in support of the application, the immigration judge will
determine whether or not the testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts
sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant has satisfied the applicant's burden of proof. In
determining whether the applicant has met such burden, the immigration judge shall weigh the
credible testimony along with other evidence of record. Where the immigration judge
determines that the applicant should provide evidence which corroborates otherwise credible
testimony, such evidence must be provided unless the applicant demonstrates that the applicant
does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.
(C) Credibility determination
Considering the totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors, the immigration judge
may base a credibility determination on the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the
applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant's or witness's account, the
consistency between the applicant's or witness's written and oral statements (whenever made
and whether or not under oath, and considering the circumstances under which the statements
were made), the internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements
with other evidence of record (including the reports of the Department of State on country
conditions), and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an
inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's claim, or any other
relevant factor. There is no presumption of credibility, however, if no adverse credibility
determination is explicitly made, the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of
credibility on appeal.
(5) Notice
If the immigration judge decides that the alien is removable and orders the alien to be removed,
the judge shall inform the alien of the right to appeal that decision and of the consequences for
failure to depart under the order of removal, including civil and criminal penalties.
(6) Motions to reconsider
(A) In general
The alien may file one motion to reconsider a decision that the alien is removable from the
United States.
(B) Deadline
The motion must be filed within 30 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of
removal.
[Release Point 118-106]
(C) Contents
The motion shall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported
by pertinent authority.
(7) Motions to reopen
(A) In general
An alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section, except that this
limitation shall not apply so as to prevent the filing of one motion to reopen described in
subparagraph (C)(iv).
(B) Contents
The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if
the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.
(C) Deadline
(i) In general
Except as provided in this subparagraph, the motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days
of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.
(ii) Asylum
There is no time limit on the filing of a motion to reopen if the basis of the motion is to
apply for relief under sections 1 1158 or 1231(b)(3) of this title and is based on changed
country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has
been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been
discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.
(iii) Failure to appear
The filing of a motion to reopen an order entered pursuant to subsection (b)(5) is subject to
the deadline specified in subparagraph (C) of such subsection.
(iv) Special rule for battered spouses, children, and parents
Any limitation under this section on the deadlines for filing such motions shall not apply—
(I) if the basis for the motion is to apply for relief under clause (iii) or (iv) of section
1154(a)(1)(A) of this title, clause (ii) or (iii) of section 1154(a)(1)(B) of this title,,1 section
1229b(b) of this title, or section 1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect on March 31, 1997);
(II) if the motion is accompanied by a cancellation of removal application to be filed
with the Attorney General or by a copy of the self-petition that has been or will be filed
with the Immigration and Naturalization Service upon the granting of the motion to
reopen;
(III) if the motion to reopen is filed within 1 year of the entry of the final order of
removal, except that the Attorney General may, in the Attorney General's discretion, waive
this time limitation in the case of an alien who demonstrates extraordinary circumstances
or extreme hardship to the alien's child; and
(IV) if the alien is physically present in the United States at the time of filing the motion.
The filing of a motion to reopen under this clause shall only stay the removal of a qualified
alien (as defined in section 1641(c)(1)(B) of this title 2 pending the final disposition of the
motion, including exhaustion of all appeals if the motion establishes that the alien is a
qualified alien.
(d) Stipulated removal
The Attorney General shall provide by regulation for the entry by an immigration judge of an
order of removal stipulated to by the alien (or the alien's representative) and the Service. A stipulated
order shall constitute a conclusive determination of the alien's removability from the United States.
[Release Point 118-106]

§1229b. Cancellation of removal; adjustment of status
(a) Cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents

deportable from the United States if the alien—

(2) has resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any
status, and
(3) has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.
(b) Cancellation of removal and adjustment of status for certain nonpermanent residents
(1) In general
The Attorney General may cancel removal of, and adjust to the status of an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence, an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United
States if the alien—
(A) has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than
10 years immediately preceding the date of such application;
(B) has been a person of good moral character during such period;
(C) has not been convicted of an offense under section 1182(a)(2), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(3)
of this title, subject to paragraph (5); and
(D) establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to
the alien's spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence.
(2) Special rule for battered spouse or child
(A) Authority
The Attorney General may cancel removal of, and adjust to the status of an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence, an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United
States if the alien demonstrates that—
(i)(I) the alien has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by a spouse or parent who
is or was a United States citizen (or is the parent of a child of a United States citizen and the
child has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by such citizen parent);

or was a lawful permanent resident (or is the parent of a child of an alien who is or was a
lawful permanent resident and the child has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by
such permanent resident parent); or
(III) the alien has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by a United States citizen
or lawful permanent resident whom the alien intended to marry, but whose marriage is not
legitimate because of that United States citizen's or lawful permanent resident's bigamy;
[Release Point 118-106]
(ii) the alien has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not
less than 3 years immediately preceding the date of such application, and the issuance of a
charging document for removal proceedings shall not toll the 3-year period of continuous
physical presence in the United States;
(iii) the alien has been a person of good moral character during such period, subject to the
provisions of subparagraph (C);
(iv) the alien is not inadmissible under paragraph (2) or (3) of section 1182(a) of this title,

subject to paragraph (5), and has not been convicted of an aggravated felony; and
(v) the removal would result in extreme hardship to the alien, the alien's child, or the alien's
parent.
(B) Physical presence
Notwithstanding subsection (d)(2), for purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii) or for purposes of
section 1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect before the title III–A effective date in section 309 of
the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996), an alien shall not
be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence by reason of an absence
if the alien demonstrates a connection between the absence and the battering or extreme cruelty
perpetrated against the alien. No absence or portion of an absence connected to the battering or
extreme cruelty shall count toward the 90-day or 180-day limits established in subsection (d)(2).
If any absence or aggregate absences exceed 180 days, the absences or portions of the absences
will not be considered to break the period of continuous presence. Any such period of time
excluded from the 180-day limit shall be excluded in computing the time during which the alien
has been physically present for purposes of the 3-year requirement set forth in this
subparagraph, subparagraph (A)(ii), and section 1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect before the
title III–A effective date in section 309 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act of 1996).
(C) Good moral character
Notwithstanding section 1101(f) of this title, an act or conviction that does not bar the
Attorney General from granting relief under this paragraph by reason of subparagraph (A)(iv)
shall not bar the Attorney General from finding the alien to be of good moral character under
subparagraph (A)(iii) or section 1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect before the title III–A
effective date in section 309 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility
Act of 1996), if the Attorney General finds that the act or conviction was connected to the
alien's having been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty and determines that a waiver is
otherwise warranted.
(D) Credible evidence considered
In acting on applications under this paragraph, the Attorney General shall consider any
credible evidence relevant to the application. The determination of what evidence is credible
and the weight to be given that evidence shall be within the sole discretion of the Attorney
General.
(3) Recordation of date
With respect to aliens who the Attorney General adjusts to the status of an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence under paragraph (1) or (2), the Attorney General shall record the
alien's lawful admission for permanent residence as of the date of the Attorney General's
cancellation of removal under paragraph (1) or (2).
(4) Children of battered aliens and parents of battered alien children
(A) In general
The Attorney General shall grant parole under section 1182(d)(5) of this title to any alien
who is a—
(i) child of an alien granted relief under section 1229b(b)(2) or 1254(a)(3) of this title (as
[Release Point 118-106]
in effect before the title III–A effective date in section 309 of the Illegal Immigration Reform

§1231. Detention and removal of aliens ordered removed
(a) Detention, release, and removal of aliens ordered removed
(1) Removal period
(A) In general
Except as otherwise provided in this section, when an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney
General shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days (in this section
referred to as the "removal period").
(B) Beginning of period
The removal period begins on the latest of the following:
(i) The date the order of removal becomes administratively final.
(ii) If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of the removal of
the alien, the date of the court's final order.
(iii) If the alien is detained or confined (except under an immigration process), the date the
alien is released from detention or confinement.
(C) Suspension of period
The removal period shall be extended beyond a period of 90 days and the alien may remain in
detention during such extended period if the alien fails or refuses to make timely application in
good faith for travel or other documents necessary to the alien's departure or conspires or acts to
prevent the alien's removal subject to an order of removal.
(2) Detention
During the removal period, the Attorney General shall detain the alien. Under no circumstance
during the removal period shall the Attorney General release an alien who has been found
inadmissible under section 1182(a)(2) or 1182(a)(3)(B) of this title or deportable under section
1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title.
(3) Supervision after 90-day period
If the alien does not leave or is not removed within the removal period, the alien, pending
removal, shall be subject to supervision under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General. The
regulations shall include provisions requiring the alien—
(A) to appear before an immigration officer periodically for identification;
[Release Point 118-106]
(B) to submit, if necessary, to a medical and psychiatric examination at the expense of the
United States Government;
(C) to give information under oath about the alien's nationality, circumstances, habits,
associations, and activities, and other information the Attorney General considers appropriate;
and
(D) to obey reasonable written restrictions on the alien's conduct or activities that the
Attorney General prescribes for the alien.
(4) Aliens imprisoned, arrested, or on parole, supervised release, or probation
(A) In general
Except as provided in section 259(a) 1 of title 42 and paragraph (2),2 the Attorney General
may not remove an alien who is sentenced to imprisonment until the alien is released from
imprisonment. Parole, supervised release, probation, or possibility of arrest or further
imprisonment is not a reason to defer removal.
(B) Exception for removal of nonviolent offenders prior to completion of sentence of
imprisonment
The Attorney General is authorized to remove an alien in accordance with applicable
procedures under this chapter before the alien has completed a sentence of imprisonment—
(i) in the case of an alien in the custody of the Attorney General, if the Attorney General
determines that (I) the alien is confined pursuant to a final conviction for a nonviolent offense
(other than an offense related to smuggling or harboring of aliens or an offense described in
section 1101(a)(43)(B), (C), (E), (I), or (L) of this title 3 and (II) the removal of the alien is
appropriate and in the best interest of the United States; or
(ii) in the case of an alien in the custody of a State (or a political subdivision of a State), if
the chief State official exercising authority with respect to the incarceration of the alien
determines that (I) the alien is confined pursuant to a final conviction for a nonviolent offense
(other than an offense described in section 1101(a)(43)(C) or (E) of this title), (II) the
removal is appropriate and in the best interest of the State, and (III) submits a written request
to the Attorney General that such alien be so removed.

of the United States relating to the reentry of deported aliens, particularly the expanded
penalties for aliens removed under subparagraph (B).
(D) No private right
No cause or claim may be asserted under this paragraph against any official of the United
States or of any State to compel the release, removal, or consideration for release or removal of
any alien.
(5) Reinstatement of removal orders against aliens illegally reentering
If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having
been removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order of
removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, the
alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter, and the alien shall be
removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.
(6) Inadmissible or criminal aliens
An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under section 1182 of this title, removable under
section 1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(4) of this title or who has been determined by the
Attorney General to be a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of removal,
may be detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be subject to the terms of
supervision in paragraph (3).
[Release Point 118-106]
(7) Employment authorization
No alien ordered removed shall be eligible to receive authorization to be employed in the
United States unless the Attorney General makes a specific finding that—

under this section to receive the alien, or
(B) the removal of the alien is otherwise impracticable or contrary to the public interest.
(b) Countries to which aliens may be removed
(1) Aliens arriving at the United States

If the alien boarded the vessel or aircraft on which the alien arrived in the United States in a
foreign territory contiguous to the United States, an island adjacent to the United States, or an
island adjacent to a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, and the alien is not a
native, citizen, subject, or national of, or does not reside in, the territory or island, removal shall
be to the country in which the alien boarded the vessel that transported the alien to the territory
or island.
(C) Alternative countries

Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph—
(i) any alien not described in paragraph (1) who has been ordered removed may designate
one country to which the alien wants to be removed, and
(ii) the Attorney General shall remove the alien to the country the alien so designates.

An alien may designate under subparagraph (A)(i) a foreign territory contiguous to the
United States, an adjacent island, or an island adjacent to a foreign territory contiguous to the
United States as the place to which the alien is to be removed only if the alien is a native,
citizen, subject, or national of, or has resided in, that designated territory or island.
(C) Disregarding designation
The Attorney General may disregard a designation under subparagraph (A)(i) if—
(i) the alien fails to designate a country promptly;
(ii) the government of the country does not inform the Attorney General finally, within 30
days after the date the Attorney General first inquires, whether the government will accept
[Release Point 118-106]
the alien into the country;
(iii) the government of the country is not willing to accept the alien into the country; or
(iv) the Attorney General decides that removing the alien to the country is prejudicial to
the United States.
(D) Alternative country
If an alien is not removed to a country designated under subparagraph (A)(i), the Attorney
General shall remove the alien to a country of which the alien is a subject, national, or citizen
unless the government of the country—
(i) does not inform the Attorney General or the alien finally, within 30 days after the date
the Attorney General first inquires or within another period of time the Attorney General
decides is reasonable, whether the government will accept the alien into the country; or

described in a previous clause of this subparagraph, another country whose government will

(F) Removal country when United States is at war
When the United States is at war and the Attorney General decides that it is impracticable,
inadvisable, inconvenient, or impossible to remove an alien under this subsection because of the
war, the Attorney General may remove the alien—
(i) to the country that is host to a government in exile of the country of which the alien is a
citizen or subject if the government of the host country will permit the alien's entry; or
(ii) if the recognized government of the country of which the alien is a citizen or subject is
not in exile, to a country, or a political or territorial subdivision of a country, that is very near
the country of which the alien is a citizen or subject, or, with the consent of the government
of the country of which the alien is a citizen or subject, to another country.
(3) Restriction on removal to a country where alien's life or freedom would be threatened
(A) In general
Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the Attorney General may not remove an alien to a
country if the Attorney General decides that the alien's life or freedom would be threatened in
that country because of the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social
group, or political opinion.
(B) Exception
Subparagraph (A) does not apply to an alien deportable under section 1227(a)(4)(D) of this
title or if the Attorney General decides that—

crime outside the United States before the alien arrived in the United States; or
(iv) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the alien is a danger to the security of the
United States.
For purposes of clause (ii), an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony (or
felonies) for which the alien has been sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of at
least 5 years shall be considered to have committed a particularly serious crime. The previous
sentence shall not preclude the Attorney General from determining that, notwithstanding the
length of sentence imposed, an alien has been convicted of a particularly serious crime. For
purposes of clause (iv), an alien who is described in section 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title shall be
considered to be an alien with respect to whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a
danger to the security of the United States.

In determining whether an alien has demonstrated that the alien's life or freedom would be
threatened for a reason described in subparagraph (A), the trier of fact shall determine whether

any travel documents necessary for departure or repatriation of the stowaway and removal of the
stowaway will not be unreasonably delayed.
(3) Removal upon order
An owner, agent, master, commanding officer, person in charge, purser, or consignee of a
vessel, aircraft, or other transportation line shall comply with an order of the Attorney General to
take on board, guard safely, and transport to the destination specified any alien ordered to be
removed under this chapter.
(e) Payment of expenses of removal
(1) Costs of removal at time of arrival
In the case of an alien who is a stowaway or who is ordered removed either without a hearing
under section 1225(a)(1) 5 or 1225(c) of this title or pursuant to proceedings under section 1229a
of this title initiated at the time of such alien's arrival, the owner of the vessel or aircraft (if any) on
which the alien arrived in the United States shall pay the transportation cost of removing the alien.
If removal is on a vessel or aircraft not owned by the owner of the vessel or aircraft on which the
alien arrived in the United States, the Attorney General may—
(A) pay the cost from the appropriation "Immigration and Naturalization Service—Salaries
and Expenses"; and

appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter.
(3) Costs of removal from port of removal for aliens admitted or permitted to land
(A) Through appropriation

(B) Through owner
(i) In general
In the case of an alien described in clause (ii), the cost of removal of the alien from the port
of removal may be charged to any owner of the vessel, aircraft, or other transportation line by
which the alien came to the United States.
(ii) Aliens described
[Release Point 118-106]
An alien described in this clause is an alien who—
(I) is admitted to the United States (other than lawfully admitted for permanent
residence) and is ordered removed within 5 years of the date of admission based on a
ground that existed before or at the time of admission, or
(II) is an alien crewman permitted to land temporarily under section 1282 of this title
and is ordered removed within 5 years of the date of landing.
(C) Costs of removal of certain aliens granted voluntary departure
In the case of an alien who has been granted voluntary departure under section 1229c of this
title and who is financially unable to depart at the alien's own expense and whose removal the
Attorney General deems to be in the best interest of the United States, the expense of such
removal may be paid from the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter.
(f) Aliens requiring personal care during removal
(1) In general
If the Attorney General believes that an alien being removed requires personal care because of
the alien's mental or physical condition, the Attorney General may employ a suitable person for
that purpose who shall accompany and care for the alien until the alien arrives at the final
destination.
(2) Costs
The costs of providing the service described in paragraph (1) shall be defrayed in the same
manner as the expense of removing the accompanied alien is defrayed under this section.
(g) Places of detention
(1) In general
The Attorney General shall arrange for appropriate places of detention for aliens detained
pending removal or a decision on removal. When United States Government facilities are
unavailable or facilities adapted or suitably located for detention are unavailable for rental, the
Attorney General may expend from the appropriation "Immigration and Naturalization
Service—Salaries and Expenses", without regard to section 6101 of title 41, amounts necessary to
acquire land and to acquire, build, remodel, repair, and operate facilities (including living quarters
for immigration officers if not otherwise available) necessary for detention.
(2) Detention facilities of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
Prior to initiating any project for the construction of any new detention facility for the Service,
the Commissioner shall consider the availability for purchase or lease of any existing prison, jail,
detention center, or other comparable facility suitable for such use.
(h) Statutory construction
Nothing in this section shall be construed to create any substantive or procedural right or benefit
that is legally enforceable by any party against the United States or its agencies or officers or any
other person.
(i) Incarceration
(1) If the chief executive officer of a State (or, if appropriate, a political subdivision of the State)
exercising authority with respect to the incarceration of an undocumented criminal alien submits a
written request to the Attorney General, the Attorney General shall, as determined by the Attorney
General—
(A) enter into a contractual arrangement which provides for compensation to the State or a
political subdivision of the State, as may be appropriate, with respect to the incarceration of the
undocumented criminal alien; or
(B) take the undocumented criminal alien into the custody of the Federal Government and
incarcerate the alien.
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) Compensation under paragraph (1)(A) shall be the average cost of incarceration of a prisoner
in the relevant State as determined by the Attorney General.
(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term "undocumented criminal alien" means an alien who—

State or a political subdivision of the State has failed to maintain the nonimmigrant status in which
the alien was admitted or to which it was changed under section 1258 of this title, or to comply
with the conditions of any such status.
(4)(A) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall give priority to the Federal

Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General,
and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall develop policies and procedures to ensure
that unaccompanied alien children in the United States are safely repatriated to their country of
nationality or of last habitual residence.
(2) Special rules for children from contiguous countries
(A) Determinations
Any unaccompanied alien child who is a national or habitual resident of a country that is
contiguous with the United States shall be treated in accordance with subparagraph (B), if the
Secretary of Homeland Security determines, on a case-by-case basis, that—
(i) such child has not been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, and there is
no credible evidence that such child is at risk of being trafficked upon return to the child's
country of nationality or of last habitual residence;
(ii) such child does not have a fear of returning to the child's country of nationality or of
last habitual residence owing to a credible fear of persecution; and
(iii) the child is able to make an independent decision to withdraw the child's application
for admission to the United States.
(B) Return
An immigration officer who finds an unaccompanied alien child described in subparagraph
(A) at a land border or port of entry of the United States and determines that such child is
[Release Point 118-106]
inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) may—
(i) permit such child to withdraw the child's application for admission pursuant to section
235(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1225(a)(4)); and
(ii) return such child to the child's country of nationality or country of last habitual
residence.
(C) Contiguous country agreements
The Secretary of State shall negotiate agreements between the United States and countries
contiguous to the United States with respect to the repatriation of children. Such agreements
shall be designed to protect children from severe forms of trafficking in persons, and shall, at a

residence unless returned to appropriate employees or officials, including child welfare
officials where available, of the accepting country's government;

The custody of unaccompanied alien children not described in paragraph (2)(A) who are

(4) Screening
Within 48 hours of the apprehension of a child who is believed to be described in paragraph
(2)(A), but in any event prior to returning such child to the child's country of nationality or of last
habitual residence, the child shall be screened to determine whether the child meets the criteria
listed in paragraph (2)(A). If the child does not meet such criteria, or if no determination can be
made within 48 hours of apprehension, the child shall immediately be transferred to the Secretary
of Health and Human Services and treated in accordance with subsection (b). Nothing in this
paragraph may be construed to preclude an earlier transfer of the child.
(5) Ensuring the safe repatriation of children
(A) Repatriation pilot program

Services.

Each department or agency of the Federal Government shall notify the Department of Health
and Human services 1 within 48 hours upon—
(A) the apprehension or discovery of an unaccompanied alien child; or
(B) any claim or suspicion that an alien in the custody of such department or agency is under

such child is an unaccompanied alien child.
(4) Age determinations
The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland
Security, shall develop procedures to make a prompt determination of the age of an alien, which
shall be used by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Health and Human
Services for children in their respective custody. At a minimum, these procedures shall take into
account multiple forms of evidence, including the non-exclusive use of radiographs, to determine
the age of the unaccompanied alien.
(c) Providing safe and secure placements for children
(1) Policies and programs
The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Homeland Security, Attorney
General, and Secretary of State shall establish policies and programs to ensure that unaccompanied
alien children in the United States are protected from traffickers and other persons seeking to
[Release Point 118-106]
victimize or otherwise engage such children in criminal, harmful, or exploitative activity,
including policies and programs reflecting best practices in witness security programs.
(2) Safe and secure placements
(A) Minors in department of health and human services custody
Subject to section 279(b)(2) of title 6, an unaccompanied alien child in the custody of the
Secretary of Health and Human Services shall be promptly placed in the least restrictive setting
that is in the best interest of the child. In making such placements, the Secretary may consider
danger to self, danger to the community, and risk of flight. Placement of child trafficking
victims may include placement in an Unaccompanied Refugee Minor program, pursuant to
section 412(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1522(d)), if a suitable family
member is not available to provide care. A child shall not be placed in a secure facility absent a
determination that the child poses a danger to self or others or has been charged with having
committed a criminal offense. The placement of a child in a secure facility shall be reviewed, at
a minimum, on a monthly basis, in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Secretary, to
determine if such placement remains warranted.
(B) Aliens transferred from Department of Health and Human Services to Department of
Homeland Security custody
If a minor described in subparagraph (A) reaches 18 years of age and is transferred to the
custody of the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary shall consider placement in the
least restrictive setting available after taking into account the alien's danger to self, danger to the
community, and risk of flight. Such aliens shall be eligible to participate in alternative to
detention programs, utilizing a continuum of alternatives based on the alien's need for
supervision, which may include placement of the alien with an individual or an organizational
sponsor, or in a supervised group home.
(3) Safety and suitability assessments
(A) In general
Subject to the requirements of subparagraph (B), an unaccompanied alien child may not be
placed with a person or entity unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services makes a
determination that the proposed custodian is capable of providing for the child's physical and
mental well-being. Such determination shall, at a minimum, include verification of the
custodian's identity and relationship to the child, if any, as well as an independent finding that
the individual has not engaged in any activity that would indicate a potential risk to the child.
(B) Home studies
Before placing the child with an individual, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
determine whether a home study is first necessary. A home study shall be conducted for a child
who is a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, a special needs child with a disability
(as defined in section 12102 of title 42), a child who has been a victim of physical or sexual
abuse under circumstances that indicate that the child's health or welfare has been significantly
harmed or threatened, or a child whose proposed sponsor clearly presents a risk of abuse,
maltreatment, exploitation, or trafficking to the child based on all available objective evidence.
The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall conduct follow-up services, during the
pendency of removal proceedings, on children for whom a home study was conducted and is
authorized to conduct follow-up services in cases involving children with mental health or other
needs who could benefit from ongoing assistance from a social welfare agency.
(C) Access to information
Not later than 2 weeks after receiving a request from the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide information necessary to conduct
suitability assessments from appropriate Federal, State, and local law enforcement and
immigration databases.
[Release Point 118-106]
(4) Legal orientation presentations
The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall cooperate with the Executive Office for
Immigration Review to ensure that custodians receive legal orientation presentations provided
through the Legal Orientation Program administered by the Executive Office for Immigration
Review. At a minimum, such presentations shall address the custodian's responsibility to attempt
to ensure the child's appearance at all immigration proceedings and to protect the child from
mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.
(5) Access to counsel
The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable and
consistent with section 292 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1362), that all
unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the custody of the Secretary or the
Secretary of Homeland Security, and who are not described in subsection (a)(2)(A), have counsel
to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from mistreatment,
exploitation, and trafficking. To the greatest extent practicable, the Secretary of Health and
Human Services shall make every effort to utilize the services of pro bono counsel who agree to
provide representation to such children without charge.
(6) Child advocates
(A) In general
The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to appoint independent child
advocates for child trafficking victims and other vulnerable unaccompanied alien children. A
child advocate shall be provided access to materials necessary to effectively advocate for the
best interest of the child. The child advocate shall not be compelled to testify or provide
evidence in any proceeding concerning any information or opinion received from the child in
the course of serving as a child advocate. The child advocate shall be presumed to be acting in
good faith and be immune from civil liability for lawful conduct of duties as described in this
provision.

Not later than 3 years after March 7, 2013, the Secretary shall appoint child advocates at
not more than 3 additional immigration detention sites.
(iii) Selection of sites
Sites at which child advocate programs will be established under this subparagraph shall be
located at immigration detention sites at which more than 50 children are held in immigration
custody, and shall be selected sequentially, with priority given to locations with—
(I) the largest number of unaccompanied alien children; and
(II) the most vulnerable populations of unaccompanied children.
(C) Restrictions
(i) Administrative expenses
A child advocate program may not use more that 10 percent of the Federal funds received
under this section for administrative expenses.

Nothing in this section may be construed to restrict the ability of a child advocate program

programs described in this section.
[Release Point 118-106]
(iii) Contribution of funds
A child advocate program selected under this section shall contribute non-Federal funds,

The alien shall serve and file a brief in connection with a petition for judicial review not later
than 40 days after the date on which the administrative record is available, and may serve and
file a reply brief not later than 14 days after service of the brief of the Attorney General, and the

from the pleadings and affidavits that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner's
nationality is presented, the court shall decide the nationality claim.
(B) Transfer if issue of fact
If the petitioner claims to be a national of the United States and the court of appeals finds that
a genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner's nationality is presented, the court shall
transfer the proceeding to the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which
the petitioner resides for a new hearing on the nationality claim and a decision on that claim as

shall hold a new hearing on the nationality claim and decide that claim as if an action had
been brought under section 2201 of title 28.
The defendant may have such nationality claim decided only as provided in this subparagraph.
(C) Consequence of invalidation
If the district court rules that the removal order is invalid, the court shall dismiss the

A court may review a final order of removal only if—
(1) the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right, and
(2) another court has not decided the validity of the order, unless the reviewing court finds that
the petition presents grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judicial proceeding or
that the remedy provided by the prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity
of the order.
(e) Judicial review of orders under section 1225(b)(1)
(1) Limitations on relief
Without regard to the nature of the action or claim and without regard to the identity of the
party or parties bringing the action, no court may—
(A) enter declaratory, injunctive, or other equitable relief in any action pertaining to an order
to exclude an alien in accordance with section 1225(b)(1) of this title except as specifically
authorized in a subsequent paragraph of this subsection, or

available in an action instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia,
but shall be limited to determinations of—
(i) whether such section, or any regulation issued to implement such section, is
constitutional; or
(ii) whether such a regulation, or a written policy directive, written policy guideline, or
written procedure issued by or under the authority of the Attorney General to implement such
section, is not consistent with applicable provisions of this subchapter or is otherwise in
violation of law.
(B) Deadlines for bringing actions
Any action instituted under this paragraph must be filed no later than 60 days after the date
the challenged section, regulation, directive, guideline, or procedure described in clause (i) or
(ii) of subparagraph (A) is first implemented.
(C) Notice of appeal
A notice of appeal of an order issued by the District Court under this paragraph may be filed
not later than 30 days after the date of issuance of such order.
(D) Expeditious consideration of cases
[Release Point 118-106]

disposition of any case considered under this paragraph.

(B) has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the alien is an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence, has been admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this
title, or has been granted asylum under section 1158 of this title, the court may order no remedy
or relief other than to require that the petitioner be provided a hearing in accordance with
section 1229a of this title. Any alien who is provided a hearing under section 1229a of this title
pursuant to this paragraph may thereafter obtain judicial review of any resulting final order of
removal pursuant to subsection (a)(1).
(5) Scope of inquiry
In determining whether an alien has been ordered removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title,
the court's inquiry shall be limited to whether such an order in fact was issued and whether it
relates to the petitioner. There shall be no review of whether the alien is actually inadmissible or
entitled to any relief from removal.
(f) Limit on injunctive relief
(1) In general

the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or
restrain the operation of the provisions of part IV of this subchapter, as amended by the Illegal
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, other than with respect to the
application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part
have been initiated.
(2) Particular cases
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall enjoin the removal of any alien
pursuant to a final order under this section unless the alien shows by clear and convincing
evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.

§1254a. Temporary protected status
(a) Granting of status
(1) In general
In the case of an alien who is a national of a foreign state designated under subsection (b) (or in
the case of an alien having no nationality, is a person who last habitually resided in such
designated state) and who meets the requirements of subsection (c), the Attorney General, in
accordance with this section—
(A) may grant the alien temporary protected status in the United States and shall not remove
the alien from the United States during the period in which such status is in effect, and
(B) shall authorize the alien to engage in employment in the United States and provide the
alien with an "employment authorized" endorsement or other appropriate work permit.
(2) Duration of work authorization
Work authorization provided under this section shall be effective throughout the period the alien
[Release Point 118-106]
is in temporary protected status under this section.
(3) Notice
(A) Upon the granting of temporary protected status under this section, the Attorney General
shall provide the alien with information concerning such status under this section.
(B) If, at the time of initiation of a removal proceeding against an alien, the foreign state (of
which the alien is a national) is designated under subsection (b), the Attorney General shall
promptly notify the alien of the temporary protected status that may be available under this
section.
(C) If, at the time of designation of a foreign state under subsection (b), an alien (who is a
national of such state) is in a removal proceeding under this subchapter, the Attorney General shall
promptly notify the alien of the temporary protected status that may be available under this
section.
(D) Notices under this paragraph shall be provided in a form and language that the alien can
understand.
(4) Temporary treatment for eligible aliens
(A) In the case of an alien who can establish a prima facie case of eligibility for benefits under
paragraph (1), but for the fact that the period of registration under subsection (c)(1)(A)(iv) has not
begun, until the alien has had a reasonable opportunity to register during the first 30 days of such
period, the Attorney General shall provide for the benefits of paragraph (1).
(B) In the case of an alien who establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for benefits under
paragraph (1), until a final determination with respect to the alien's eligibility for such benefits
under paragraph (1) has been made, the alien shall be provided such benefits.
(5) Clarification
Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the Attorney General to deny
temporary protected status to an alien based on the alien's immigration status or to require any
alien, as a condition of being granted such status, either to relinquish nonimmigrant or other status
the alien may have or to execute any waiver of other rights under this chapter. The granting of
temporary protected status under this section shall not be considered to be inconsistent with the
granting of nonimmigrant status under this chapter.
(b) Designations
(1) In general
The Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, may
designate any foreign state (or any part of such foreign state) under this subsection only if—
(A) the Attorney General finds that there is an ongoing armed conflict within the state and,
due to such conflict, requiring the return of aliens who are nationals of that state to that state (or
to the part of the state) would pose a serious threat to their personal safety;
(B) the Attorney General finds that—
(i) there has been an earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic, or other environmental disaster
in the state resulting in a substantial, but temporary, disruption of living conditions in the area
affected,
(ii) the foreign state is unable, temporarily, to handle adequately the return to the state of
aliens who are nationals of the state, and
(iii) the foreign state officially has requested designation under this subparagraph; or
(C) the Attorney General finds that there exist extraordinary and temporary conditions in the
foreign state that prevent aliens who are nationals of the state from returning to the state in
safety, unless the Attorney General finds that permitting the aliens to remain temporarily in the
United States is contrary to the national interest of the United States.
A designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under this paragraph shall not
[Release Point 118-106]
become effective unless notice of the designation (including a statement of the findings under this
paragraph and the effective date of the designation) is published in the Federal Register. In such
notice, the Attorney General shall also state an estimate of the number of nationals of the foreign
state designated who are (or within the effective period of the designation are likely to become)
eligible for temporary protected status under this section and their immigration status in the United
States.
(2) Effective period of designation for foreign states
The designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under paragraph (1) shall—
(A) take effect upon the date of publication of the designation under such paragraph, or such
later date as the Attorney General may specify in the notice published under such paragraph,
and
(B) shall remain in effect until the effective date of the termination of the designation under
paragraph (3)(B).
For purposes of this section, the initial period of designation of a foreign state (or part thereof)
under paragraph (1) is the period, specified by the Attorney General, of not less than 6 months and
not more than 18 months.
(3) Periodic review, terminations, and extensions of designations
(A) Periodic review
At least 60 days before end of the initial period of designation, and any extended period of
designation, of a foreign state (or part thereof) under this section the Attorney General, after
consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, shall review the conditions in the
foreign state (or part of such foreign state) for which a designation is in effect under this
subsection and shall determine whether the conditions for such designation under this
subsection continue to be met. The Attorney General shall provide on a timely basis for the
publication of notice of each such determination (including the basis for the determination, and,
in the case of an affirmative determination, the period of extension of designation under
subparagraph (C)) in the Federal Register.
(B) Termination of designation
If the Attorney General determines under subparagraph (A) that a foreign state (or part of
such foreign state) no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation under paragraph
(1), the Attorney General shall terminate the designation by publishing notice in the Federal
Register of the determination under this subparagraph (including the basis for the
determination). Such termination is effective in accordance with subsection (d)(3), but shall not
be effective earlier than 60 days after the date the notice is published or, if later, the expiration
of the most recent previous extension under subparagraph (C).
(C) Extension of designation
If the Attorney General does not determine under subparagraph (A) that a foreign state (or
part of such foreign state) no longer meets the conditions for designation under paragraph (1),
the period of designation of the foreign state is extended for an additional period of 6 months
(or, in the discretion of the Attorney General, a period of 12 or 18 months).
(4) Information concerning protected status at time of designations
At the time of a designation of a foreign state under this subsection, the Attorney General shall
make available information respecting the temporary protected status made available to aliens who
are nationals of such designated foreign state.
(5) Review
(A) Designations
There is no judicial review of any determination of the Attorney General with respect to the
designation, or termination or extension of a designation, of a foreign state under this
[Release Point 118-106]
subsection.
(B) Application to individuals
The Attorney General shall establish an administrative procedure for the review of the denial
of benefits to aliens under this subsection. Such procedure shall not prevent an alien from
asserting protection under this section in removal proceedings if the alien demonstrates that the
alien is a national of a state designated under paragraph (1).
(c) Aliens eligible for temporary protected status
(1) In general
(A) Nationals of designated foreign states
Subject to paragraph (3), an alien, who is a national of a state designated under subsection
(b)(1) (or in the case of an alien having no nationality, is a person who last habitually resided in
such designated state), meets the requirements of this paragraph only if—
(i) the alien has been continuously physically present in the United States since the
effective date of the most recent designation of that state;
(ii) the alien has continuously resided in the United States since such date as the Attorney
General may designate;
(iii) the alien is admissible as an immigrant, except as otherwise provided under paragraph
(2)(A), and is not ineligible for temporary protected status under paragraph (2)(B); and
(iv) to the extent and in a manner which the Attorney General establishes, the alien
registers for the temporary protected status under this section during a registration period of
not less than 180 days.
(B) Registration fee
The Attorney General may require payment of a reasonable fee as a condition of registering
an alien under subparagraph (A)(iv) (including providing an alien with an "employment
authorized" endorsement or other appropriate work permit under this section). The amount of
any such fee shall not exceed $50. In the case of aliens registered pursuant to a designation
under this section made after July 17, 1991, the Attorney General may impose a separate,
additional fee for providing an alien with documentation of work authorization.
Notwithstanding section 3302 of title 31, all fees collected under this subparagraph shall be
credited to the appropriation to be used in carrying out this section.
(2) Eligibility standards
(A) Waiver of certain grounds for inadmissibility
In the determination of an alien's admissibility for purposes of subparagraph (A)(iii) of
paragraph (1)—
(i) the provisions of paragraphs (5) and (7)(A) of section 1182(a) of this title shall not
apply;
(ii) except as provided in clause (iii), the Attorney General may waive any other provision
of section 1182(a) of this title in the case of individual aliens for humanitarian purposes, to
assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest; but
(iii) the Attorney General may not waive—
(I) paragraphs (2)(A) and (2)(B) (relating to criminals) of such section,
(II) paragraph (2)(C) of such section (relating to drug offenses), except for so much of
such paragraph as relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of
marijuana, or
(III) paragraphs (3)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), and (3)(E) of such section (relating to national
security and participation in the Nazi persecutions or those who have engaged in
genocide).
(B) Aliens ineligible
An alien shall not be eligible for temporary protected status under this section if the Attorney
[Release Point 118-106]
General finds that—
(i) the alien has been convicted of any felony or 2 or more misdemeanors committed in the
United States, or
(ii) the alien is described in section 1158(b)(2)(A) of this title.
(3) Withdrawal of temporary protected status
The Attorney General shall withdraw temporary protected status granted to an alien under this
section if—
(A) the Attorney General finds that the alien was not in fact eligible for such status under this
section,
(B) except as provided in paragraph (4) and permitted in subsection (f)(3), the alien has not
remained continuously physically present in the United States from the date the alien first was
granted temporary protected status under this section, or
(C) the alien fails, without good cause, to register with the Attorney General annually, at the
end of each 12-month period after the granting of such status, in a form and manner specified
by the Attorney General.
(4) Treatment of brief, casual, and innocent departures and certain other absences
(A) For purposes of paragraphs (1)(A)(i) and (3)(B), an alien shall not be considered to have
failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the United States by virtue of brief, casual, and
innocent absences from the United States, without regard to whether such absences were
authorized by the Attorney General.
(B) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(ii), an alien shall not be considered to have failed to
maintain continuous residence in the United States by reason of a brief, casual, and innocent
absence described in subparagraph (A) or due merely to a brief temporary trip abroad required by
emergency or extenuating circumstances outside the control of the alien.
(5) Construction
Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing an alien to apply for admission to, or to
be admitted to, the United States in order to apply for temporary protected status under this
section.
(6) Confidentiality of information
The Attorney General shall establish procedures to protect the confidentiality of information
provided by aliens under this section.
(d) Documentation
(1) Initial issuance
Upon the granting of temporary protected status to an alien under this section, the Attorney
General shall provide for the issuance of such temporary documentation and authorization as may
be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.
(2) Period of validity
Subject to paragraph (3), such documentation shall be valid during the initial period of
designation of the foreign state (or part thereof) involved and any extension of such period. The
Attorney General may stagger the periods of validity of the documentation and authorization in
order to provide for an orderly renewal of such documentation and authorization and for an
orderly transition (under paragraph (3)) upon the termination of a designation of a foreign state (or
any part of such foreign state).
(3) Effective date of terminations
If the Attorney General terminates the designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign
state) under subsection (b)(3)(B), such termination shall only apply to documentation and
authorization issued or renewed after the effective date of the publication of notice of the
[Release Point 118-106]
determination under that subsection (or, at the Attorney General's option, after such period after
the effective date of the determination as the Attorney General determines to be appropriate in
order to provide for an orderly transition).
(4) Detention of alien
An alien provided temporary protected status under this section shall not be detained by the
Attorney General on the basis of the alien's immigration status in the United States.
(e) Relation of period of temporary protected status to cancellation of removal
With respect to an alien granted temporary protected status under this section, the period of such
status shall not be counted as a period of physical presence in the United States for purposes of
section 1229b(a) of this title, unless the Attorney General determines that extreme hardship exists.
Such period shall not cause a break in the continuity of residence of the period before and after such
period for purposes of such section.
(f) Benefits and status during period of temporary protected status
During a period in which an alien is granted temporary protected status under this section—
(1) the alien shall not be considered to be permanently residing in the United States under color
of law;
(2) the alien may be deemed ineligible for public assistance by a State (as defined in section
1101(a)(36) of this title) or any political subdivision thereof which furnishes such assistance;
(3) the alien may travel abroad with the prior consent of the Attorney General; and
(4) for purposes of adjustment of status under section 1255 of this title and change of status
under section 1258 of this title, the alien shall be considered as being in, and maintaining, lawful
status as a nonimmigrant.
(g) Exclusive remedy
Except as otherwise specifically provided, this section shall constitute the exclusive authority of
the Attorney General under law to permit aliens who are or may become otherwise deportable or
have been paroled into the United States to remain in the United States temporarily because of their
particular nationality or region of foreign state of nationality.
(h) Limitation on consideration in Senate of legislation adjusting status
(1) In general
Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill,
resolution, or amendment that—
(A) provides for adjustment to lawful temporary or permanent resident alien status for any
alien receiving temporary protected status under this section, or
(B) has the effect of amending this subsection or limiting the application of this subsection.
(2) Supermajority required
Paragraph (1) may be waived or suspended in the Senate only by the affirmative vote of
three-fifths of the Members duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the
Members of the Senate duly chosen and sworn shall be required in the Senate to sustain an appeal
of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under paragraph (1).
(3) Rules
Paragraphs (1) and (2) are enacted—
(A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and as such they are deemed a part
of the rules of the Senate, but applicable only with respect to the matters described in paragraph
(1) and supersede other rules of the Senate only to the extent that such paragraphs are
inconsistent therewith; and
(B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of the Senate to change such rules at any
time, in the same manner as in the case of any other rule of the Senate.
(i) Annual report and review
[Release Point 118-106]
(1) Annual report
Not later than March 1 of each year (beginning with 1992), the Attorney General, after
consultation with the appropriate agencies of the Government, shall submit a report to the
Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate on the operation of
this section during the previous year. Each report shall include—

(B) the number of nationals of each such state who have been granted temporary protected
status under this section and their immigration status before being granted such status, and
(C) an explanation of the reasons why foreign states or parts thereof were designated under
subsection (b)(1) and, with respect to foreign states or parts thereof previously designated, why

In applying this section to a special immigrant described in section 1101(a)(27)(K) of this title,

In applying this section to a special immigrant described in section 1101(a)(27)(J) of this title—
(1) such an immigrant shall be deemed, for purposes of subsection (a), to have been paroled into

(A) paragraphs (4), (5)(A), (6)(A), (6)(C), (6)(D), (7)(A), and (9)(B) of section 1182(a) of

and (3)(E)) in the case of individual aliens for humanitarian purposes, family unity, or when it is
otherwise in the public interest.
The relationship between an alien and the alien's natural parents or prior adoptive parents shall not
be considered a factor in making a waiver under paragraph (2)(B). Nothing in this subsection or
section 1101(a)(27)(J) of this title shall be construed as authorizing an alien to apply for admission or
be admitted to the United States in order to obtain special immigrant status described in such section.
(i) Adjustment in status of certain aliens physically present in United States
(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, an alien physically

(ii) is within one of the classes enumerated in subsection (c) of this section;
(B) who is the beneficiary (including a spouse or child of the principal alien, if eligible to
receive a visa under section 1153(d) of this title) of—
(i) a petition for classification under section 1154 of this title that was filed with the Attorney
General on or before April 30, 2001; or
(ii) an application for a labor certification under section 1182(a)(5)(A) of this title that was

certification, described in subparagraph (B) that was filed after January 14, 1998, is physically
present in the United States on December 21, 2000;
may apply to the Attorney General for the adjustment of his or her status to that of an alien
lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The Attorney General may accept such application only
if the alien remits with such application a sum equalling $1,000 as of the date of receipt of the
application, but such sum shall not be required from a child under the age of seventeen, or an alien
who is the spouse or unmarried child of an individual who obtained temporary or permanent resident
status under section 1160 or 1255a of this title or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control
Act of 1986 at any date, who—

(2) Upon receipt of such an application and the sum hereby required, the Attorney General may
adjust the status of the alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if—
(A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for
permanent residence; and
(B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.
(3)(A) The portion of each application fee (not to exceed $200) that the Attorney General
determines is required to process an application under this section and is remitted to the Attorney
General pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall be disposed of by the Attorney
General as provided in subsections (m), (n), and (o) of section 1356 of this title.
(B) Any remaining portion of such fees remitted under such paragraphs shall be deposited by the
Attorney General into the Breached Bond/Detention Fund established under section 1356(r) of this
title, except that in the case of fees attributable to applications for a beneficiary with respect to whom
a petition for classification, or an application for labor certification, described in paragraph (1)(B)

(B) the provision of such information has substantially contributed to the success of an
authorized criminal investigation or the prosecution of an individual described in subclause (III) of
that section,
the Attorney General may adjust the status of the alien (and the spouse, married and unmarried
sons and daughters, and parents of the alien if admitted under that section) to that of an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence if the alien is not described in section 1182(a)(3)(E) of this title.
(2) If, in the sole discretion of the Attorney General—
(A) a nonimmigrant admitted into the United States under section 1101(a)(15)(S)(ii) of this title
has supplied information described in subclause (I) of such section, and
(B) the provision of such information has substantially contributed to—
(i) the prevention or frustration of an act of terrorism against a United States person or United
States property, or
(ii) the success of an authorized criminal investigation of, or the prosecution of, an individual
involved in such an act of terrorism, and
(C) the nonimmigrant has received a reward under section 2708(a) of title 22,
the Attorney General may adjust the status of the alien (and the spouse, married and unmarried
sons and daughters, and parents of the alien if admitted under such section) to that of an alien
lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien is not described in section 1182(a)(3)(E) of
this title.
(3) Upon the approval of adjustment of status under paragraph (1) or (2), the Attorney General

that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien admitted under section 1101(a)(15)(T) of this title
who is inadmissible to the United States by reason of a ground that has not been waived under
section 1182 of this title, except that, if the Secretary of Homeland Security considers it to be in the
national interest to do so, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in the Attorney General's 6 discretion,

the victimization described in section 1101(a)(15)(T)(i)(I) of this title.
(3) An alien shall be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the

(A) the absence was necessary to assist in the investigation or prosecution described in
paragraph (1)(A); or

criminal activity described in section 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of this title.
(B) Nothing in paragraph (1)(B) may be construed to prevent the Secretary from consulting with

beginning of the application period described in subsection (a)(1)(A) and who can establish a

he may not apply for such adjustment until the beginning of such period), until the alien has had
the opportunity during the first 30 days of the application period to complete the filing of an
application for adjustment, the alien—
(A) may not be deported, and
(B) shall be granted authorization to engage in employment in the United States and be
provided an "employment authorized" endorsement or other appropriate work permit.

contained in such record shall be conclusive unless the applicant can establish abuse of
discretion or that the findings are directly contrary to clear and convincing facts contained in the
record considered as a whole.
(C) Jurisdiction of courts
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction of any cause of
action or claim by or on behalf of any person asserting an interest under this section unless such

eligibility to receive medical assistance—

§1255b. Adjustment of status of certain nonimmigrants to that of persons
admitted for permanent residence
Notwithstanding any other provision of law—
(a) Application
Any alien admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant under the provisions of either section
101(a)(15)(A)(i) or (ii) or 101(a)(15)(G)(i) or (ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C.
1101(a)(15)(A)(i), (ii), (G)(i), (ii)], who has failed to maintain a status under any of those provisions,
may apply to the Attorney General for adjustment of his status to that of an alien lawfully admitted
for permanent residence.
(b) Record of admission
If, after consultation with the Secretary of State, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Attorney
General that the alien has shown compelling reasons demonstrating both that the alien is unable to
return to the country represented by the government which accredited the alien or the member of the
alien's immediate family and that adjustment of the alien's status to that of an alien lawfully admitted
for permanent residence would be in the national interest, that the alien is a person of good moral
character, that he is admissible for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act
[8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.], and that such action would not be contrary to the national welfare, safety, or
security, the Attorney General, in his discretion, may record the alien's lawful admission for
permanent residence as of the date the order of the Attorney General approving the application for
adjustment of status is made.
(c) Report to the Congress; resolution not favoring adjustment of status; reduction of quota
A complete and detailed statement of the facts and pertinent provisions of law in the case shall be
reported to the Congress with the reasons for such adjustment of status. Such reports shall be
submitted on the first day of each calendar month in which Congress is in session. The Secretary of
State shall, if the alien was classifiable as a quota immigrant at the time of his entry, reduce by one
the quota of the quota area to which the alien is chargeable under section 202 of the Immigration and
Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1152] for the fiscal year then current or the next following year in which a
quota is available. No quota shall be so reduced by more than 50 per centum in any fiscal year.
[Release Point 118-106]
(d) Limitations
The number of aliens who may be granted the status of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent
residence in any fiscal year, pursuant to this section, shall not exceed fifty.

(a) If, at any time within five years after the status of a person has been otherwise adjusted under

PART VI—SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO ALIEN CREWMEN
§1281. Alien crewmen
(a) Arrival; submission of list; exceptions
Upon arrival of any vessel or aircraft in the United States from any place outside the United States
it shall be the duty of the owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer thereof to deliver
to an immigration officer at the port of arrival (1) a complete, true, and correct list containing the
names of all aliens employed on such vessel or aircraft, the positions they respectively hold in the
crew of the vessel or aircraft, when and where they were respectively shipped or engaged, and those
to be paid off or discharged in the port of arrival; or (2) in the discretion of the Attorney General,
such a list containing so much of such information, or such additional or supplemental information,
as the Attorney General shall by regulations prescribe. In the case of a vessel engaged solely in
traffic on the Great Lakes, Saint Lawrence River, and connecting waterways, such lists shall be
furnished at such times as the Attorney General may require.
(b) Reports of illegal landings
It shall be the duty of any owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer of any vessel or
aircraft to report to an immigration officer, in writing, as soon as discovered, all cases in which any
alien crewman has illegally landed in the United States from the vessel or aircraft, together with a
description of such alien and any information likely to lead to his apprehension.
(c) Departure; submission of list; exceptions
Before the departure of any vessel or aircraft from any port in the United States, it shall be the
duty of the owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer thereof, to deliver to an
immigration officer at that port (1) a list containing the names of all alien employees who were not
employed thereon at the time of the arrival at that port but who will leave such port thereon at the
time of the departure of such vessel or aircraft and the names of those, if any, who have been paid off
or discharged, and of those, if any, who have deserted or landed at that port, or (2) in the discretion
of the Attorney General, such a list containing so much of such information, or such additional or
supplemental information, as the Attorney General shall by regulations prescribe. In the case of a
vessel engaged solely in traffic on the Great Lakes, Saint Lawrence River, and connecting
waterways, such lists shall be furnished at such times as the Attorney General may require.
(d) Violations
In case any owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer shall fail to deliver complete,
true, and correct lists or reports of aliens, or to report cases of desertion or landing, as required by
subsections (a), (b), and (c), such owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer, shall, if
required by the Attorney General, pay to the Commissioner the sum of $200 for each alien
concerning whom such lists are not delivered or such reports are not made as required in the
preceding subsections. In the case that any owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer
of a vessel shall secure services of an alien crewman described in section 1101(a)(15)(D)(i) of this
title to perform longshore work not included in the normal operation and service on board the vessel
under section 1288 of this title, the owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer shall pay
to the Commissioner the sum of $5,000, and such fine shall be a lien against the vessel. No such
vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance from any port at which it arrives pending the
determination of the question of the liability to the payment of such fine, and if such fine is imposed,
while it remains unpaid. No such fine shall be remitted or refunded. Clearance may be granted prior
to the determination of such question upon deposit of a bond or a sum sufficient to cover such fine.
[Release Point 118-106]
(e) Regulations
The Attorney General is authorized to prescribe by regulations the circumstances under which a
vessel or aircraft shall be deemed to be arriving in, or departing from the United States or any port
thereof within the meaning of any provision of this part.

§1282. Conditional permits to land temporarily
(a) Period of time
No alien crewman shall be permitted to land temporarily in the United States except as provided in
this section and sections 1182(d)(3), (5) and 1283 of this title. If an immigration officer finds upon
examination that an alien crewman is a nonimmigrant under paragraph (15)(D) of section 1101(a) of
this title and is otherwise admissible and has agreed to accept such permit, he may, in his discretion,
grant the crewman a conditional permit to land temporarily pursuant to regulations prescribed by the
Attorney General, subject to revocation in subsequent proceedings as provided in subsection (b), and
for a period of time, in any event, not to exceed—
(1) the period of time (not exceeding twenty-nine days) during which the vessel or aircraft on
which he arrived remains in port, if the immigration officer is satisfied that the crewman intends to
depart on the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived;
(2) twenty-nine days, if the immigration officer is satisfied that the crewman intends to depart,
[Release Point 118-106]
within the period for which he is permitted to land, on a vessel or aircraft other than the one on
which he arrived; or
(3) 180 days, if the immigration officer determines that the crewman—
(A) intends to depart, within the period for which the crewman is permitted to land, on the
same vessel or on a vessel or aircraft other than the vessel on which the crewman arrived; and
(B) will perform ship-to-ship liquid cargo transfer operations to or from any other vessel
engaged in foreign trade during such period.
(b) Revocation; expenses of detention
Pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, any immigration officer may, in his
discretion, if he determines that an alien is not a bona fide crewman, or does not intend to depart on
the vessel or aircraft which brought him, revoke the conditional permit to land which was granted
such crewman under the provisions of subsection (a)(1), take such crewman into custody, and
require the master or commanding officer of the vessel or aircraft on which the crewman arrived to
receive and detain him on board such vessel or aircraft, if practicable, and such crewman shall be
removed from the United States at the expense of the transportation line which brought him to the
United States. Until such alien is so removed, any expenses of his detention shall be borne by such
transportation company. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the procedure
prescribed in section 1229a of this title to cases falling within the provisions of this subsection.
(c) Penalties
Any alien crewman who willfully remains in the United States in excess of the number of days
allowed in any conditional permit issued under subsection (a) shall be fined under title 18 or
imprisoned not more than 6 months, or both.

§1283. Hospital treatment of alien crewmen afflicted with certain diseases
An alien crewman, including an alien crewman ineligible for a conditional permit to land under
section 1282(a) of this title, who is found on arrival in a port of the United States to be afflicted with
any of the disabilities or diseases mentioned in section 1285 of this title, shall be placed in a hospital
designated by the immigration officer in charge at the port of arrival and treated, all expenses
connected therewith, including burial in the event of death, to be borne by the owner, agent,
consignee, commanding officer, or master of the vessel or aircraft, and not to be deducted from the
crewman's wages. No such vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance until such expenses are paid,
or their payment appropriately guaranteed, and the collector of customs is so notified by the
immigration officer in charge. An alien crewman suspected of being afflicted with any such
disability or disease may be removed from the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived to an
immigration station, or other appropriate place, for such observation as will enable the examining
surgeons to determine definitely whether or not he is so afflicted, all expenses connected therewith to
be borne in the manner hereinbefore prescribed. In cases in which it appears to the satisfaction of the
immigration officer in charge that it will not be possible within a reasonable time to effect a cure, the
return of the alien crewman shall be enforced on, or at the expense of, the transportation line on
which he came, upon such conditions as the Attorney General shall prescribe, to insure that the alien
shall be properly cared for and protected, and that the spread of contagion shall be guarded against.

§1284. Control of alien crewmen
(a) Penalties for failure
The owner, agent, consignee, charterer, master, or commanding officer of any vessel or aircraft
arriving in the United States from any place outside thereof who fails (1) to detain on board the
vessel, or in the case of an aircraft to detain at a place specified by an immigration officer at the
expense of the airline, any alien crewman employed thereon until an immigration officer has
completely inspected such alien crewman, including a physical examination by the medical
examiner, or (2) to detain any alien crewman on board the vessel, or in the case of an aircraft at a
place specified by an immigration officer at the expense of the airline, after such inspection unless a
conditional permit to land temporarily has been granted such alien crewman under section 1282 of
this title or unless an alien crewman has been permitted to land temporarily under section 1182(d)(5)
[Release Point 118-106]
or 1283 of this title for medical or hospital treatment, or (3) to remove such alien crewman if
required to do so by an immigration officer, whether such removal requirement is imposed before or
after the crewman is permitted to land temporarily under section 1182(d)(5), 1282, or 1283 of this
title, shall pay to the Commissioner the sum of $3,000 for each alien crewman in respect to whom
any such failure occurs. No such vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance pending the
determination of the liability to the payment of such fine, or while the fine remains unpaid, except
that clearance may be granted prior to the determination of such question upon the deposit of a sum
sufficient to cover such fine, or of a bond with sufficient surety to secure the payment thereof
approved by the Commissioner. The Attorney General may, upon application in writing therefor,
mitigate such penalty to not less than $500 for each alien crewman in respect of whom such failure
occurs, upon such terms as he shall think proper.
(b) Prima facie evidence against transportation line
Except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations issued by the Attorney General, proof that
an alien crewman did not appear upon the outgoing manifest of the vessel or aircraft on which he
arrived in the United States from any place outside thereof, or that he was reported by the master or
commanding officer of such vessel or aircraft as a deserter, shall be prima facie evidence of a failure
to detain or remove such alien crewman.
(c) Removal on other than arriving vessel or aircraft; expenses
If the Attorney General finds that removal of an alien crewman under this section on the vessel or
aircraft on which he arrived is impracticable or impossible, or would cause undue hardship to such
alien crewman, he may cause the alien crewman to be removed from the port of arrival or any other
port on another vessel or aircraft of the same transportation line, unless the Attorney General finds
this to be impracticable. All expenses incurred in connection with such removal, including expenses
incurred in transferring an alien crewman from one place in the United States to another under such
conditions and safeguards as the Attorney General shall impose, shall be paid by the owner or
owners of the vessel or aircraft on which the alien arrived in the United States. The vessel or aircraft
on which the alien arrived shall not be granted clearance until such expenses have been paid or their
payment guaranteed to the satisfaction of the Attorney General. An alien crewman who is transferred
within the United States in accordance with this subsection shall not be regarded as having been
landed in the United States.

dangerous contagious disease. If it appears to the satisfaction of the Attorney General, from an
examination made by a medical officer of the United States Public Health Service, and is so certified
by such officer, that any such alien was so afflicted at the time he was shipped or engaged and taken
on board such vessel or aircraft and that the existence of such affliction might have been detected by
means of a competent medical examination at such time, the owner, commanding officer, agent,
consignee, or master thereof shall pay for each alien so afflicted to the Commissioner the sum of
$1,000. No vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance pending the determination of the question of
the liability to the payment of such sums, or while such sums remain unpaid, except that clearance
may be granted prior to the determination of such question upon the deposit of an amount sufficient
to cover such sums or of a bond approved by the Commissioner with sufficient surety to secure the

§1288. Limitations on performance of longshore work by alien crewmen
(a) In general
For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(D)(i) of this title, the term "normal operation and service on
board a vessel" does not include any activity that is longshore work (as defined in subsection (b)),
except as provided under subsection (c), (d), or (e).
(b) "Longshore work" defined
(1) In general
In this section, except as provided in paragraph (2), the term "longshore work" means any
activity relating to the loading or unloading of cargo, the operation of cargo-related equipment
(whether or not integral to the vessel), and the handling of mooring lines on the dock when the
vessel is made fast or let go, in the United States or the coastal waters thereof.
(2) Exception for safety and environmental protection
The term "longshore work" does not include the loading or unloading of any cargo for which
the Secretary of Transportation has, under the authority contained in chapter 37 of title 46 (relating
to Carriage of Liquid Bulk Dangerous Cargoes), section 1321 of title 33, section 4106 of the Oil
Pollution Act of 1990, or section 5103(b), 5104, 5106, 5107, or 5110 of title 49 prescribed
regulations which govern—
(A) the handling or stowage of such cargo,
(B) the manning of vessels and the duties, qualifications, and training of the officers and crew
of vessels carrying such cargo, and
(C) the reduction or elimination of discharge during ballasting, tank cleaning, handling of
such cargo.
(3) Construction
Nothing in this section shall be construed as broadening, limiting, or otherwise modifying the
meaning or scope of longshore work for purposes of any other law, collective bargaining
agreement, or international agreement.
(c) Prevailing practice exception
(1) Subsection (a) shall not apply to a particular activity of longshore work in and about a local
port if—
(A)(i) there is in effect in the local port one or more collective bargaining agreements each
covering at least 30 percent of the number of individuals employed in performing longshore work
and (ii) each such agreement (covering such percentage of longshore workers) permits the activity
to be performed by alien crewmen under the terms of such agreement; or
(B) there is no collective bargaining agreement in effect in the local port covering at least 30
percent of the number of individuals employed in performing longshore work, and an employer of
[Release Point 118-106]
alien crewmen (or the employer's designated agent or representative) has filed with the Secretary
of Labor at least 14 days before the date of performance of the activity (or later, if necessary due
to an unanticipated emergency, but not later than the date of performance of the activity) an
attestation setting forth facts and evidence to show that—
(i) the performance of the activity by alien crewmen is permitted under the prevailing practice
of the particular port as of the date of filing of the attestation and that the use of alien crewmen
for such activity—
(I) is not during a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute, and
(II) is not intended or designed to influence an election of a bargaining representative for
workers in the local port; and
(ii) notice of the attestation has been provided by the owner, agent, consignee, master, or
commanding officer to the bargaining representative of longshore workers in the local port, or,
where there is no such bargaining representative, notice of the attestation has been provided to
longshore workers employed at the local port.
In applying subparagraph (B) in the case of a particular activity of longshore work consisting of
the use of an automated self-unloading conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated system on a vessel, the
attestation shall be required to be filed only if the Secretary of Labor finds, based on a preponderance
of the evidence which may be submitted by any interested party, that the performance of such
particular activity is not described in clause (i) of such subparagraph.
(2) Subject to paragraph (4), an attestation under paragraph (1) shall—
(A) expire at the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of its filing with the Secretary
of Labor, and
(B) apply to aliens arriving in the United States during such 1-year period if the owner, agent,
consignee, master, or commanding officer states in each list under section 1281 of this title that it
continues to comply with the conditions in the attestation.
(3) An owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer may meet the requirements under
this subsection with respect to more than one alien crewman in a single list.
(4)(A) The Secretary of Labor shall compile and make available for public examination in a timely
manner in Washington, D.C., a list identifying owners, agents, consignees, masters, or commanding
officers which have filed lists for nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(D)(i) of this title
with respect to whom an attestation under paragraph (1) or subsection (d)(1) is made and, for each
such entity, a copy of the entity's attestation under paragraph (1) or subsection (d)(1) (and
accompanying documentation) and each such list filed by the entity.
(B)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and
disposition of complaints respecting an entity's failure to meet conditions attested to, an entity's
misrepresentation of a material fact in an attestation, or, in the case described in the last sentence of
paragraph (1), whether the performance of the particular activity is or is not described in paragraph
(1)(B)(i).
(ii) Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including bargaining
representatives, associations deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties as
determined under regulations of the Secretary).
(iii) The Secretary shall promptly conduct an investigation under this subparagraph if there is
reasonable cause to believe that an entity fails to meet conditions attested to, an entity has
misrepresented a material fact in the attestation, or, in the case described in the last sentence of
paragraph (1), the performance of the particular activity is not described in paragraph (1)(B)(i).
(C)(i) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists to conduct an investigation with
respect to an attestation, a complaining party may request that the activities attested to by the
employer cease during the hearing process described in subparagraph (D). If such a request is made,
the attesting employer shall be issued notice of such request and shall respond within 14 days to the
notice. If the Secretary makes an initial determination that the complaining party's position is
[Release Point 118-106]
supported by a preponderance of the evidence submitted, the Secretary shall require immediately that
the employer cease and desist from such activities until completion of the process described in
subparagraph (D).
(ii) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists to conduct an investigation with
respect to a matter under the last sentence of paragraph (1), a complaining party may request that the
activities of the employer cease during the hearing process described in subparagraph (D) unless the
employer files with the Secretary of Labor an attestation under paragraph (1). If such a request is
made, the employer shall be issued notice of such request and shall respond within 14 days to the
notice. If the Secretary makes an initial determination that the complaining party's position is
supported by a preponderance of the evidence submitted, the Secretary shall require immediately that
the employer cease and desist from such activities until completion of the process described in
subparagraph (D) unless the employer files with the Secretary of Labor an attestation under
paragraph (1).
(D) Under the process established under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall provide, within 180
days after the date a complaint is filed (or later for good cause shown), for a determination as to
whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described in subparagraph (E). The Secretary shall
provide notice of such determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the
complaint within 60 days of the date of the determination.
(E)(i) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an entity has
failed to meet a condition attested to or has made a misrepresentation of material fact in the
attestation, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition,
impose such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to
exceed $5,000 for each alien crewman performing unauthorized longshore work) as the Secretary
determines to be appropriate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Attorney General shall not permit the
vessels owned or chartered by such entity to enter any port of the United States during a period of up
to 1 year.
(ii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that, in the case
described in the last sentence of paragraph (1), the performance of the particular activity is not
described in subparagraph (B)(i), the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and,
thereafter, the attestation described in paragraph (1) shall be required of the employer for the
performance of the particular activity.
(F) A finding by the Secretary of Labor under this paragraph that the performance of an activity by
alien crewmen is not permitted under the prevailing practice of a local port shall preclude for one
year the filing of a subsequent attestation concerning such activity in the port under paragraph (1).
(5) Except as provided in paragraph (5) of subsection (d), this subsection shall not apply to
longshore work performed in the State of Alaska.
(d) State of Alaska exception
(1) Subsection (a) shall not apply to a particular activity of longshore work at a particular location
in the State of Alaska if an employer of alien crewmen has filed an attestation with the Secretary of
Labor at least 30 days before the date of the first performance of the activity (or anytime up to 24
hours before the first performance of the activity, upon a showing that the employer could not have
reasonably anticipated the need to file an attestation for that location at that time) setting forth facts
and evidence to show that—
(A) the employer will make a bona fide request for United States longshore workers who are
qualified and available in sufficient numbers to perform the activity at the particular time and
location from the parties to whom notice has been provided under clauses (ii) and (iii) of
subparagraph (D), except that—
(i) wherever two or more contract stevedoring companies have signed a joint collective
bargaining agreement with a single labor organization described in subparagraph (D)(i), the
employer may request longshore workers from only one of such contract stevedoring
companies, and
(ii) a request for longshore workers to an operator of a private dock may be made only for
longshore work to be performed at that dock and only if the operator meets the requirements of
[Release Point 118-106]
section 932 of title 33;
(B) the employer will employ all those United States longshore workers made available in
response to the request made pursuant to subparagraph (A) who are qualified and available in
sufficient numbers and who are needed to perform the longshore activity at the particular time and
location;
(C) the use of alien crewmembers for such activity is not intended or designed to influence an
election of a bargaining representative for workers in the State of Alaska; and
(D) notice of the attestation has been provided by the employer to—
(i) labor organizations which have been recognized as exclusive bargaining representatives of
United States longshore workers within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act [29
U.S.C. 151 et seq.] and which make available or intend to make available workers to the
particular location where the longshore work is to be performed,
(ii) contract stevedoring companies which employ or intend to employ United States
longshore workers at that location, and
(iii) operators of private docks at which the employer will use longshore workers.
(2)(A) An employer filing an attestation under paragraph (1) who seeks to use alien crewmen to
perform longshore work shall be responsible while at 1 the attestation is valid to make bona fide
requests for United States longshore workers under paragraph (1)(A) and to employ United States
longshore workers, as provided in paragraph (1)(B), before using alien crewmen to perform the
activity or activities specified in the attestation, except that an employer shall not be required to
request longshore workers from a party if that party has notified the employer in writing that it does
not intend to make available United States longshore workers to the location at which the longshore
work is to be performed.
(B) If a party that has provided such notice subsequently notifies the employer in writing that it is
prepared to make available United States longshore workers who are qualified and available in
sufficient numbers to perform the longshore activity to the location at which the longshore work is to
be performed, then the employer's obligations to that party under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of
paragraph (1) shall begin 60 days following the issuance of such notice.
(3)(A) In no case shall an employer filing an attestation be required—
(i) to hire less than a full work unit of United States longshore workers needed to perform the
longshore activity;
(ii) to provide overnight accommodations for the longshore workers while employed; or
(iii) to provide transportation to the place of work, except where—
(I) surface transportation is available;
(II) such transportation may be safely accomplished;
(III) travel time to the vessel does not exceed one-half hour each way; and
(IV) travel distance to the vessel from the point of embarkation does not exceed 5 miles.
(B) In the cases of Wide Bay, Alaska, and Klawock/Craig, Alaska, the travel times and travel
distances specified in subclauses (III) and (IV) of subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be extended to 45
minutes and 7½ miles, respectively, unless the party responding to the request for longshore workers
agrees to the lesser time and distance limitations specified in those subclauses.
(4) Subject to subparagraphs (A) through (D) of subsection (c)(4), attestations filed under
paragraph (1) of this subsection shall—
(A) expire at the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date the employer anticipates the
longshore work to begin, as specified in the attestation filed with the Secretary of Labor, and
(B) apply to aliens arriving in the United States during such 1-year period if the owner, agent,
consignee, master, or commanding officer states in each list under section 1281 of this title that it
continues to comply with the conditions in the attestation.
(5)(A) Except as otherwise provided by subparagraph (B), subsection (c)(3) and subparagraphs
[Release Point 118-106]
(A) through (E) of subsection (c)(4) shall apply to attestations filed under this subsection.
(B) The use of alien crewmen to perform longshore work in Alaska consisting of the use of an
automated self-unloading conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated system on a vessel shall be governed by
the provisions of subsection (c).
(6) For purposes of this subsection—
(A) the term "contract stevedoring companies" means those stevedoring companies licensed to
do business in the State of Alaska that meet the requirements of section 932 of title 33;
(B) the term "employer" includes any agent or representative designated by the employer; and
(C) the terms "qualified" and "available in sufficient numbers" shall be defined by reference to
industry standards in the State of Alaska, including safety considerations.

Subject to the determination of the Secretary of State pursuant to paragraph (2), the Attorney
General shall permit an alien crewman to perform an activity constituting longshore work if—

prohibit such activity by crewmembers aboard United States vessels; and
(B) nationals of a country (or countries) which by law, regulation, or in practice does not
prohibit such activity by crewmembers aboard United States vessels hold a majority of the
ownership interest in the vessel.
(2) Establishment of list
The Secretary of State shall, in accordance with section 553 of title 5, compile and annually
maintain a list, of longshore work by particular activity, of countries where performance of such a
particular activity by crewmembers aboard United States vessels is prohibited by law, regulation,
or in practice in the country. By not later than 90 days after November 29, 1990, the Secretary
shall publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish such list. The Secretary shall first

(2)(A) At the request of any person described in paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall inspect
any facility established, or any method utilized, at a point of entry into the United States by such
person for the purpose of complying with subsection (a). The Attorney General shall approve any

§1323. Unlawful bringing of aliens into United States
(a) Persons liable
(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, including any transportation company, or the owner,
master, commanding officer, agent, charterer, or consignee of any vessel or aircraft, to bring to the
United States from any place outside thereof (other than from foreign contiguous territory) any alien
who does not have a valid passport and an unexpired visa, if a visa was required under this chapter or
regulations issued thereunder.
(2) It is unlawful for an owner, agent, master, commanding officer, person in charge, purser, or
consignee of a vessel or aircraft who is bringing an alien (except an alien crewmember) to the United
States to take any consideration to be kept or returned contingent on whether an alien is admitted to,
or ordered removed from, the United States.
(b) Evidence
[Release Point 118-106]
If it appears to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that any alien has been so brought, such
person, or transportation company, or the master, commanding officer, agent, owner, charterer, or
consignee of any such vessel or aircraft, shall pay to the Commissioner a fine of $3,000 for each
alien so brought and, except in the case of any such alien who is admitted, or permitted to land
temporarily, in addition, an amount equal to that paid by such alien for his transportation from the
initial point of departure, indicated in his ticket, to the port of arrival, such latter fine to be delivered
by the Commissioner to the alien on whose account the assessment is made. No vessel or aircraft
shall be granted clearance pending the determination of the liability to the payment of such fine or
while such fine remains unpaid, except that clearance may be granted prior to the determination of
such question upon the deposit of an amount sufficient to cover such fine, or of a bond with
sufficient surety to secure the payment thereof approved by the Commissioner.
(c) Remission or refund
Except as provided in subsection (e), such fine shall not be remitted or refunded, unless it appears
to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that such person, and the owner, master, commanding
officer, agent, charterer, and consignee of the vessel or aircraft, prior to the departure of the vessel or
aircraft from the last port outside the United States, did not know, and could not have ascertained by
the exercise of reasonable diligence, that the individual transported was an alien and that a valid
passport or visa was required.
(d) Repealed. Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, title III, §308(e)(13), Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009–620
(e) Reduction, refund, or waiver
A fine under this section may be reduced, refunded, or waived under such regulations as the
Attorney General shall prescribe in cases in which—
(1) the carrier demonstrates that it had screened all passengers on the vessel or aircraft in
accordance with procedures prescribed by the Attorney General, or
(2) circumstances exist that the Attorney General determines would justify such reduction,
refund, or waiver.

(2).
Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 104–208, §671(b)(7), made technical amendment to directory language of Pub. L.
103–416, §209(a)(1). See 1994 Amendment note below.
Pub. L. 104–208, §671(b)(6), substituted "remains" for "remain".
Subsec. (d). Pub. L. 104–208, §371(b)(8), substituted "immigration judges" for "special inquiry officers".
Pub. L. 104–208, §308(e)(13), struck out subsec. (d) which read as follows: "The owner, charterer, agent,
consignee, commanding officer, or master of any vessel or aircraft arriving at the United States from any place
outside the United States who fails to deport any alien stowaway on the vessel or aircraft on which such
stowaway arrived or on another vessel or aircraft at the expense of the vessel or aircraft on which such
stowaway arrived when required to do so by an immigration officer, shall pay to the Commissioner a fine of
$3,000 for each alien stowaway, in respect of whom any such failure occurs. Pending final determination of
[Release Point 118-106]
liability for such fine, no such vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance, except that clearance may be
granted upon the deposit of an amount sufficient to cover such fine, or of a bond with sufficient surety to
secure the payment thereof approved by the Commissioner. The provisions of section 1225 of this title for
detention of aliens for examination before immigration judges and the right of appeal provided for in section
1226 of this title shall not apply to aliens who arrive as stowaways and no such alien shall be permitted to land
in the United States, except temporarily for medical treatment, or pursuant to such regulations as the Attorney
General may prescribe for the ultimate departure or removal or deportation of such alien from the United
States."

customs" before "to the alien".
Pub. L. 103–416, §209(a)(1), as amended by Pub. L. 104–208, §671(b)(7), substituted "a fine of $3,000" for
"the sum of $3,000".
Pub. L. 103–416, §209(a)(2), (4), in first sentence substituted "an amount equal to" for "a sum equal to" and
"such latter fine" for "such latter sum", and in second sentence substituted "such fine or while such fine" for
"such sums or while such sums" and "cover such fine" for "cover such sums".
Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 103–416, §209(a)(4), (5), substituted "Except as provided in subsection (e), such fine"
for "Such sums".
Subsec. (d). Pub. L. 103–416, §216, amended first sentence generally. Prior to amendment, first sentence
read as follows: "The owner, charterer, agent, consignee, commanding officer, or master of any vessel or
aircraft arriving at the United States from any place outside thereof who fails to detain on board or at such
other place as may be designated by an immigration officer any alien stowaway until such stowaway has been
inspected by an immigration officer, or who fails to detain such stowaway on board or at such other
designated place after inspection if ordered to do so by an immigration officer, or who fails to deport such
stowaway on the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived or on another vessel or aircraft at the expense of the
vessel or aircraft on which he arrived when required to do so by an immigration officer, shall pay to the
Commissioner the sum of $3,000 for each alien stowaway, in respect of whom any such failure occurs."
Pub. L. 103–416, §209(a)(1), which directed that subsec. (d) be amended by substituting "a fine of $3,000"
for "the sum of $3000", was executed in the first sentence by making the substitution for "the sum of $3,000",
to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
Pub. L. 103–416, §209(a)(3), in second sentence substituted "an amount" for "a sum" before "sufficient to
cover such fine".
Subsec. (e). Pub. L. 103–416, §209(a)(6), added subsec. (e).
1991—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 102–232 substituted "Commissioner" for "collector of customs" before period at
end of second sentence.
1990—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 101–649, §201(b)(1), inserted "a valid passport and" before "an unexpired visa".
Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 101–649, §543(a)(10)(A), substituted "Commissioner the sum of $3,000" for "collector
of customs of the customs district in which the port of arrival is located the sum of $1,000".

by a fine not exceeding $2,000 or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both, for each alien

section, employment (including the usual and normal practices incident to employment) shall not be deemed
to constitute harboring."

1981—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 97–116 strengthened the seizure and forfeiture authority by striking out the
"innocent owner" exemption and merely requiring the Government to show probable cause that the
conveyance seized has been used to illegally transport aliens, which when demonstrated, shifts the burden of
proof to the owner or claimant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the conveyance was not
illegally used, by relieving the Government of the obligation to pay any administrative and incidental costs
incurred by a successful claimant provided probable cause for the original seizure was demonstrated, and by
striking out the requirement that the Government satisfy any valid lien or third party interest in the
conveyance without expense to the interest holder by providing the lienholders interest be satisfied only after
costs associated with the seizure have been deducted.
1978—Subsecs. (b), (c). Pub. L. 95–582 added subsec. (b) and redesignated former subsec. (b) as (c).

§1324a. Unlawful employment of aliens
(a) Making employment of unauthorized aliens unlawful
(1) In general
It is unlawful for a person or other entity—
(A) to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien
knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien (as defined in subsection (h)(3)) with respect to such
employment, or
(B)(i) to hire for employment in the United States an individual without complying with the
requirements of subsection (b) or (ii) if the person or entity is an agricultural association,
agricultural employer, or farm labor contractor (as defined in section 1802 of title 29), to hire,
or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an individual without
complying with the requirements of subsection (b).
(2) Continuing employment
It is unlawful for a person or other entity, after hiring an alien for employment in accordance
with paragraph (1), to continue to employ the alien in the United States knowing the alien is (or
has become) an unauthorized alien with respect to such employment.
(3) Defense
A person or entity that establishes that it has complied in good faith with the requirements of
subsection (b) with respect to the hiring, recruiting, or referral for employment of an alien in the
United States has established an affirmative defense that the person or entity has not violated
paragraph (1)(A) with respect to such hiring, recruiting, or referral.
(4) Use of labor through contract
For purposes of this section, a person or other entity who uses a contract, subcontract, or
exchange, entered into, renegotiated, or extended after November 6, 1986, to obtain the labor of an
alien in the United States knowing that the alien is an unauthorized alien (as defined in subsection
(h)(3)) with respect to performing such labor, shall be considered to have hired the alien for
employment in the United States in violation of paragraph (1)(A).
(5) Use of State employment agency documentation
For purposes of paragraphs (1)(B) and (3), a person or entity shall be deemed to have complied
with the requirements of subsection (b) with respect to the hiring of an individual who was
referred for such employment by a State employment agency (as defined by the Attorney
General), if the person or entity has and retains (for the period and in the manner described in
subsection (b)(3)) appropriate documentation of such referral by that agency, which
documentation certifies that the agency has complied with the procedures specified in subsection
(b) with respect to the individual's referral.
(6) Treatment of documentation for certain employees
(A) In general
For purposes of this section, if—
(i) an individual is a member of a collective-bargaining unit and is employed, under a
[Release Point 118-106]
collective bargaining agreement entered into between one or more employee organizations
and an association of two or more employers, by an employer that is a member of such
association, and
(ii) within the period specified in subparagraph (B), another employer that is a member of
the association (or an agent of such association on behalf of the employer) has complied with
the requirements of subsection (b) with respect to the employment of the individual,
the subsequent employer shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of subsection
(b) with respect to the hiring of the employee and shall not be liable for civil penalties described
in subsection (e)(5).
(B) Period
The period described in this subparagraph is 3 years, or, if less, the period of time that the
individual is authorized to be employed in the United States.
(C) Liability
(i) In general
If any employer that is a member of an association hires for employment in the United
States an individual and relies upon the provisions of subparagraph (A) to comply with the
requirements of subsection (b) and the individual is an alien not authorized to work in the
United States, then for the purposes of paragraph (1)(A), subject to clause (ii), the employer
shall be presumed to have known at the time of hiring or afterward that the individual was an
alien not authorized to work in the United States.
(ii) Rebuttal of presumption
The presumption established by clause (i) may be rebutted by the employer only through
the presentation of clear and convincing evidence that the employer did not know (and could
not reasonably have known) that the individual at the time of hiring or afterward was an alien
not authorized to work in the United States.
(iii) Exception
Clause (i) shall not apply in any prosecution under subsection (f)(1).
(7) Application to Federal Government
For purposes of this section, the term "entity" includes an entity in any branch of the Federal
Government.
(b) Employment verification system
The requirements referred to in paragraphs (1)(B) and (3) of subsection (a) are, in the case of a
person or other entity hiring, recruiting, or referring an individual for employment in the United
States, the requirements specified in the following three paragraphs:
(1) Attestation after examination of documentation
(A) In general
The person or entity must attest, under penalty of perjury and on a form designated or
established by the Attorney General by regulation, that it has verified that the individual is not
an unauthorized alien by examining—
(i) a document described in subparagraph (B), or
(ii) a document described in subparagraph (C) and a document described in subparagraph
(D).
Such attestation may be manifested by either a hand-written or an electronic signature. A person
or entity has complied with the requirement of this paragraph with respect to examination of a
document if the document reasonably appears on its face to be genuine. If an individual
provides a document or combination of documents that reasonably appears on its face to be
[Release Point 118-106]
genuine and that is sufficient to meet the requirements of the first sentence of this paragraph,
nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring the person or entity to solicit the
production of any other document or as requiring the individual to produce such another
document.
(B) Documents establishing both employment authorization and identity
A document described in this subparagraph is an individual's—
(i) United States passport; 1
(ii) resident alien card, alien registration card, or other document designated by the
Attorney General, if the document—
(I) contains a photograph of the individual and such other personal identifying
information relating to the individual as the Attorney General finds, by regulation,
sufficient for purposes of this subsection,
(II) is evidence of authorization of employment in the United States, and
(III) contains security features to make it resistant to tampering, counterfeiting, and
fraudulent use.
(C) Documents evidencing employment authorization
A document described in this subparagraph is an individual's—
(i) social security account number card (other than such a card which specifies on the face
that the issuance of the card does not authorize employment in the United States); or
(ii) other documentation evidencing authorization of employment in the United States
which the Attorney General finds, by regulation, to be acceptable for purposes of this section.
(D) Documents establishing identity of individual
A document described in this subparagraph is an individual's—
(i) driver's license or similar document issued for the purpose of identification by a State, if
it contains a photograph of the individual or such other personal identifying information
relating to the individual as the Attorney General finds, by regulation, sufficient for purposes
of this section; or
(ii) in the case of individuals under 16 years of age or in a State which does not provide for
issuance of an identification document (other than a driver's license) referred to in clause (i),
documentation of personal identity of such other type as the Attorney General finds, by
regulation, provides a reliable means of identification.
(E) Authority to prohibit use of certain documents
If the Attorney General finds, by regulation, that any document described in subparagraph
(B), (C), or (D) as establishing employment authorization or identity does not reliably establish
such authorization or identity or is being used fraudulently to an unacceptable degree, the
Attorney General may prohibit or place conditions on its use for purposes of this subsection.
(2) Individual attestation of employment authorization
The individual must attest, under penalty of perjury on the form designated or established for
purposes of paragraph (1), that the individual is a citizen or national of the United States, an alien
lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or an alien who is authorized under this chapter or by
the Attorney General to be hired, recruited, or referred for such employment. Such attestation may
be manifested by either a hand-written or an electronic signature.
(3) Retention of verification form
After completion of such form in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2), the person or entity
must retain a paper, microfiche, microfilm, or electronic version of the form and make it available
for inspection by officers of the Service, the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair
Employment Practices, or the Department of Labor during a period beginning on the date of the
hiring, recruiting, or referral of the individual and ending—
(A) in the case of the recruiting or referral for a fee (without hiring) of an individual, three
years after the date of the recruiting or referral, and
[Release Point 118-106]
(B) in the case of the hiring of an individual—
(i) three years after the date of such hiring, or
(ii) one year after the date the individual's employment is terminated,
whichever is later.
(4) Copying of documentation permitted
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the person or entity may copy a document
presented by an individual pursuant to this subsection and may retain the copy, but only (except as
otherwise permitted under law) for the purpose of complying with the requirements of this
subsection.
(5) Limitation on use of attestation form
A form designated or established by the Attorney General under this subsection and any
information contained in or appended to such form, may not be used for purposes other than for
enforcement of this chapter and sections 1001, 1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18.
(6) Good faith compliance
(A) In general
Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), a person or entity is considered to have
complied with a requirement of this subsection notwithstanding a technical or procedural failure
to meet such requirement if there was a good faith attempt to comply with the requirement.
(B) Exception if failure to correct after notice
Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if—
(i) the Service (or another enforcement agency) has explained to the person or entity the
basis for the failure,
(ii) the person or entity has been provided a period of not less than 10 business days
(beginning after the date of the explanation) within which to correct the failure, and
(iii) the person or entity has not corrected the failure voluntarily within such period.
(C) Exception for pattern or practice violators
Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a person or entity that has or is engaging in a pattern or
practice of violations of subsection (a)(1)(A) or (a)(2).
(c) No authorization of national identification cards
Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize, directly or indirectly, the issuance or use of
national identification cards or the establishment of a national identification card.
(d) Evaluation and changes in employment verification system
(1) Presidential monitoring and improvements in system
(A) Monitoring
The President shall provide for the monitoring and evaluation of the degree to which the
employment verification system established under subsection (b) provides a secure system to
determine employment eligibility in the United States and shall examine the suitability of
existing Federal and State identification systems for use for this purpose.
(B) Improvements to establish secure system
To the extent that the system established under subsection (b) is found not to be a secure
system to determine employment eligibility in the United States, the President shall, subject to
paragraph (3) and taking into account the results of any demonstration projects conducted under
paragraph (4), implement such changes in (including additions to) the requirements of
subsection (b) as may be necessary to establish a secure system to determine employment
eligibility in the United States. Such changes in the system may be implemented only if the
changes conform to the requirements of paragraph (2).
[Release Point 118-106]
(2) Restrictions on changes in system
Any change the President proposes to implement under paragraph (1) in the verification system
must be designed in a manner so the verification system, as so changed, meets the following
requirements:
(A) Reliable determination of identity
The system must be capable of reliably determining whether—
(i) a person with the identity claimed by an employee or prospective employee is eligible
to work, and
(ii) the employee or prospective employee is claiming the identity of another individual.
(B) Using of counterfeit-resistant documents
If the system requires that a document be presented to or examined by an employer, the
document must be in a form which is resistant to counterfeiting and tampering.
(C) Limited use of system
Any personal information utilized by the system may not be made available to Government
agencies, employers, and other persons except to the extent necessary to verify that an
individual is not an unauthorized alien.
(D) Privacy of information
The system must protect the privacy and security of personal information and identifiers
utilized in the system.
(E) Limited denial of verification
A verification that an employee or prospective employee is eligible to be employed in the
United States may not be withheld or revoked under the system for any reason other than that
the employee or prospective employee is an unauthorized alien.
(F) Limited use for law enforcement purposes
The system may not be used for law enforcement purposes, other than for enforcement of this
chapter or sections 1001, 1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18.
(G) Restriction on use of new documents
If the system requires individuals to present a new card or other document (designed
specifically for use for this purpose) at the time of hiring, recruitment, or referral, then such
document may not be required to be presented for any purpose other than under this chapter (or
enforcement of sections 1001, 1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18) nor to be carried on one's
person.
(3) Notice to Congress before implementing changes
(A) In general
The President may not implement any change under paragraph (1) unless at least—
(i) 60 days,
(ii) one year, in the case of a major change described in subparagraph (D)(iii), or
(iii) two years, in the case of a major change described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph

the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on the
Judiciary of the Senate a written report setting forth the proposed change. If the President
proposes to make any change regarding social security account number cards, the President
shall transmit to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and to the
Committee on Finance of the Senate a written report setting forth the proposed change. The
President promptly shall cause to have printed in the Federal Register the substance of any
major change (described in subparagraph (D)) proposed and reported to Congress.
[Release Point 118-106]
(B) Contents of report
In any report under subparagraph (A) the President shall include recommendations for the
establishment of civil and criminal sanctions for unauthorized use or disclosure of the
information or identifiers contained in such system.
(C) Congressional review of major changes
(i) Hearings and review
The Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate shall
cause to have printed in the Congressional Record the substance of any major change
described in subparagraph (D), shall hold hearings respecting the feasibility and desirability
of implementing such a change, and, within the two year period before implementation, shall
report to their respective Houses findings on whether or not such a change should be
implemented.
(ii) Congressional action
No major change may be implemented unless the Congress specifically provides, in an
appropriations or other Act, for funds for implementation of the change.
(D) Major changes defined
As used in this paragraph, the term "major change" means a change which would—
(i) require an individual to present a new card or other document (designed specifically for
use for this purpose) at the time of hiring, recruitment, or referral,
(ii) provide for a telephone verification system under which an employer, recruiter, or
referrer must transmit to a Federal official information concerning the immigration status of
prospective employees and the official transmits to the person, and the person must record, a
verification code, or
(iii) require any change in any card used for accounting purposes under the Social Security
Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], including any change requiring that the only social security
account number cards which may be presented in order to comply with subsection
(b)(1)(C)(i) are such cards as are in a counterfeit-resistant form consistent with the second
sentence of section 205(c)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 405(c)(2)(D)].
(E) General revenue funding of social security card changes
Any costs incurred in developing and implementing any change described in subparagraph

$1,000 for each individual with respect to whom such violation occurred. In determining the
amount of the penalty, due consideration shall be given to the size of the business of the employer

individual was an unauthorized alien, and the history of previous violations.

With respect to a violation of subsection (g)(1), the order under this subsection may provide for
the remedy described in subsection (g)(2).

regulation to exercise review authority over the decision and order modifies or vacates the
decision and order, or (B) within 30 days of the date of such a modification or vacation (or within
60 days of the date of decision and order of an administrative law judge if not so modified or
vacated) the decision and order is referred to the Attorney General pursuant to regulations, in
which case the decision and order of the Attorney General shall become the final agency decision
and order under this subsection. The Attorney General may not delegate the Attorney General's
authority under this paragraph to any entity which has review authority over immigration-related
matters.
(8) Judicial review
A person or entity adversely affected by a final order respecting an assessment may, within 45
days after the date the final order is issued, file a petition in the Court of Appeals for the
appropriate circuit for review of the order.
(9) Enforcement of orders
If a person or entity fails to comply with a final order issued under this subsection against the
person or entity, the Attorney General shall file a suit to seek compliance with the order in any
appropriate district court of the United States. In any such suit, the validity and appropriateness of
the final order shall not be subject to review.

or (a)(2) shall be fined not more than $3,000 for each unauthorized alien with respect to whom
such a violation occurs, imprisoned for not more than six months for the entire pattern or practice,
or both, notwithstanding the provisions of any other Federal law relating to fine levels.

Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that a person or entity is
engaged in a pattern or practice of employment, recruitment, or referral in violation of paragraph
(1)(A) or (2) of subsection (a), the Attorney General may bring a civil action in the appropriate
district court of the United States requesting such relief, including a permanent or temporary
[Release Point 118-106]
injunction, restraining order, or other order against the person or entity, as the Attorney General
deems necessary.
(g) Prohibition of indemnity bonds
(1) Prohibition
It is unlawful for a person or other entity, in the hiring, recruiting, or referring for employment
of any individual, to require the individual to post a bond or security, to pay or agree to pay an
amount, or otherwise to provide a financial guarantee or indemnity, against any potential liability
arising under this section relating to such hiring, recruiting, or referring of the individual.
(2) Civil penalty
Any person or entity which is determined, after notice and opportunity for an administrative
hearing under subsection (e), to have violated paragraph (1) shall be subject to a civil penalty of
$1,000 for each violation and to an administrative order requiring the return of any amounts
received in violation of such paragraph to the employee or, if the employee cannot be located, to
the general fund of the Treasury.
(h) Miscellaneous provisions
(1) Documentation
In providing documentation or endorsement of authorization of aliens (other than aliens
lawfully admitted for permanent residence) authorized to be employed in the United States, the
Attorney General shall provide that any limitations with respect to the period or type of
employment or employer shall be conspicuously stated on the documentation or endorsement.
(2) Preemption
The provisions of this section preempt any State or local law imposing civil or criminal
sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or
refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.
(3) Definition of unauthorized alien
As used in this section, the term "unauthorized alien" means, with respect to the employment of

individual (and the individual shall provide) and shall record on the I–9 or similar form—
"(A) the individual's social security account number, if the individual has been issued such a
number, and
"(B) if the individual does not attest to United States citizenship under section 274A(b)(2), such
identification or authorization number established by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for the
alien as the Secretary of Homeland Security shall specify,
and shall retain the original form and make it available for inspection for the period and in the
manner required of I–9 forms under section 274A(b)(3).
[Release Point 118-106]
"(2) PRESENTATION OF DOCUMENTATION.—
"(A) IN GENERAL.—The person or other entity, and the individual whose identity and
employment eligibility are being confirmed, shall, subject to subparagraph (B), fulfill the requirements of
section 274A(b) with the following modifications:
"(i) A document referred to in section 274A(b)(1)(B)(ii) (as redesignated by section 412(a)
of this division) must be designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security as suitable for the purpose
of identification in a pilot program.
"(ii) A document referred to in section 274A(b)(1)(D) must contain a photograph of the
individual.
"(iii) The person or other entity has complied with the requirements of section 274A(b)(1)
with respect to examination of a document if the document reasonably appears on its face to be
genuine and it reasonably appears to pertain to the individual whose identity and work eligibility is
being confirmed.
"(B) LIMITATION OF REQUIREMENT TO EXAMINE DOCUMENTATION.—If the
Secretary of Homeland Security finds that a pilot program would reliably determine with respect to an
individual whether—
"(i) the person with the identity claimed by the individual is authorized to work in the United
States, and
"(ii) the individual is claiming the identity of another person,
if a person or entity could fulfill the requirement to examine documentation contained in
subparagraph (A) of section 274A(b)(1) by examining a document specified in either subparagraph
(B) or (D) of such section, the Secretary of Homeland Security may provide that, for purposes of
such requirement, only such a document need be examined. In such case, any reference in section
274A(b)(1)(A) to a verification that an individual is not an unauthorized alien shall be deemed to be
a verification of the individual's identity.
"(3) SEEKING CONFIRMATION.—
"(A) IN GENERAL.—The person or other entity shall make an inquiry, as provided in section
404(a)(1) of this division, using the confirmation system to seek confirmation of the identity and
employment eligibility of an individual, by not later than the end of 3 working days (as specified by the
Secretary of Homeland Security) after the date of the hiring (or recruitment or referral, as the case may
be).
"(B) EXTENSION OF TIME PERIOD.—If the person or other entity in good faith attempts to
make an inquiry during such 3 working days and the confirmation system has registered that not all
inquiries were received during such time, the person or entity can make an inquiry in the first subsequent
working day in which the confirmation system registers that it has received all inquiries. If the
confirmation system cannot receive inquiries at all times during a day, the person or entity merely has to
assert that the entity attempted to make the inquiry on that day for the previous sentence to apply to such
an inquiry, and does not have to provide any additional proof concerning such inquiry.
"(4) CONFIRMATION OR NONCONFIRMATION.—
"(A) CONFIRMATION UPON INITIAL INQUIRY.—If the person or other entity receives an
appropriate confirmation of an individual's identity and work eligibility under the confirmation system
within the time period specified under section 404(b) of this division, the person or entity shall record on
the I–9 or similar form an appropriate code that is provided under the system and that indicates a final
confirmation of such identity and work eligibility of the individual.
"(B) NONCONFIRMATION UPON INITIAL INQUIRY AND SECONDARY
VERIFICATION.—
"(i) NONCONFIRMATION.—If the person or other entity receives a tentative
nonconfirmation of an individual's identity or work eligibility under the confirmation system within
the time period specified under 404(b) of this division, the person or entity shall so inform the
individual for whom the confirmation is sought.
"(ii) NO CONTEST.—If the individual does not contest the nonconfirmation within the time
period specified in section 404(c) of this division, the nonconfirmation shall be considered final. The
person or entity shall then record on the I–9 or similar form an appropriate code which has been
provided under the system to indicate a tentative nonconfirmation.
"(iii) CONTEST.—If the individual does contest the nonconfirmation, the individual shall
utilize the process for secondary verification provided under section 404(c) of this division. The
nonconfirmation will remain tentative until a final confirmation or nonconfirmation is provided by the
confirmation system within the time period specified in such section. In no case shall an employer
[Release Point 118-106]
terminate employment of an individual because of a failure of the individual to have identity and work
eligibility confirmed under this section until a nonconfirmation becomes final. Nothing in this clause
shall apply to a termination of employment for any reason other than because of such a failure.
"(iv) RECORDING OF CONCLUSION ON FORM.—If a final confirmation or
nonconfirmation is provided by the confirmation system under section 404(c) of this division
regarding an individual, the person or entity shall record on the I–9 or similar form an appropriate code
that is provided under the system and that indicates a confirmation or nonconfirmation of identity and
work eligibility of the individual.
"(C) CONSEQUENCES OF NONCONFIRMATION.—
"(i) TERMINATION OR NOTIFICATION OF CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT.—If the
person or other entity has received a final nonconfirmation regarding an individual under subparagraph
(B), the person or entity may terminate employment (or recruitment or referral) of the individual. If the
person or entity does not terminate employment (or recruitment or referral) of the individual, the
person or entity shall notify the Secretary of Homeland Security of such fact through the confirmation
system or in such other manner as the Secretary of Homeland Security may specify.
"(ii) FAILURE TO NOTIFY.—If the person or entity fails to provide notice with respect to
an individual as required under clause (i), the failure is deemed to constitute a violation of section
274A(a)(1)(B) with respect to that individual and the applicable civil monetary penalty under section
274A(e)(5) shall be (notwithstanding the amounts specified in such section) no less than $500 and no
more than $1,000 for each individual with respect to whom such violation occurred.
"(iii) CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT AFTER FINAL NONCONFIRMATION.—If the
person or other entity continues to employ (or to recruit or refer) an individual after receiving final
nonconfirmation, a rebuttable presumption is created that the person or entity has violated section
274A(a)(1)(A). The previous sentence shall not apply in any prosecution under section 274A(f)(1).
"(b) CITIZEN ATTESTATION PILOT PROGRAM.—
"(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in paragraphs (3) through (5), the procedures applicable

"(i) contains a photograph of the individual involved, and
"(ii) has been determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security to have security features,
and to have been issued through application and issuance procedures, which make such document
sufficiently resistant to counterfeiting, tampering, and fraudulent use that it is a reliable means of
identification for purposes of this section.
"(B) AUTHORIZATION TO LIMIT EMPLOYER PARTICIPATION.—The Secretary of
Homeland Security may restrict the number of persons or other entities that may elect to participate in the
citizen attestation pilot program under this subsection as the Secretary of Homeland Security determines
to be necessary to produce a representative sample of employers and to reduce the potential impact of
fraud.
"(3) NO CONFIRMATION REQUIRED FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS ATTESTING TO U.S.
CITIZENSHIP.—In the case of a person or other entity hiring (or recruiting or referring) an individual
under the citizen attestation pilot program, if the individual attests to United States citizenship (under
penalty of perjury on an I–9 or similar form which form states on its face the criminal and other penalties
provided under law for a false representation of United States citizenship)—
"(A) the person or entity may fulfill the requirement to examine documentation contained in
subparagraph (A) of section 274A(b)(1) by examining a document specified in either subparagraph (B)(i)
or (D) of such section; and
"(B) the person or other entity is not required to comply with respect to such individual with the
procedures described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (a), but only if the person or entity retains
the form and makes it available for inspection in the same manner as in the case of an I–9 form under
section 274A(b)(3).

under this paragraph, if an individual being hired (or recruited or referred) attests (in the manner
described in paragraph (3)) to United States citizenship and the person or entity retains the form on which
the attestation is made and makes it available for inspection in the same manner as in the case of an I–9
form under section 274A(b)(3), the person or entity is not required to comply with the procedures
described in section 274A(b).
"(B) RESTRICTION.—The Secretary of Homeland Security shall restrict the election under this
paragraph to no more than 1,000 employers and, to the extent practicable, shall select among employers
seeking to make such election in a manner that provides for such an election by a representative sample
of employers.
"(5) NONREVIEWABLE DETERMINATIONS.—The determinations of the Secretary of Homeland
Security under paragraphs (2) and (4) are within the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security and
are not subject to judicial or administrative review.
"(c) MACHINE-READABLE-DOCUMENT PILOT PROGRAM.—
"(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in paragraph (3), the procedures applicable under the
machine-readable-document pilot program under this subsection shall be the same procedures as those
under the E-Verify Program under subsection (a).
"(2) STATE DOCUMENT REQUIREMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN PILOT PROGRAM.—The
Secretary of Homeland Security may not provide for the operation of the machine-readable-document pilot
program in a State unless driver's licenses and similar identification documents described in section
274A(b)(1)(D)(i) issued by the State include a machine-readable social security account number.
"(3) USE OF MACHINE-READABLE DOCUMENTS.—If the individual whose identity and
employment eligibility must be confirmed presents to the person or entity hiring (or recruiting or referring)
the individual a license or other document described in paragraph (2) that includes a machine-readable
social security account number, the person or entity must make an inquiry through the confirmation system
by using a machine-readable feature of such document. If the individual does not attest to United States
citizenship under section 274A(b)(2), the individual's identification or authorization number described in
subsection (a)(1)(B) shall be provided as part of the inquiry.
"(d) PROTECTION FROM LIABILITY FOR ACTIONS TAKEN ON THE BASIS OF INFORMATION
PROVIDED BY THE CONFIRMATION SYSTEM.—No person or entity participating in a pilot program

provided through the confirmation system.
"SEC. 404. EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY CONFIRMATION SYSTEM.

system through which the Secretary of Homeland Security (or a designee of the Secretary of Homeland
Security, which may be a nongovernmental entity)—
"(1) responds to inquiries made by electing persons and other entities (including those made by the
transmittal of data from machine-readable documents under the machine-readable pilot program) at any
time through a toll-free telephone line or other toll-free electronic media concerning an individual's identity
and whether the individual is authorized to be employed, and
"(2) maintains records of the inquiries that were made, of confirmations provided (or not provided),
and of the codes provided to inquirers as evidence of their compliance with their obligations under the pilot
programs.
To the extent practicable, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall seek to establish such a system using one
or more nongovernmental entities.
"(b) INITIAL RESPONSE.—The confirmation system shall provide confirmation or a tentative
nonconfirmation of an individual's identity and employment eligibility within 3 working days of the initial
inquiry. If providing confirmation or tentative nonconfirmation, the confirmation system shall provide an
appropriate code indicating such confirmation or such nonconfirmation.
"(c) SECONDARY VERIFICATION PROCESS IN CASE OF TENTATIVE NONCONFIRMATION.—In
cases of tentative nonconfirmation, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall specify, in consultation with the
Commissioner of Social Security and the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, an
available secondary verification process to confirm the validity of information provided and to provide a final
confirmation or nonconfirmation within 10 working days after the date of the tentative nonconfirmation.
When final confirmation or nonconfirmation is provided, the confirmation system shall provide an appropriate
code indicating such confirmation or nonconfirmation.
"(d) DESIGN AND OPERATION OF SYSTEM.—The confirmation system shall be designed and
operated—

underlying information;
"(2) to respond to all inquiries made by such persons and entities on whether individuals are authorized
to be employed and to register all times when such inquiries are not received;
"(3) with appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized
disclosure of personal information; and
"(4) to have reasonable safeguards against the system's resulting in unlawful discriminatory practices
based on national origin or citizenship status, including—
"(A) the selective or unauthorized use of the system to verify eligibility;
"(B) the use of the system prior to an offer of employment; or
"(C) the exclusion of certain individuals from consideration for employment as a result of a
perceived likelihood that additional verification will be required, beyond what is required for most job
applicants.
"(e) RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY.—As part of the
confirmation system, the Commissioner of Social Security, in consultation with the entity responsible for
administration of the system, shall establish a reliable, secure method, which, within the time periods specified

against such information maintained by the Commissioner in order to confirm (or not confirm) the validity of
the information provided regarding an individual whose identity and employment eligibility must be
confirmed, the correspondence of the name and number, and whether the individual has presented a social
security account number that is not valid for employment. The Commissioner shall not disclose or release
social security information (other than such confirmation or nonconfirmation).
"(f) RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMISSIONER OF THE IMMIGRATION AND
NATURALIZATION SERVICE.—As part of the confirmation system, the Commissioner of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, in consultation with the entity responsible for administration of the system, shall
establish a reliable, secure method, which, within the time periods specified under subsections (b) and (c),
compares the name and alien identification or authorization number described in section 403(a)(1)(B) of this
division which are provided in an inquiry against such information maintained by the Commissioner in order
to confirm (or not confirm) the validity of the information provided, the correspondence of the name and
number, and whether the alien is authorized to be employed in the United States.
"(g) UPDATING INFORMATION.—The Commissioners of Social Security and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service shall update their information in a manner that promotes the maximum accuracy and
shall provide a process for the prompt correction of erroneous information, including instances in which it is
brought to their attention in the secondary verification process described in subsection (c).
"(h) LIMITATION ON USE OF THE CONFIRMATION SYSTEM AND ANY RELATED SYSTEMS.—
"(1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, nothing in this subtitle shall be
construed to permit or allow any department, bureau, or other agency of the United States Government to

EXECUTIVE DOCUMENTS
EX. ORD. NO. 12989. ECONOMY AND EFFICIENCY IN GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT
THROUGH COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT
PROVISIONS AND USE OF AN ELECTRONIC EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY
VERIFICATION SYSTEM
Ex. Ord. No. 12989, Feb. 13, 1996, 61 F.R. 6091, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 13286, §19, Feb. 28, 2003,
68 F.R. 10623; Ex. Ord. No. 13465, §§1–6, June 6, 2008, 73 F.R. 33285–33287, provided:
This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Government procurement. Stability
and dependability are important elements of economy and efficiency. A contractor whose workforce is less
stable will be less likely to produce goods and services economically and efficiently than a contractor whose
workforce is more stable. It is the policy of the executive branch to enforce fully the immigration laws of the
United States, including the detection and removal of illegal aliens and the imposition of legal sanctions
against employers that hire illegal aliens. Because of the worksite enforcement policy of the United States and
the underlying obligation of the executive branch to enforce the immigration laws, contractors that employ
illegal aliens cannot rely on the continuing availability and service of those illegal workers, and such
contractors inevitably will have a less stable and less dependable workforce than contractors that do not
employ such persons. Where a contractor assigns illegal aliens to work on Federal contracts, the enforcement
of Federal immigration laws imposes a direct risk of disruption, delay, and increased expense in Federal
contracting. Such contractors are less dependable procurement sources, even if they do not knowingly hire or
knowingly continue to employ unauthorized workers.
Contractors that adopt rigorous employment eligibility confirmation policies are much less likely to face
immigration enforcement actions, because they are less likely to employ unauthorized workers, and they are
therefore generally more efficient and dependable procurement sources than contractors that do not employ
the best available measures to verify the work eligibility of their workforce. It is the policy of the executive
branch to use an electronic employment verification system because, among other reasons, it provides the best
available means to confirm the identity and work eligibility of all employees that join the Federal workforce.
Private employers that choose to contract with the Federal Government should meet the same standard.
I find, therefore, that adherence to the general policy of contracting only with providers that do not
knowingly employ unauthorized alien workers and that have agreed to utilize an electronic employment
verification system designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security to confirm the employment eligibility
of their workforce will promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.
NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal
Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the
United States of America, including subsection 121(a) of title 40 and section 301 of title 3, United States
Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:
[Release Point 118-106]
SECTION 1. (a) It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the
economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting
agencies should not contract with employers that have not complied with section 274A(a)(1)(A) and
274A(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1)(A), 1324a(a)(2)) (the "INA
employment provisions") prohibiting the unlawful employment of aliens.
(b) It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical
and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies may not
enter into contracts with employers that do not use the best available means to confirm the work authorization
of their workforce.
(c) It is the policy of the executive branch to enforce fully the antidiscrimination provisions of the INA.
Nothing in this order relieves employers of antidiscrimination obligations under section 274B of the INA (8
U.S.C. 1324b) or any other law.
(d) All discretion under this order shall be exercised consistent with the policies set forth in this section.
SEC. 2. Contractor, as used in this Executive order, shall have the same meaning as defined in subpart 9.4
of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
SEC. 3. Using the procedures established pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e): (a) the Secretary of Homeland
Security may investigate to determine whether a contractor or an organizational unit thereof is not in
compliance with the INA employment provisions;
(b) the Secretary of Homeland Security shall receive and may investigate complaints by employees of any
entity covered under section 3(a) of this order where such complaints allege noncompliance with the INA
employment provisions; and
(c) the Attorney General shall hold such hearings as are required under 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e) to determine
whether an entity covered under section 3(a) is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions.
SEC. 4. (a) Whenever the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General determines that a
contractor or an organizational unit thereof is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions, the
Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General shall transmit that determination to the appropriate
contracting agency and such other Federal agencies as the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney
General may determine. Upon receipt of such determination from the Secretary of Homeland Security or the
Attorney General, the head of the appropriate contracting agency shall consider the contractor or an
organizational unit thereof for debarment as well as for such other action as may be appropriate in accordance
with the procedures and standards prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
(b) The head of the contracting agency may debar the contractor or an organizational unit thereof based on
the determination of the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General that it is not in compliance
with the INA employment provisions. Such determination shall not be reviewable in the debarment
proceedings.
(c) The scope of the debarment generally should be limited to those organizational units of a Federal
contractor that the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General finds are not in compliance with
the INA employment provisions.
(d) The period of the debarment shall be for 1 year and may be extended for additional periods of 1 year if,
using the procedures established pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e), the Secretary of Homeland Security or the
Attorney General determines that the organizational unit of the Federal contractor continues to be in violation
of the INA employment provisions.
(e) The Administrator of General Services shall list a debarred contractor or an organizational unit thereof
on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs and the contractor
or an organizational unit thereof shall be ineligible to participate in any procurement or nonprocurement
activities.
SEC. 5. (a) Executive departments and agencies that enter into contracts shall require, as a condition of each
contract, that the contractor agree to use an electronic employment eligibility verification system designated
by the Secretary of Homeland Security to verify the employment eligibility of: (i) all persons hired during the
contract term by the contractor to perform employment duties within the United States; and (ii) all persons
assigned by the contractor to perform work within the United States on the Federal contract.
(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security:
(i) shall administer, maintain, and modify as necessary and appropriate the electronic employment
eligibility verification system designated by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section; and
(ii) may establish with respect to such electronic employment verification system:
(A) terms and conditions for use of the system; and
(B) procedures for monitoring the use, failure to use, or improper use of the system.
(c) The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services, and the Administrator of the National
[Release Point 118-106]
Aeronautics and Space Administration shall amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to the extent necessary
and appropriate to implement the debarment responsibility, the employment eligibility verification
responsibility, and other related responsibilities assigned to heads of departments and agencies under this
order.
(d) Except to the extent otherwise specified by law or this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security and
the Attorney General:
(i) shall administer and enforce this order; and
(ii) may, after consultation to the extent appropriate with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor,
the Administrator of General Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, and the heads of such other departments or
agencies as may be appropriate, issue such rules, regulations, or orders, or establish such requirements, as may
be necessary and appropriate to implement this order.
SEC. 6. Each contracting department and agency shall cooperate with and provide such information and
assistance to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General as may be required in the
performance of their respective functions under this order.
SEC. 7. The Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, the
Administrator of General Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
and the heads of contracting departments and agencies may delegate any of their functions or duties under this
order to any officer or employee of their respective departments or agencies.
SEC. 8. (a) This order shall be implemented in a manner intended to minimize the burden on participants in
the Federal procurement process.
(b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with the protection of intelligence and law
enforcement sources, methods, and activities from unauthorized disclosure.
SEC. 9. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) authority granted by law to a department or agency or the head thereof; or
(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budget, administrative, or
legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of
appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural,
enforceable at law or in equity, by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies or entities, its
officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

§1324b. Unfair immigration-related employment practices
(a) Prohibition of discrimination based on national origin or citizenship status
(1) General rule
It is an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a person or other entity to
discriminate against any individual (other than an unauthorized alien, as defined in section
1324a(h)(3) of this title) with respect to the hiring, or recruitment or referral for a fee, of the
individual for employment or the discharging of the individual from employment—
(A) because of such individual's national origin, or
(B) in the case of a protected individual (as defined in paragraph (3)), because of such
individual's citizenship status.
(2) Exceptions
Paragraph (1) shall not apply to—
(A) a person or other entity that employs three or fewer employees,
(B) a person's or entity's discrimination because of an individual's national origin if the
discrimination with respect to that person or entity and that individual is covered under section
703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000e–2], or
(C) discrimination because of citizenship status which is otherwise required in order to
comply with law, regulation, or executive order, or required by Federal, State, or local
government contract, or which the Attorney General determines to be essential for an employer
to do business with an agency or department of the Federal, State, or local government.
(3) "Protected individual" defined
As used in paragraph (1), the term "protected individual" means an individual who—
(A) is a citizen or national of the United States, or
(B) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence, is granted the status of an
alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence under section 1160(a) or 1255a(a)(1) of this
title, is admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or is granted asylum under section
1158 of this title; but does not include (i) an alien who fails to apply for naturalization within
six months of the date the alien first becomes eligible (by virtue of period of lawful permanent
residence) to apply for naturalization or, if later, within six months after November 6, 1986, and
(ii) an alien who has applied on a timely basis, but has not been naturalized as a citizen within 2
years after the date of the application, unless the alien can establish that the alien is actively
pursuing naturalization, except that time consumed in the Service's processing the application
shall not be counted toward the 2-year period.
(4) Additional exception providing right to prefer equally qualified citizens
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, it is not an unfair immigration-related
employment practice for a person or other entity to prefer to hire, recruit, or refer an individual
who is a citizen or national of the United States over another individual who is an alien if the two
individuals are equally qualified.
(5) Prohibition of intimidation or retaliation
It is also an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a person or other entity to
intimidate, threaten, coerce, or retaliate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with
any right or privilege secured under this section or because the individual intends to file or has
filed a charge or a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation,
proceeding, or hearing under this section. An individual so intimidated, threatened, coerced, or
retaliated against shall be considered, for purposes of subsections (d) and (g), to have been
discriminated against.
(6) Treatment of certain documentary practices as employment practices
A person's or other entity's request, for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section
[Release Point 118-106]
1324a(b) of this title, for more or different documents than are required under such section or
refusing to honor documents tendered that on their face reasonably appear to be genuine shall be
treated as an unfair immigration-related employment practice if made for the purpose or with the
intent of discriminating against an individual in violation of paragraph (1).
(b) Charges of violations
(1) In general
Except as provided in paragraph (2), any person alleging that the person is adversely affected
directly by an unfair immigration-related employment practice (or a person on that person's
behalf) or an officer of the Service alleging that an unfair immigration-related employment
practice has occurred or is occurring may file a charge respecting such practice or violation with
the Special Counsel (appointed under subsection (c)). Charges shall be in writing under oath or
affirmation and shall contain such information as the Attorney General requires. The Special
Counsel by certified mail shall serve a notice of the charge (including the date, place, and
circumstances of the alleged unfair immigration-related employment practice) on the person or
entity involved within 10 days.
(2) No overlap with EEOC complaints
No charge may be filed respecting an unfair immigration-related employment practice described
in subsection (a)(1)(A) if a charge with respect to that practice based on the same set of facts has
been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.], unless the charge is dismissed as being outside the scope of
such title. No charge respecting an employment practice may be filed with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission under such title if a charge with respect to such practice based on the
same set of facts has been filed under this subsection, unless the charge is dismissed under this
section as being outside the scope of this section.
(c) Special Counsel
(1) Appointment
The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a Special
Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (hereinafter in this section referred
to as the "Special Counsel") within the Department of Justice to serve for a term of four years. In
the case of a vacancy in the office of the Special Counsel the President may designate the officer
or employee who shall act as Special Counsel during such vacancy.
(2) Duties
The Special Counsel shall be responsible for investigation of charges and issuance of
complaints under this section and in respect of the prosecution of all such complaints before
administrative law judges and the exercise of certain functions under subsection (j)(1).
(3) Compensation
The Special Counsel is entitled to receive compensation at a rate not to exceed the rate now or
hereafter provided for grade GS–17 of the General Schedule, under section 5332 of title 5.
(4) Regional offices
The Special Counsel, in accordance with regulations of the Attorney General, shall establish
such regional offices as may be necessary to carry out his duties.
(d) Investigation of charges
(1) By Special Counsel
The Special Counsel shall investigate each charge received and, within 120 days of the date of
the receipt of the charge, determine whether or not there is reasonable cause to believe that the
charge is true and whether or not to bring a complaint with respect to the charge before an
[Release Point 118-106]
administrative law judge. The Special Counsel may, on his own initiative, conduct investigations
respecting unfair immigration-related employment practices and, based on such an investigation
and subject to paragraph (3), file a complaint before such a judge.
(2) Private actions
If the Special Counsel, after receiving such a charge respecting an unfair immigration-related
employment practice which alleges knowing and intentional discriminatory activity or a pattern or
practice of discriminatory activity, has not filed a complaint before an administrative law judge
with respect to such charge within such 120-day period, the Special Counsel shall notify the
person making the charge of the determination not to file such a complaint during such period and
the person making the charge may (subject to paragraph (3)) file a complaint directly before such
a judge within 90 days after the date of receipt of the notice. The Special Counsel's failure to file
such a complaint within such 120-day period shall not affect the right of the Special Counsel to
investigate the charge or to bring a complaint before an administrative law judge during such
90-day period.
(3) Time limitations on complaints
No complaint may be filed respecting any unfair immigration-related employment practice
occurring more than 180 days prior to the date of the filing of the charge with the Special Counsel.
This subparagraph shall not prevent the subsequent amending of a charge or complaint under
subsection (e)(1).
(e) Hearings
(1) Notice
Whenever a complaint is made that a person or entity has engaged in or is engaging in any such
unfair immigration-related employment practice, an administrative law judge shall have power to
issue and cause to be served upon such person or entity a copy of the complaint and a notice of
hearing before the judge at a place therein fixed, not less than five days after the serving of the
complaint. Any such complaint may be amended by the judge conducting the hearing, upon the
motion of the party filing the complaint, in the judge's discretion at any time prior to the issuance
of an order based thereon. The person or entity so complained of shall have the right to file an
answer to the original or amended complaint and to appear in person or otherwise and give
testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint.
(2) Judges hearing cases
Hearings on complaints under this subsection shall be considered before administrative law
judges who are specially designated by the Attorney General as having special training respecting
employment discrimination and, to the extent practicable, before such judges who only consider
cases under this section.
(3) Complainant as party
Any person filing a charge with the Special Counsel respecting an unfair immigration-related
employment practice shall be considered a party to any complaint before an administrative law
judge respecting such practice and any subsequent appeal respecting that complaint. In the
discretion of the judge conducting the hearing, any other person may be allowed to intervene in
the proceeding and to present testimony.

The testimony taken by the administrative law judge shall be reduced to writing. Thereafter, the

In conducting investigations and hearings under this subsection 1 and in accordance with
[Release Point 118-106]
regulations of the Attorney General, the Special Counsel and administrative law judges shall have
reasonable access to examine evidence of any person or entity being investigated. The
administrative law judges by subpoena may compel the attendance of witnesses and the
production of evidence at any designated place or hearing. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey
a subpoena lawfully issued under this paragraph and upon application of the administrative law
judge, an appropriate district court of the United States may issue an order requiring compliance
with such subpoena and any failure to obey such order may be punished by such court as a
contempt thereof.
(g) Determinations
(1) Order
The administrative law judge shall issue and cause to be served on the parties to the proceeding
an order, which shall be final unless appealed as provided under subsection (i).
(2) Orders finding violations
(A) In general
If, upon the preponderance of the evidence, an administrative law judge determines that any
person or entity named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair
immigration-related employment practice, then the judge shall state his findings of fact and
shall issue and cause to be served on such person or entity an order which requires such person
or entity to cease and desist from such unfair immigration-related employment practice.
(B) Contents of order
Such an order also may require the person or entity—
(i) to comply with the requirements of section 1324a(b) of this title with respect to
individuals hired (or recruited or referred for employment for a fee) during a period of up to
three years;
(ii) to retain for the period referred to in clause (i) and only for purposes consistent with
section 1324a(b)(5) of this title, the name and address of each individual who applies, in

for employment in the United States;

(II) except as provided in subclauses (III) and (IV), in the case of a person or entity
previously subject to a single order under this paragraph, to pay a civil penalty of not less
than $2,000 and not more than $5,000 for each individual discriminated against,
(III) except as provided in subclause (IV), in the case of a person or entity previously
subject to more than one order under this paragraph, to pay a civil penalty of not less than
$3,000 and not more than $10,000 for each individual discriminated against, and

subsection (a)(6), to pay a civil penalty of not less than $100 and not more than $1,000 for
each individual discriminated against;
(v) to post notices to employees about their rights under this section and employers'

1324a of this title about the requirements of this section or such section;

an employee's personnel file; and
(viii) to lift (in an appropriate case) any restrictions on an employee's assignments, work
shifts, or movements.

In providing a remedy under subparagraph (B)(iii), back pay liability shall not accrue from a
[Release Point 118-106]
date more than two years prior to the date of the filing of a charge with the Special Counsel.
Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the individual or individuals
discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable under such
paragraph. No order shall require the hiring of an individual as an employee or the payment to
an individual of any back pay, if the individual was refused employment for any reason other
than discrimination on account of national origin or citizenship status.
(D) Treatment of distinct entities
In applying this subsection in the case of a person or entity composed of distinct, physically
separate subdivisions each of which provides separately for the hiring, recruiting, or referring
for employment, without reference to the practices of, and not under the control of or common
control with, another subdivision, each such subdivision shall be considered a separate person
or entity.
(3) Orders not finding violations
If upon the preponderance of the evidence an administrative law judge determines that the
person or entity named in the complaint has not engaged and is not engaging in any such unfair
immigration-related employment practice, then the judge shall state his findings of fact and shall
issue an order dismissing the complaint.
(h) Awarding of attorney's fees
In any complaint respecting an unfair immigration-related employment practice, an administrative
law judge, in the judge's discretion, may allow a prevailing party, other than the United States, a
reasonable attorney's fee, if the losing party's argument is without reasonable foundation in law and
fact.
(i) Review of final orders
(1) In general
Not later than 60 days after the entry of such final order, any person aggrieved by such final
order may seek a review of such order in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which
the violation is alleged to have occurred or in which the employer resides or transacts business.
(2) Further review
Upon the filing of the record with the court, the jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and
its judgment shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of
the United States upon writ of certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.
(j) Court enforcement of administrative orders
(1) In general
If an order of the agency is not appealed under subsection (i)(1), the Special Counsel (or, if the
Special Counsel fails to act, the person filing the charge) may petition the United States district
court for the district in which a violation of the order is alleged to have occurred, or in which the
respondent resides or transacts business, for the enforcement of the order of the administrative law
judge, by filing in such court a written petition praying that such order be enforced.
(2) Court enforcement order
Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have jurisdiction to make and enter a decree
enforcing the order of the administrative law judge. In such a proceeding, the order of the
administrative law judge shall not be subject to review.
(3) Enforcement decree in original review
If, upon appeal of an order under subsection (i)(1), the United States court of appeals does not
reverse such order, such court shall have the jurisdiction to make and enter a decree enforcing the
order of the administrative law judge.
(4) Awarding of attorney's fees
[Release Point 118-106]
In any judicial proceeding under subsection (i) or this subsection, the court, in its discretion,
may allow a prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of
costs but only if the losing party's argument is without reasonable foundation in law and fact.
(k) Termination dates
(1) This section shall not apply to discrimination in hiring, recruiting, or referring, or discharging
of individuals occurring after the date of any termination of the provisions of section 1324a of this
title, under subsection (l) 2 of that section.
(2) The provisions of this section shall terminate 30 calendar days after receipt of the last report
required to be transmitted under section 1324a(j) 2 of this title if—
(A) the Comptroller General determines, and so reports in such report that—
(i) no significant discrimination has resulted, against citizens or nationals of the United States
or against any eligible workers seeking employment, from the implementation of section 1324a
of this title, or
(ii) such section has created an unreasonable burden on employers hiring such workers; and
(B) there has been enacted, within such period of 30 calendar days, a joint resolution stating in
substance that the Congress approves the findings of the Comptroller General contained in such
report.
The provisions of subsections (m) and (n) 2 of section 1324a of this title shall apply to any joint
resolution under subparagraph (B) in the same manner as they apply to a joint resolution under
subsection (l) 2 of such section.

information respecting the rights and remedies prescribed under this section and under title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.] in connection with unfair immigration-related
employment practices. Such campaign shall be aimed at increasing the knowledge of employers,

year (beginning with fiscal year 1991).

employment, without reference to the practices of, and not under the control of or common control
with, another subdivision, each such subdivision shall be considered a separate person or entity.

(a) In general
Subject to subsection (b), any alien who—
(1) has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed or has departed the United
States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is outstanding, and thereafter
(2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States, unless (A) prior to his
reembarkation at a place outside the United States or his application for admission from foreign
contiguous territory, the Attorney General has expressly consented to such alien's reapplying for
admission; or (B) with respect to an alien previously denied admission and removed, unless such
alien shall establish that he was not required to obtain such advance consent under this chapter or
any prior Act,
shall be fined under title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.
(b) Criminal penalties for reentry of certain removed aliens
Notwithstanding subsection (a), in the case of any alien described in such subsection—

aggravated felony), such alien shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or
both;
(2) whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony,
such alien shall be fined under such title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both;
(3) who has been excluded from the United States pursuant to section 1225(c) of this title
because the alien was excludable under section 1182(a)(3)(B) of this title or who has been
removed from the United States pursuant to the provisions of subchapter V, and who thereafter,
without the permission of the Attorney General, enters the United States, or attempts to do so,
shall be fined under title 18 and imprisoned for a period of 10 years, which sentence shall not run
concurrently with any other sentence.1 or
(4) who was removed from the United States pursuant to section 1231(a)(4)(B) of this title who
thereafter, without the permission of the Attorney General, enters, attempts to enter, or is at any
time found in, the United States (unless the Attorney General has expressly consented to such
alien's reentry) shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned for not more than 10 years, or both.
For the purposes of this subsection, the term "removal" includes any agreement in which an alien
stipulates to removal during (or not during) a criminal trial under either Federal or State law.
(c) Reentry of alien deported prior to completion of term of imprisonment
Any alien deported pursuant to section 1252(h)(2) 2 of this title who enters, attempts to enter, or is
at any time found in, the United States (unless the Attorney General has expressly consented to such
[Release Point 118-106]
alien's reentry) shall be incarcerated for the remainder of the sentence of imprisonment which was
pending at the time of deportation without any reduction for parole or supervised release. Such alien
shall be subject to such other penalties relating to the reentry of deported aliens as may be available
under this section or any other provision of law.
(d) Limitation on collateral attack on underlying deportation order
In a criminal proceeding under this section, an alien may not challenge the validity of the
deportation order described in subsection (a)(1) or subsection (b) unless the alien demonstrates
that—
(1) the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief
against the order;
(2) the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of
the opportunity for judicial review; and
(3) the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.

having authority to examine aliens as to their right to enter or remain in the United States;
(3) within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States, to board and
search for aliens any vessel within the territorial waters of the United States and any railway car,

border to prevent the illegal entry of aliens into the United States;
(4) to make arrests for felonies which have been committed and which are cognizable under any

obtained for his arrest.

referred to in this subsection shall be guilty of perjury and shall be punished as provided by section

cause to suspect that grounds exist for denial of admission to the United States under this chapter
which would be disclosed by such search.
(d) Detainer of aliens for violation of controlled substances laws
In the case of an alien who is arrested by a Federal, State, or local law enforcement official for a

designated by the Attorney General of the arrest and of facts concerning the status of the alien, and

the officer or employee of the Service shall promptly determine whether or not to issue such a

officials, the Attorney General shall effectively and expeditiously take custody of the alien.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section other than paragraph (3) of subsection (a), an

in the United States.

perform a function of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or
detention of aliens in the United States (including the transportation of such aliens across State lines
to detention centers), may carry out such function at the expense of the State or political subdivision
and to the extent consistent with State and local law.
(2) An agreement under this subsection shall require that an officer or employee of a State or

authority under this subsection, or any agreement entered into under this subsection, shall be
considered to be acting under color of Federal authority for purposes of determining the liability, and

paragraph (1)(B)) such information as may be necessary to administer the oath of
allegiance under section 1448(a) of this title, and

If an eligible court has provided notice under paragraph (1)(B), the Attorney General shall
inform each person (residing within the jurisdiction of the court), at the time of the approval of
the person's application for naturalization, of—

Attorney General shall permit the person, at the time of the approval, to choose the court to
which the information will be forwarded for administration of the oath of allegiance under this
section.

oath administration ceremonies.

Subject to subparagraph (C), the Attorney General shall not administer the oath of allegiance

that person.
(C) Waiver of exclusive authority
Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this paragraph, a court may waive exclusive
authority to administer the oath of allegiance under section 1448(a) of this title to a person
under this subsection if the Attorney General has not provided the court with the certification
described in subparagraph (A)(i) within a reasonable time before the date scheduled by the court
for oath administration ceremonies. Upon notification of a court's waiver of jurisdiction, the
Attorney General shall promptly notify the applicant.

for which continuous residence is required for admission to citizenship, immediately preceding the

Immigration determine that an applicant otherwise eligible for naturalization has made an
extraordinary contribution to the national security of the United States or to the conduct of United
States intelligence activities, the applicant may be naturalized without regard to the residence and

no residence within a particular State or district of the Service in the United States shall be required:
Provided, That the applicant has continuously resided in the United States for at least one year prior
to naturalization: Provided further, That the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any alien
described in clauses (i) through (v) of section 1158(b)(2)(A) of this title.
(2) An applicant for naturalization under this subsection may be administered the oath of
allegiance under section 1448(a) of this title by any district court of the United States, without regard

[Release Point 118-106]
application for naturalization is filed for at least three months, and without having been physically
present in the United States for any specified period, if such application is filed while the applicant is

respects with the requirements of this subchapter, except that—
(1) no residence within a State or district of the Service in the United States shall be required;
(2) notwithstanding section 1429 of this title insofar as it relates to deportability, such applicant
may be naturalized immediately if the applicant be then actually in the Armed Forces of the
United States, and if prior to the filing of the application, the applicant shall have appeared before
and been examined by a representative of the Service;
(3) the applicant shall furnish to the Secretary of Homeland Security, prior to any hearing upon
his application, a certified statement from the proper executive department for each period of his
service upon which he relies for the benefits of this section, clearly showing that such service was
honorable and that no discharges from service, including periods of service not relied upon by him
for the benefits of this section, were other than honorable (the certificate or certificates herein
provided for shall be conclusive evidence of such service and discharge); and
(4) notwithstanding any other provision of law, no fee shall be charged or collected from the
applicant for filing the application, or for the issuance of a certificate of naturalization upon being

attachment to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and favorable disposition
toward the good order and happiness of the United States, during such service, shall be proved by

before the person has served honorably for a period or periods aggregating five years. Such ground
for revocation shall be in addition to any other provided by law, including the grounds described in
section 1451 of this title. The fact that the naturalized person was separated from the service under

Nothing in this section precludes an individual described in subsection (a) from submitting a new
set of biometric information, including fingerprints, to the Secretary of Homeland Security with an
application for naturalization. If the Secretary determines that submitting a new set of biometric
information, including fingerprints, would result in more timely and effective adjudication of the

(2) provide the individual with a description of how to submit such biometric information,
including fingerprints.
(c) Cooperation

ABOLITION OF IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE AND TRANSFER OF
FUNCTIONS
For abolition of Immigration and Naturalization Service, transfer of functions, and treatment of related
references, see note set out under section 1551 of this title.
§1448. Oath of renunciation and allegiance
(a) Public ceremony
A person who has applied for naturalization shall, in order to be and before being admitted to
citizenship, take in a public ceremony before the Attorney General or a court with jurisdiction under
section 1421(b) of this title an oath (1) to support the Constitution of the United States; (2) to
renounce and abjure absolutely and entirely all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince,
potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which the applicant was before a subject or citizen; (3) to
support and defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign
and domestic; (4) to bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and (5)(A) to bear arms on behalf of
the United States when required by the law, or (B) to perform noncombatant service in the Armed
Forces of the United States when required by the law, or (C) to perform work of national importance
under civilian direction when required by the law. Any such person shall be required to take an oath
containing the substance of clauses (1) to (5) of the preceding sentence, except that a person who
shows by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that he is
opposed to the bearing of arms in the Armed Forces of the United States by reason of religious
training and belief shall be required to take an oath containing the substance of clauses (1) to (4) and
clauses (5)(B) and (5)(C) of this subsection, and a person who shows by clear and convincing
evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that he is opposed to any type of service in the
Armed Forces of the United States by reason of religious training and belief shall be required to take
an oath containing the substance of said clauses (1) to (4) and clause (5)(C). The term "religious
training and belief" as used in this section shall mean an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme
Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but does not include
essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code. In the case
of the naturalization of a child under the provisions of section 1433 of this title the Attorney General
may waive the taking of the oath if in the opinion of the Attorney General the child is unable to
understand its meaning. The Attorney General may waive the taking of the oath by a person if in the
opinion of the Attorney General the person is unable to understand, or to communicate an
understanding of, its meaning because of a physical or developmental disability or mental
impairment. If the Attorney General waives the taking of the oath by a person under the preceding
sentence, the person shall be considered to have met the requirements of section 1427(a)(3) of this
title with respect to attachment to the principles of the Constitution and well disposition to the good
order and happiness of the United States.
(b) Hereditary titles or orders of nobility
In case the person applying for naturalization has borne any hereditary title, or has been of any of
the orders of nobility in any foreign state, the applicant shall in addition to complying with the
requirements of subsection (a) of this section, make under oath in the same public ceremony in
which the oath of allegiance is administered, an express renunciation of such title or order of
nobility, and such renunciation shall be recorded as a part of such proceedings.
[Release Point 118-106]
(c) Expedited judicial oath administration ceremony
Notwithstanding section 1421(b) of this title, an individual may be granted an expedited judicial
oath administration ceremony or administrative naturalization by the Attorney General upon
demonstrating sufficient cause. In determining whether to grant an expedited judicial oath
administration ceremony, a court shall consider special circumstances (such as serious illness of the
applicant or a member of the applicant's immediate family, permanent disability sufficiently
incapacitating as to prevent the applicant's personal appearance at the scheduled ceremony,
developmental disability or advanced age, or exigent circumstances relating to travel or
employment). If an expedited judicial oath administration ceremony is impracticable, the court shall
refer such individual to the Attorney General who may provide for immediate administrative
naturalization.
(d) Rules and regulations
The Attorney General shall prescribe rules and procedures to ensure that the ceremonies
conducted by the Attorney General for the administration of oaths of allegiance under this section are
public, conducted frequently and at regular intervals, and are in keeping with the dignity of the
occasion.

ABOLITION OF IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE AND TRANSFER OF
FUNCTIONS
For abolition of Immigration and Naturalization Service, transfer of functions, and treatment of related
references, see note set out under section 1551 of this title.
§1451. Revocation of naturalization
(a) Concealment of material evidence; refusal to testify
It shall be the duty of the United States attorneys for the respective districts, upon affidavit
showing good cause therefor, to institute proceedings in any district court of the United States in the
judicial district in which the naturalized citizen may reside at the time of bringing suit, for the
purpose of revoking and setting aside the order admitting such person to citizenship and canceling
the certificate of naturalization on the ground that such order and certificate of naturalization were
illegally procured or were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful
misrepresentation, and such revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such person to
citizenship and such canceling of certificate of naturalization shall be effective as of the original date
of the order and certificate, respectively: Provided, That refusal on the part of a naturalized citizen
within a period of ten years following his naturalization to testify as a witness in any proceeding
before a congressional committee concerning his subversive activities, in a case where such person
has been convicted of contempt for such refusal, shall be held to constitute a ground for revocation
of such person's naturalization under this subsection as having been procured by concealment of a
material fact or by willful misrepresentation. If the naturalized citizen does not reside in any judicial
district in the United States at the time of bringing such suit, the proceedings may be instituted in the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the United States district court in the
judicial district in which such person last had his residence.
(b) Notice to party
The party to whom was granted the naturalization alleged to have been illegally procured or
procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation shall, in any such
proceedings under subsection (a) of this section, have sixty days' personal notice, unless waived by
[Release Point 118-106]
such party, in which to make answers to the petition of the United States; and if such naturalized
person be absent from the United States or from the judicial district in which such person last had his
residence, such notice shall be given either by personal service upon him or by publication in the
manner provided for the service of summons by publication or upon absentees by the laws of the
State or the place where such suit is brought.
(c) Membership in certain organizations; prima facie evidence
If a person who shall have been naturalized after December 24, 1952 shall within five years next
following such naturalization become a member of or affiliated with any organization, membership
in or affiliation with which at the time of naturalization would have precluded such person from
naturalization under the provisions of section 1424 of this title, it shall be considered prima facie
evidence that such person was not attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States
and was not well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States at the time of
naturalization, and, in the absence of countervailing evidence, it shall be sufficient in the proper
proceeding to authorize the revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such person to
citizenship and the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization as having been obtained by
concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation, and such revocation and setting aside
of the order admitting such person to citizenship and such canceling of certificate of naturalization
shall be effective as of the original date of the order and certificate, respectively.
(d) Applicability to citizenship through naturalization of parent or spouse
Any person who claims United States citizenship through the naturalization of a parent or spouse
in whose case there is a revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such parent or spouse to
citizenship under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section on the ground that the order and
certificate of naturalization were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful
misrepresentation shall be deemed to have lost and to lose his citizenship and any right or privilege
of citizenship which he may have, now has, or may hereafter acquire under and by virtue of such
naturalization of such parent or spouse, regardless of whether such person is residing within or
without the United States at the time of the revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such
parent or spouse to citizenship. Any person who claims United States citizenship through the
naturalization of a parent or spouse in whose case there is a revocation and setting aside of the order
admitting such parent or spouse to citizenship and the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization
under the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, or under the provisions of section 1440(c) of
this title on any ground other than that the order and certificate of naturalization were procured by
concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation, shall be deemed to have lost and to
lose his citizenship and any right or privilege of citizenship which would have been enjoyed by such
person had there not been a revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such parent or spouse
to citizenship and the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization, unless such person is residing
in the United States at the time of the revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such parent
or spouse to citizenship and the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization.
(e) Citizenship unlawfully procured
When a person shall be convicted under section 1425 of title 18 of knowingly procuring
naturalization in violation of law, the court in which such conviction is had shall thereupon revoke,
set aside, and declare void the final order admitting such person to citizenship, and shall declare the
certificate of naturalization of such person to be canceled. Jurisdiction is conferred on the courts
having jurisdiction of the trial of such offense to make such adjudication.
(f) Cancellation of certificate of naturalization
Whenever an order admitting an alien to citizenship shall be revoked and set aside or a certificate
of naturalization shall be canceled, or both, as provided in this section, the court in which such
judgment or decree is rendered shall make an order canceling such certificate and shall send a
certified copy of such order to the Attorney General. The clerk of court shall transmit a copy of such
order and judgment to the Attorney General. A person holding a certificate of naturalization or
citizenship which has been canceled as provided by this section shall upon notice by the court by
[Release Point 118-106]
which the decree of cancellation was made, or by the Attorney General, surrender the same to the
Attorney General.
(g) Applicability to certificates of naturalization and citizenship
The provisions of this section shall apply not only to any naturalization granted and to certificates
of naturalization and citizenship issued under the provisions of this subchapter, but to any
naturalization heretofore granted by any court, and to all certificates of naturalization and citizenship
which may have been issued heretofore by any court or by the Commissioner based upon
naturalization granted by any court, or by a designated representative of the Commissioner under the
provisions of section 702 of the Nationality Act of 1940, as amended, or by such designated
representative under any other act.
(h) Power to correct, reopen, alter, modify, or vacate order
Nothing contained in this section shall be regarded as limiting, denying, or restricting the power of
the Attorney General to correct, reopen, alter, modify, or vacate an order naturalizing the person.

action under this subsection may be instituted only within five years after the final administrative

shall be entitled to an appeal to the Secretary of State, who, if he approves the denial, shall state in
writing his reasons for his decision. The Secretary of State shall prescribe rules and regulations for
the issuance of certificates of identity as above provided. The provisions of this subsection shall be

§1522. Authorization for programs for domestic resettlement of and assistance to
refugees
(a) Conditions and considerations
(1)(A) In providing assistance under this section, the Director shall, to the extent of available
appropriations, (i) make available sufficient resources for employment training and placement in
order to achieve economic self-sufficiency among refugees as quickly as possible, (ii) provide
refugees with the opportunity to acquire sufficient English language training to enable them to
become effectively resettled as quickly as possible, (iii) insure that cash assistance is made available
to refugees in such a manner as not to discourage their economic self-sufficiency, in accordance with
subsection (e)(2), and (iv) insure that women have the same opportunities as men to participate in
training and instruction.
(B) It is the intent of Congress that in providing refugee assistance under this section—
[Release Point 118-106]
(i) employable refugees should be placed on jobs as soon as possible after their arrival in the
United States;
(ii) social service funds should be focused on employment-related services,
English-as-a-second-language training (in nonwork hours where possible), and case-management
services; and
(iii) local voluntary agency activities should be conducted in close cooperation and advance
consultation with State and local governments.
(2)(A) The Director and the Federal agency administering subsection (b)(1) shall consult regularly
(not less often than quarterly) with State and local governments and private nonprofit voluntary
agencies concerning the sponsorship process and the intended distribution of refugees among the
States and localities before their placement in those States and localities.
(B) The Director shall develop and implement, in consultation with representatives of voluntary
agencies and State and local governments, policies and strategies for the placement and resettlement
of refugees within the United States.
(C) Such policies and strategies, to the extent practicable and except under such unusual
circumstances as the Director may recognize, shall—
(i) insure that a refugee is not initially placed or resettled in an area highly impacted (as
determined under regulations prescribed by the Director after consultation with such agencies and
governments) by the presence of refugees or comparable populations unless the refugee has a
spouse, parent, sibling, son, or daughter residing in that area,
(ii) provide for a mechanism whereby representatives of local affiliates of voluntary agencies
regularly (not less often than quarterly) meet with representatives of State and local governments
to plan and coordinate in advance of their arrival the appropriate placement of refugees among the
various States and localities, and
(iii) take into account—
(I) the proportion of refugees and comparable entrants in the population in the area,
(II) the availability of employment opportunities, affordable housing, and public and private
resources (including educational, health care, and mental health services) for refugees in the
area,
(III) the likelihood of refugees placed in the area becoming self-sufficient and free from
long-term dependence on public assistance, and
(IV) the secondary migration of refugees to and from the area that is likely to occur.
(D) With respect to the location of placement of refugees within a State, the Federal agency
administering subsection (b)(1) shall, consistent with such policies and strategies and to the
maximum extent possible, take into account recommendations of the State.
(3) In the provision of domestic assistance under this section, the Director shall make a periodic
assessment, based on refugee population and other relevant factors, of the relative needs of refugees
for assistance and services under this subchapter and the resources available to meet such needs. The
Director shall compile and maintain data on secondary migration of refugees within the United
States and, by State of residence and nationality, on the proportion of refugees receiving cash or
medical assistance described in subsection (e). In allocating resources, the Director shall avoid
duplication of services and provide for maximum coordination between agencies providing related
services.
(4)(A) No grant or contract may be awarded under this section unless an appropriate proposal and
application (including a description of the agency's ability to perform the services specified in the
proposal) are submitted to, and approved by, the appropriate administering official. Grants and
contracts under this section shall be made to those agencies which the appropriate administering
official determines can best perform the services. Payments may be made for activities authorized
under this subchapter in advance or by way of reimbursement. In carrying out this section, the
Director, the Secretary of State, and any such other appropriate administering official are
authorized—
[Release Point 118-106]
(i) to make loans, and
(ii) to accept and use money, funds, property, and services of any kind made available by gift,
devise, bequest, grant, or otherwise for the purpose of carrying out this section.
(B) No funds may be made available under this subchapter (other than under subsection (b)(1)) to
States or political subdivisions in the form of block grants, per capita grants, or similar consolidated
grants or contracts. Such funds shall be made available under separate grants or contracts—
(i) for medical screening and initial medical treatment under subsection (b)(5),
(ii) for services for refugees under subsection (c)(1),
(iii) for targeted assistance project grants under subsection (c)(2), and
(iv) for assistance for refugee children under subsection (d)(2).
(C) The Director may not delegate to a State or political subdivision his authority to review or
approve grants or contracts under this subchapter or the terms under which such grants or contracts
are made.
(5) Assistance and services funded under this section shall be provided to refugees without regard
to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion.
(6) As a condition for receiving assistance under this section, a State must—
(A) submit to the Director a plan which provides—
(i) a description of how the State intends to encourage effective refugee resettlement and to
promote economic self-sufficiency as quickly as possible,
(ii) a description of how the State will insure that language training and employment services
are made available to refugees receiving cash assistance,
(iii) for the designation of an individual, employed by the State, who will be responsible for
insuring coordination of public and private resources in refugee resettlement,
(iv) for the care and supervision of and legal responsibility for unaccompanied refugee
children in the State, and
(v) for the identification of refugees who at the time of resettlement in the State are
determined to have medical conditions requiring, or medical histories indicating a need for,
treatment or observation and such monitoring of such treatment or observation as may be
necessary;
(B) meet standards, goals, and priorities, developed by the Director, which assure the effective
resettlement of refugees and which promote their economic self-sufficiency as quickly as possible
and the efficient provision of services; and

report on the uses of funds provided under this subchapter which the State is responsible for
administering.

Secretary of State under subsection (b), shall develop a system of monitoring the assistance provided
under this section. This system shall include—
(A) evaluations of the effectiveness of the programs funded under this section and the
performance of States, grantees, and contractors;
(B) financial auditing and other appropriate monitoring to detect any fraud, abuse, or
mismanagement in the operation of such programs; and
(C) data collection on the services provided and the results achieved.
(8) The Attorney General shall provide the Director with information supplied by refugees in

may issue such regulations as each deems appropriate to carry out this subchapter.

(including initial reception and placement with sponsors) of refugees in the United States. Grants to,
or contracts with, private nonprofit voluntary agencies under this paragraph shall be made consistent
with the objectives of this subchapter, taking into account the different resettlement approaches and
practices of such agencies. Resettlement assistance under this paragraph shall be provided in
coordination with the Director's provision of other assistance under this subchapter. Funds provided
to agencies under such grants and contracts may only be obligated or expended during the fiscal year
in which they are provided (or the subsequent fiscal year or such subsequent fiscal period as the
Federal contracting agency may approve) to carry out the purposes of this subsection.

paragraph, the authority of the Director under the first sentence of subparagraph (A) shall be
exercised by such officer as the President shall from time to time specify.

Secretary of State is authorized to implement such programs with respect to refugees awaiting entry
into the United States.
(3) The Secretary is authorized to make arrangements (including cooperative arrangements with
other Federal agencies) for the temporary care of refugees in the United States in emergency
circumstances, including the establishment of processing centers, if necessary, without regard to such
provisions of law (other than the Renegotiation Act of 1951 and section 1524(b) of this title)
regulating the making, performance, amendment, or modification of contracts and the expenditure of
funds of the United States Government as the Secretary may specify.
(4) The Secretary shall—

applicable medical records; and
(D) provide for such monitoring of refugees identified under subparagraph (B) as will insure
that they receive appropriate and timely treatment.
The Secretary shall develop and implement methods for monitoring and assessing the quality of
medical screening and related health services provided to refugees awaiting resettlement in the
United States.
(5) The Director is authorized to make grants to, and enter into contracts with, State and local
health agencies for payments to meet their costs of providing medical screening and initial medical
treatment to refugees.
(6) The Comptroller General shall directly conduct an annual financial audit of funds expended
under each grant or contract made under paragraph (1) for fiscal year 1986 and for fiscal year 1987.
(7) Each grant or contract with an agency under paragraph (1) shall require the agency to do the

following:
(A) To provide quarterly performance and financial status reports to the Federal agency
administering paragraph (1).
(B)(i) To provide, directly or through its local affiliate, notice to the appropriate county or other
local welfare office at the time that the agency becomes aware that a refugee is offered

(ii) upon request of such a welfare office to which a refugee has applied for cash assistance, to
furnish that office with documentation respecting any cash or other resources provided directly by
the agency to the refugee under this subsection.
(C) To assure that refugees, known to the agency as having been identified pursuant to
paragraph (4)(B) as having medical conditions affecting the public health and requiring treatment,
report to the appropriate county or other health agency upon their resettlement in an area.
(D) To fulfill its responsibility to provide for the basic needs (including food, clothing, shelter,
and transportation for job interviews and training) of each refugee resettled and to develop and

(i) to assist refugees in obtaining the skills which are necessary for economic self-sufficiency,
including projects for job training, employment services, day care, professional refresher training,
and other recertification services;
(ii) to provide training in English where necessary (regardless of whether the refugees are
employed or receiving cash or other assistance); and

(including mental health) services, social services, educational and other services.
(B) The funds available for a fiscal year for grants and contracts under subparagraph (A) shall be
allocated among the States based on the total number of refugees (including children and adults) who
arrived in the United States not more than 36 months before the beginning of such fiscal year and
who are actually residing in each State (taking into account secondary migration) as of the beginning
of the fiscal year.
(C) Any limitation which the Director establishes on the proportion of funds allocated to a State
under this paragraph that the State may use for services other than those described in subsection
(a)(1)(B)(ii) shall not apply if the Director receives a plan (established by or in consultation with
local governments) and determines that the plan provides for the maximum appropriate provision of
employment-related services for, and the maximum placement of, employable refugees consistent
with performance standards established under section 106 of the Job Training Partnership Act.
(2)(A) The Director is authorized to make grants to States for assistance to counties and similar
areas in the States where, because of factors such as unusually large refugee populations (including
secondary migration), high refugee concentrations, and high use of public assistance by refugees,
there exists and can be demonstrated a specific need for supplementation of available resources for
services to refugees.
(B) Grants shall be made available under this paragraph—
(i) primarily for the purpose of facilitating refugee employment and achievement of
self-sufficiency,
(ii) in a manner that does not supplant other refugee program funds and that assures that not less

contracts with public and private nonprofit agencies, for the provision of child welfare services,
including foster care maintenance payments and services and health care, furnished to any refugee
child (except as provided in subparagraph (B)) during the thirty-six month period beginning with the
first month in which such refugee child is in the United States.
(B)(i) In the case of a refugee child who is unaccompanied by a parent or other close adult relative
(as defined by the Director), the services described in subparagraph (A) may be furnished until the
month after the child attains eighteen years of age (or such higher age as the State's child welfare
services plan under part B of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 620 et seq.] prescribes for
the availability of such services to any other child in that State).
(ii) The Director shall attempt to arrange for the placement under the laws of the States of such
unaccompanied refugee children, who have been accepted for admission to the United States, before
(or as soon as possible after) their arrival in the United States. During any interim period while such
[Release Point 118-106]
a child is in the United States or in transit to the United States but before the child is so placed, the
Director shall assume legal responsibility (including financial responsibility) for the child, if
necessary, and is authorized to make necessary decisions to provide for the child's immediate care.
(iii) In carrying out the Director's responsibilities under clause (ii), the Director is authorized to
enter into contracts with appropriate public or private nonprofit agencies under such conditions as the
Director determines to be appropriate.

(e) Cash assistance and medical assistance to refugees
(1) The Director is authorized to provide assistance, reimbursement to States, and grants to, and
contracts with, public or private nonprofit agencies for 100 per centum of the cash assistance and
medical assistance provided to any refugee during the thirty-six month period beginning with the
first month in which such refugee has entered the United States and for the identifiable and
reasonable administrative costs of providing this assistance.
(2)(A) Cash assistance provided under this subsection to an employable refugee is conditioned,
except for good cause shown—
(i) on the refugee's registration with an appropriate agency providing employment services
described in subsection (c)(1)(A)(i), or, if there is no such agency available, with an appropriate
State or local employment service;
(ii) on the refugee's participation in any available and appropriate social service or targeted
assistance program (funded under subsection (c)) providing job or language training in the area in
which the refugee resides; and
(iii) on the refugee's acceptance of appropriate offers of employment.
(B) Cash assistance shall not be made available to refugees who are full-time students in
institutions of higher education (as defined by the Director after consultation with the Secretary of
Education).
(C) In the case of a refugee who—
(i) refuses an offer of employment which has been determined to be appropriate either by the
agency responsible for the initial resettlement of the refugee under subsection (b) or by the
appropriate State or local employment service,
(ii) refuses to go to a job interview which has been arranged through such agency or service, or
(iii) refuses to participate in a social service or targeted assistance program referred to in
subparagraph (A)(ii) which such agency or service determines to be available and appropriate,
cash assistance to the refugee shall be terminated (after opportunity for an administrative hearing)
for a period of three months (for the first such refusal) or for a period of six months (for any
subsequent refusal).
(3) The Director shall develop plans to provide English training and other appropriate services and
training to refugees receiving cash assistance.
(4) If a refugee is eligible for aid or assistance under a State program funded under part A of title
IV or under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq., 1396 et seq.], or for
supplemental security income benefits (including State supplementary payments) under the program
established under title XVI of that Act [42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.], funds authorized under this
subsection shall only be used for the non-Federal share of such aid or assistance, or for such
supplementary payments, with respect to cash and medical assistance provided with respect to such
refugee under this paragraph.
(5) The Director is authorized to allow for the provision of medical assistance under paragraph (1)
to any refugee, during the one-year period after entry, who does not qualify for assistance under a
State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] on account of
any resources or income requirement of such plan, but only if the Director determines that—
(A) this will (i) encourage economic self-sufficiency, or (ii) avoid a significant burden on State
[Release Point 118-106]
and local governments; and
(B) the refugee meets such alternative financial resources and income requirements as the
Director shall establish.
(6) As a condition for receiving assistance, reimbursement, or a contract under this subsection and
notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State or agency must provide assurances that whenever
a refugee applies for cash or medical assistance for which assistance or reimbursement is provided
under this subsection, the State or agency must notify promptly the agency (or local affiliate) which
provided for the initial resettlement of the refugee under subsection (b) of the fact that the refugee
has so applied.
(7)(A) The Secretary shall develop and implement alternative projects for refugees who have been
in the United States less than thirty-six months, under which refugees are provided interim support,
medical services, support services, and case management, as needed, in a manner that encourages
self-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency, and fosters greater coordination among the
resettlement agencies and service providers. The Secretary may permit alternative projects to cover
specific groups of refugees who have been in the United States 36 months or longer if the Secretary
determines that refugees in the group have been significantly and disproportionately dependent on
welfare and need the services provided under the project in order to become self-sufficient and that
their coverage under the projects would be cost-effective.
(B) Refugees covered under such alternative projects shall be precluded from receiving cash or
medical assistance under any other paragraph of this subsection or under title XIX or part A of title
IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., 601 et seq.].
(C) The Secretary shall report to Congress not later than October 31, 1985, on the results of these
projects and on any recommendations respecting changes in the refugee assistance program under
this section to take into account such results.
(D) To the extent that the use of such funds is consistent with the purposes of such provisions,
funds appropriated under section 1524(a) of this title, part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42
U.S.C. 601 et seq.], or title XIX of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.], may be used for the purpose of
implementing and evaluating alternative projects under this paragraph.
(8) In its provision of assistance to refugees, a State or political subdivision shall consider the
recommendations of, and assistance provided by, agencies with grants or contracts under subsection
(b)(1).
(f) Assistance to States and counties for incarceration of certain Cuban nationals; priority for
removal and return to Cuba
(1) The Attorney General shall pay compensation to States and to counties for costs incurred by
the States and counties to confine in prisons, during the fiscal year for which such payment is made,
nationals of Cuba who—
(A) were paroled into the United States in 1980 by the Attorney General,
(B) after such parole committed any violation of State or county law for which a term of
imprisonment was imposed, and
(C) at the time of such parole and such violation were not aliens lawfully admitted to the United
States—
(i) for permanent residence, or
(ii) under the terms of an immigrant or a nonimmigrant visa issued,
under this chapter.
(2) For a State or county to be eligible to receive compensation under this subsection, the chief
executive officer of the State or county shall submit to the Attorney General, in accordance with
rules to be issued by the Attorney General, an application containing—
(A) the number and names of the Cuban nationals with respect to whom the State or county is
entitled to such compensation, and
(B) such other information as the Attorney General may require.
[Release Point 118-106]
(3) For a fiscal year the Attorney General shall pay the costs described in paragraph (1) to each
State and county determined by the Attorney General to be eligible under paragraph (2); except that
if the amounts appropriated for the fiscal year to carry out this subsection are insufficient to cover all
such payments, each of such payments shall be ratably reduced so that the total of such payments
equals the amounts so appropriated.
(4) The authority of the Attorney General to pay compensation under this subsection shall be
effective for any fiscal year only to the extent and in such amounts as may be provided in advance in
appropriation Acts.
(5) It shall be the policy of the United States Government that the President, in consultation with
the Attorney General and all other appropriate Federal officials and all appropriate State and county
officials referred to in paragraph (2), shall place top priority on seeking the expeditious removal from
this country and the return to Cuba of Cuban nationals described in paragraph (1) by any reasonable
and responsible means, and to this end the Attorney General may use the funds authorized to carry
out this subsection to conduct such policy.

be ratably reduced by the same percentage to the extent necessary to bring the aggregate of such allocations
within the limits of the amounts so appropriated.
"(2) In the event that funds become available for making payments under this Act for any period after
allocations have been made under paragraph (1) of this subsection for such period, the amounts reduced under
such paragraph shall be increased on the same basis as they were reduced.
"TREATMENT OF CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS
"SEC. 103. (a) The jurisdictions to which this section applies are Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin
Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
"(b)(1) Each jurisdiction to which this section applies shall be entitled to grants for the purposes set forth in
sections 201(a), 302, and 402 in amounts equal to amounts determined by the Secretary in accordance with
criteria established by the Secretary, except that the aggregate of the amount to which such jurisdictions are so

"(A) for the purposes set forth in section 201(a), shall not exceed an amount equal to 1 percent of the
amount authorized to be appropriated under section 201 for that period;
"(B) for the purposes set forth in section 302, shall not exceed an amount equal to 1 percent of the
aggregate of the amounts to which all States are entitled under section 301 for that period; and

"(2) If the aggregate of the amounts determined by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) to be so needed
for any period exceeds an amount equal to such 1 percent limitation, the entitlement of each such jurisdiction
shall be reduced proportionately until such aggregate does not exceed such limitation.
"STATE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS
"SEC. 104. The Secretary is authorized to pay to each State educational agency amounts equal to the
amounts expended by it for the proper and efficient administration of its functions under this Act, except that
the total of such payments or any period shall not exceed 2 percent of the amount which that State educational
agency receives for that period under this Act.
"WITHHOLDING
"SEC. 105. Whenever the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing to any State
educational agency, finds that there is a failure to meet the requirements of any title of this Act, the Secretary
shall notify that agency that further payments will not be made to the agency under such title, or in the
discretion of the Secretary, that the State educational agency shall not make further payments under such title
to specified local education agencies or other entities (in the case of funds under title IV) whose actions cause
or are involved in such failure until the Secretary is satisfied that there is no longer any such failure to comply.
Until the Secretary is so satisfied, no further payments shall be made to the State educational agency under
such title, or payments by the State educational agency under such title shall be limited to local educational
agencies or other entities (in the case of funds under title IV) whose actions did not cause or were not involved
in the failure, as the case may be.
"CONSULTATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES
"SEC. 106. To the extent that may be appropriate to facilitate the determination of the amount of any
reductions under sections 201(b)(2), 301(b)(3), and 401(b)(2), the Secretary shall consult with the heads of
other agencies providing assistance to eligible participants in order to secure information concerning the
[Release Point 118-106]
disbursement of funds for educational purposes under programs administered by them and provide, wherever
feasible, for coordination among those programs and the programs under titles II through IV of this Act.
"TITLE II—GENERAL ASSISTANCE FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES
"STATE ENTITLEMENTS
"SEC. 201. (a) The Secretary shall, in accordance with the provisions of this title, make grants to State
educational agencies for fiscal year 1981, and for each subsequent fiscal year, for the purposes of assisting
local educational agencies of that State in providing basic education for eligible participants enrolled in
elementary or secondary public schools. Payments made under this title to any State shall be used in
accordance with applications approved under section 202 for public educational services for eligible
participants enrolled in the elementary and secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of the local
educational agencies of that State.
"(b)(1) As soon as possible after the date of the enactment of the Consolidated Refugee Education
Assistance Act [Aug. 13, 1981], the Secretary shall establish a formula (reflecting the availability of the full
amount authorized for this title under section 203(b)) by which to determine the amount of the grant which
each State educational agency is entitled to receive under this title for any fiscal year. The formula established
by the Secretary shall take into account the number of years that an eligible participant assisted under this title
has resided within the United States and the relative costs, by grade level, of providing education for
elementary and secondary school children. On the basis of the formula the Secretary shall allocate among the
State educational agencies, for each fiscal year, the amounts available to carry out this title, subject to such
reductions or adjustments as may be required under paragraph (2) or subsection (c). Funds shall be allocated
among State educational agencies pursuant to the formula without regard to variations in educational costs
among different geographical areas.
"(2) The amount of the grant to which a State educational agency is otherwise entitled for any fiscal year, as
determined under paragraph (1), shall be reduced by the amounts made available for such fiscal year under
any other Federal law for expenditure within the State for the same purposes as those for which funds are
made available under this title, except that the reduction shall be made only to the extent that (A) such
amounts are made available for such purposes specifically because of the refugee, parolee, or asylee status of
the individuals to be served by such funds, and (B) such amounts are made available to provide assistance to
individuals eligible for services under this title. The amount of the reduction required under this paragraph
shall be determined by the Secretary in a manner consistent with subsection (c).
"(3) For the purpose of this subsection, the term 'State' does not include Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin
Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The entitlements of such
jurisdictions shall be determined in the manner specified in section 103, but for purposes of this title and
section 105 any payments made under section 103 for the purposes set forth in section 201(a) shall be
considered to be payments under this title.
"(c) Determinations by the Secretary under this title for any period with respect to the number of eligible
participants and the amount of the reduction under subsection (b)(2) shall be made, whenever actual
satisfactory data are not available, on the basis of estimates. No such determination shall operate because of an
underestimate or overestimate to deprive any State educational agency of its entitlement to any payment (or
the amount thereof) under this title to which such agency would be entitled had such determination been made
on the basis of accurate data.
"APPLICATIONS
"SEC. 202. (a) No State educational agency shall be entitled to any payment under this title for any period
unless that agency submits an application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, and containing or
accompanied by such information, as the Secretary may reasonably require. Each such application shall—
"(1) provide that the payments under this title will be used for the purposes set forth in section 201(a);
"(2) provide assurances that such payments will be distributed among local educational agencies
within that State in accordance with the formula established by the Secretary under section 201, subject to
any reductions in payments for those local educational agencies identified under paragraph (3) to which
funds described by section 201(b)(2) are made available for the same purposes under other Federal laws;
"(3) specify the amount of funds described by section 201(b)(2) which are made available under other
Federal laws for expenditure within the State for the same purposes as those for which funds are made
available under this title and the local educational agencies to which such funds are made available;
"(4) provide assurances that the State educational agency will not finally disapprove in whole or in part
any application for funds received under this title without first affording the local educational agency
submitting the application for such funds reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing; and
[Release Point 118-106]
"(5) provide for making such reports as the Secretary may reasonably require to carry out this title.
"(b) The Secretary shall approve an application which meets the requirements of subsection (a). The
Secretary shall not finally disapprove an application of a State educational agency except after reasonable
notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record to such agency.
"PAYMENTS AND AUTHORIZATIONS
"SEC. 203. (a) The Secretary shall pay to each State educational agency having an application approved
under section 202 the amount which that State is entitled to receive under this title.
"(b) For fiscal year 1981 and for each subsequent fiscal year, there is authorized to be appropriated, in the
manner specified under section 102, to make payments under this title an amount equal to the product of—
"(1) the total number of eligible participants enrolled in elementary or secondary public schools under
the jurisdiction of local educational agencies within all the States (other than the jurisdictions to which
section 103 is applicable) during the fiscal year for which the determination is made,
multiplied by—
"(2) $400.
"TITLE III—SPECIAL IMPACT ASSISTANCE FOR SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN
ATTENDANCE
"STATE ENTITLEMENTS

section 302.
"(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection and in subsections (c) and (d) of this section,
the amount of the grant to which a State educational agency is entitled under this title for any fiscal year shall
be equal to the sum of—
"(A) the amount equal to the product of (i) the number of eligible participants enrolled during the
period for which the determination is made in elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction
of each local educational agency described under paragraph (2) within that State, or in any elementary or
secondary nonpublic school within the district served by each such local educational agency, who have
been eligible participants less than one year, multiplied by (ii) $700;
"(B) the amount equal to the product of (i) the number of eligible participants enrolled during the
period for which the determination is made in elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction
of each local educational agency described under paragraph (2) within that State, or in any elementary or
secondary nonpublic school within the district served by each such local educational agency, who have
been eligible participants at least one year but not more than two years, multiplied by (ii) $500; and
"(C) the product of (i) the number of eligible participants enrolled during the period for which the
determination is made in elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of each local
educational agency described under paragraph (2) within that State, or in any elementary or secondary
nonpublic school within the district served by each such local educational agency, who have been eligible
participants more than two years but not more than three years, multiplied by (ii) $300.
"(2) The local educational agencies referred to in paragraph (1) are those local educational agencies in
which the sum of the number of eligible participants who are enrolled in elementary or secondary public
schools under the jurisdiction of such agencies, or in elementary or secondary nonpublic schools within the
districts served by such agencies, during the fiscal year for which the payments are to be made under this title,
and are receiving supplementary educational services during such period, is equal to—
"(A) at least 500; or
"(B) at least 5 percent of the total number of students enrolled in such public or nonpublic schools
during such fiscal year;
whichever number is less. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the local educational agencies
referred to in paragraph (1) shall include local educational agencies eligible to receive assistance by reason of
the last sentence of section 3(b) and section 3(c)(2)(B) of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874,
Eighty-first Congress) [formerly 20 U.S.C. 238(b) and (c)(2)(B)], relating to Federal impact aid, subject to
paragraph (5) of this subsection.
"(3) The amount of the grant to which a State educational agency is otherwise entitled for any fiscal year, as
determined under paragraph (1), shall be reduced by the amounts made available under any other Federal law
to agencies or other entities for educational, or education-related, services or activities within the State
because of the significant concentration of eligible participants. The amount of the reduction required under
this paragraph shall be determined by the Secretary in a manner consistent with subsection (c).
[Release Point 118-106]
"(4) For the purpose of this subsection, the term 'State' does not include Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin
Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The entitlements of such
jurisdictions shall be determined in the manner specified in section 103, but for purposes of this title and
section 105 any payments made under section 103 for the purposes set forth in section 302 shall be considered
to be payments under this title.
"(5) The amount of the grant to which a State educational agency is entitled as a result of the last sentence
of paragraph (2) shall be limited to eligible participants who meet the requirements of section 101(4).
"(c) Determinations by the Secretary under this title for any period with respect to the number of eligible
participants and the amount of the reduction under subsection (b)(3) shall be made, whenever actual
satisfactory data are not available, on the basis of estimates. No such determination shall operate because of an
underestimate or overestimate to deprive any State educational agency of its entitlement to any payment (or
the amount thereof) under this title to which such agency would be entitled had such determination been made
on the basis of accurate data.
"(d) Whenever the Secretary determines that any amount of a payment made to a State under this title for a
fiscal year will not be used by such State for carrying out the purpose for which the payment was made, the
Secretary shall make such amount available for carrying out such purpose to one or more other States to the
extent the Secretary determines that such other States will be able to use such additional amount for carrying
out such purpose. Any amount made available to a State from an appropriation for a fiscal year in accordance
with the preceding sentence shall, for purposes of this title, be regarded as part of such State's payment (as
determined under subsection (b)) for such year, but shall remain available until the end of the succeeding
fiscal year.
"USES OF FUNDS

§1533. Removal court procedure
(a) Application
(1) In general
In any case in which the Attorney General has classified information that an alien is an alien

application with the removal court that contains—
(A) the identity of the attorney in the Department of Justice making the application;
(B) a certification by the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General that the
application satisfies the criteria and requirements of this section;
(C) the identity of the alien for whom authorization for the removal proceeding is sought; and
(D) a statement of the facts and circumstances relied on by the Department of Justice to
establish probable cause that—
(i) the alien is an alien terrorist;
(ii) the alien is physically present in the United States; and
(iii) with respect to such alien, removal under subchapter II would pose a risk to the
national security of the United States.
(2) Filing
An application under this section shall be submitted ex parte and in camera, and shall be filed
under seal with the removal court.
(b) Right to dismiss
The Attorney General may dismiss a removal action under this subchapter at any stage of the
proceeding.

In determining whether to grant an application under this section, a single judge of the removal
court may consider, ex parte and in camera, in addition to the information contained in the
application—
(A) other information, including classified information, presented under oath or affirmation;
and
(B) testimony received in any hearing on the application, of which a verbatim record shall be
kept.
(2) Approval of order
The judge shall issue an order granting the application, if the judge finds that there is probable
[Release Point 118-106]
cause to believe that—
(A) the alien who is the subject of the application has been correctly identified and is an alien
terrorist present in the United States; and
(B) removal under subchapter II would pose a risk to the national security of the United
States.
(3) Denial of order
If the judge denies the order requested in the application, the judge shall prepare a written
statement of the reasons for the denial, taking all necessary precautions not to disclose any
classified information contained in the Government's application.
(d) Exclusive provisions
If an order is issued under this section granting an application, the rights of the alien regarding
removal and expulsion shall be governed solely by this subchapter, and except as they are
specifically referenced in this subchapter, no other provisions of this chapter shall be applicable.

such a hearing shall be kept.
(5) Removal decision based on evidence at hearing
The decision of the judge regarding removal shall be based only on that evidence introduced at
the removal hearing.
(d) Subpoenas
(1) Request
At any time prior to the conclusion of the removal hearing, either the alien or the Department of
Justice may request the judge to issue a subpoena for the presence of a named witness (which
subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed to produce books, papers,
documents, or other objects designated therein) upon a satisfactory showing that the presence of
the witness is necessary for the determination of any material matter. Such a request may be made
ex parte except that the judge shall inform the Department of Justice of any request for a subpoena
by the alien for a witness or material if compliance with such a subpoena would reveal classified
evidence or the source of that evidence. The Department of Justice shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to oppose the issuance of such a subpoena.
(2) Payment for attendance
If an application for a subpoena by the alien also makes a showing that the alien is financially
unable to pay for the attendance of a witness so requested, the court may order the costs incurred
by the process and the fees of the witness so subpoenaed to be paid from funds appropriated for
the enforcement of subchapter II.
(3) Nationwide service
A subpoena under this subsection may be served anywhere in the United States.
(4) Witness fees
A witness subpoenaed under this subsection shall receive the same fees and expenses as a
witness subpoenaed in connection with a civil proceeding in a court of the United States.
(5) No access to classified information
Nothing in this subsection is intended to allow an alien to have access to classified information.
(e) Discovery
(1) In general
For purposes of this subchapter—
(A) the Government is authorized to use in a removal proceedings 1 the fruits of electronic
[Release Point 118-106]
surveillance and unconsented physical searches authorized under the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) without regard to subsections (c), (e), (f), (g),
and (h) of section 106 of that Act [50 U.S.C. 1806(c), (e), (f), (g), (h)] and discovery of
information derived pursuant to such Act, or otherwise collected for national security purposes,
shall not be authorized if disclosure would present a risk to the national security of the United
States;
(B) an alien subject to removal under this subchapter shall not be entitled to suppress
evidence that the alien alleges was unlawfully obtained; and
(C) section 3504 of title 18 and section 1806(c) of title 50 shall not apply if the Attorney
General determines that public disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of the
United States because it would disclose classified information or otherwise threaten the
integrity of a pending investigation.
(2) Protective orders
Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the United States from seeking protective orders and
from asserting privileges ordinarily available to the United States to protect against the disclosure
of classified information, including the invocation of the military and State secrets privileges.
(3) Treatment of classified information
(A) Use
The judge shall examine, ex parte and in camera, any evidence for which the Attorney
General determines that public disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of the
United States or to the security of any individual because it would disclose classified
information and neither the alien nor the public shall be informed of such evidence or its
sources other than through reference to the summary provided pursuant to this paragraph.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Department of Justice may, in its discretion and, in
the case of classified information, after coordination with the originating agency, elect to
introduce such evidence in open session.
(B) Submission
With respect to such information, the Government shall submit to the removal court an
unclassified summary of the specific evidence that does not pose that risk.
(C) Approval
Not later than 15 days after submission, the judge shall approve the summary if the judge
finds that it is sufficient to enable the alien to prepare a defense. The Government shall deliver
to the alien a copy of the unclassified summary approved under this subparagraph.
(D) Disapproval
(i) In general
If an unclassified summary is not approved by the removal court under subparagraph (C),
the Government shall be afforded 15 days to correct the deficiencies identified by the court
and submit a revised unclassified summary.
(ii) Revised summary
If the revised unclassified summary is not approved by the court within 15 days of its
submission pursuant to subparagraph (C), the removal hearing shall be terminated unless the
judge makes the findings under clause (iii).
(iii) Findings
The findings described in this clause are, with respect to an alien, that—
(I) the continued presence of the alien in the United States would likely cause serious
and irreparable harm to the national security or death or serious bodily injury to any
person, and
(II) the provision of the summary would likely cause serious and irreparable harm to the
[Release Point 118-106]
national security or death or serious bodily injury to any person.
(E) Continuation of hearing without summary
If a judge makes the findings described in subparagraph (D)(iii)—
(i) if the alien involved is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, the
procedures described in subparagraph (F) shall apply; and
(ii) in all cases the special removal hearing shall continue, the Department of Justice shall
cause to be delivered to the alien a statement that no summary is possible, and the classified
information submitted in camera and ex parte may be used pursuant to this paragraph.
(F) Special procedures for access and challenges to classified information by special
attorneys in case of lawful permanent aliens
(i) In general
The procedures described in this subparagraph are that the judge (under rules of the
removal court) shall designate a special attorney to assist the alien—
(I) by reviewing in camera the classified information on behalf of the alien, and
(II) by challenging through an in camera proceeding the veracity of the evidence
contained in the classified information.
(ii) Restrictions on disclosure
A special attorney receiving classified information under clause (i)—
(I) shall not disclose the information to the alien or to any other attorney representing the
alien, and
(II) who discloses such information in violation of subclause (I) shall be subject to a fine
under title 18, imprisoned for not less than 10 years nor more than 25 years, or both.
(f) Arguments
Following the receipt of evidence, the Government and the alien shall be given fair opportunity to
present argument as to whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the removal of the alien. The
Government shall open the argument. The alien shall be permitted to reply. The Government shall
then be permitted to reply in rebuttal. The judge may allow any part of the argument that refers to
evidence received in camera and ex parte to be heard in camera and ex parte.
(g) Burden of proof
In the hearing, it is the Government's burden to prove, by the preponderance of the evidence, that
the alien is subject to removal because the alien is an alien terrorist.
(h) Rules of evidence
The Federal Rules of Evidence shall not apply in a removal hearing.
(i) Determination of deportation
If the judge, after considering the evidence on the record as a whole, finds that the Government
has met its burden, the judge shall order the alien removed and detained pending removal from the
United States. If the alien was released pending the removal hearing, the judge shall order the
Attorney General to take the alien into custody.
(j) Written order
At the time of issuing a decision as to whether the alien shall be removed, the judge shall prepare a
written order containing a statement of facts found and conclusions of law. Any portion of the order
that would reveal the substance or source of information received in camera and ex parte pursuant to
subsection (e) shall not be made available to the alien or the public.
(k) No right to ancillary relief
At no time shall the judge consider or provide for relief from removal based on—
(1) asylum under section 1158 of this title;
(2) by 2 withholding of removal under section 1231(b)(3) of this title;
[Release Point 118-106]
(3) cancellation of removal under section 1229b of this title;
(4) voluntary departure under section 1254a(e) 3 of this title;
(5) adjustment of status under section 1255 of this title; or
(6) registry under section 1259 of this title.
(l) Report on terrorist removal proceedings
Not later than 3 months from December 28, 2001, the Attorney General shall submit to Congress a
report concerning the effect and efficacy of alien terrorist removal proceedings, including the reasons
why proceedings pursuant to this section have not been used by the Attorney General in the past and
the effect on the use of these proceedings after the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001
(Public Law 107–56).

references, see note set out under section 1551 of this title.

(a) Release
(1) In general
Subject to paragraph (2), if the judge decides that an alien should not be removed, the alien shall
be released from custody.
(2) Custody pending appeal
If the Attorney General takes an appeal from such decision, the alien shall remain in custody,
subject to the provisions of section 3142 of title 18.
(b) Custody and removal
(1) Custody

removal order, the Attorney General shall retain the alien in custody and remove the alien to a
country specified under paragraph (2).
(2) Removal
(A) In general
The removal of an alien shall be to any country which the alien shall designate if such
designation does not, in the judgment of the Attorney General, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, impair the obligation of the United States under any treaty (including a treaty
pertaining to extradition) or otherwise adversely affect the foreign policy of the United States.
(B) Alternate countries
If the alien refuses to designate a country to which the alien wishes to be removed or if the
Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determines that removal of the
alien to the country so designated would impair a treaty obligation or adversely affect United
States foreign policy, the Attorney General shall cause the alien to be removed to any country
willing to receive such alien.
(C) Continued detention
If no country is willing to receive such an alien, the Attorney General may, notwithstanding
any other provision of law, retain the alien in custody. The Attorney General, in coordination
with the Secretary of State, shall make periodic efforts to reach agreement with other countries
to accept such an alien and at least every 6 months shall provide to the attorney representing the
alien at the removal hearing a written report on the Attorney General's efforts. Any alien in
custody pursuant to this subparagraph shall be released from custody solely at the discretion of
the Attorney General and subject to such conditions as the Attorney General shall deem
appropriate.
(D) Fingerprinting
Before an alien is removed from the United States pursuant to this subsection, or pursuant to

§1601. Statements of national policy concerning welfare and immigration
The Congress makes the following statements concerning national policy with respect to welfare
and immigration:
(1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States immigration law since this
country's earliest immigration statutes.
(2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the United States that—
(A) aliens within the Nation's borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but
rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, their sponsors, and
private organizations, and
(B) the availability of public benefits not constitute an incentive for immigration to the
United States.
(3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have been applying for and receiving public
benefits from Federal, State, and local governments at increasing rates.
(4) Current eligibility rules for public assistance and unenforceable financial support
agreements have proved wholly incapable of assuring that individual aliens not burden the public
benefits system.
(5) It is a compelling government interest to enact new rules for eligibility and sponsorship
agreements in order to assure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration
policy.
(6) It is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration
provided by the availability of public benefits.
(7) With respect to the State authority to make determinations concerning the eligibility of
qualified aliens for public benefits in this chapter, a State that chooses to follow the Federal
classification in determining the eligibility of such aliens for public assistance shall be considered
to have chosen the least restrictive means available for achieving the compelling governmental
interest of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.

order of a judge or administrative law judge or a prior determination of the Immigration and

STATUTORY NOTES AND RELATED SUBSIDIARIES
FINDINGS
Pub. L. 108–458, title VII, §7201(a), Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3808, provided that: "Consistent with the
report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the
following findings:
"(1) Travel documents are as important to terrorists as weapons since terrorists must travel
clandestinely to meet, train, plan, case targets, and gain access to attack sites.
"(2) International travel is dangerous for terrorists because they must surface to pass through regulated
channels, present themselves to border security officials, or attempt to circumvent inspection points.
"(3) Terrorists use evasive, but detectable, methods to travel, such as altered and counterfeit passports
and visas, specific travel methods and routes, liaisons with corrupt government officials, human smuggling
networks, supportive travel agencies, and immigration and identity fraud.
"(4) Before September 11, 2001, no Federal agency systematically analyzed terrorist travel strategies.
If an agency had done so, the agency could have discovered the ways in which the terrorist predecessors to
al Qaeda had been systematically, but detectably, exploiting weaknesses in our border security since the
early 1990s.
"(5) Many of the hijackers were potentially vulnerable to interception by border authorities. Analyzing
their characteristic travel documents and travel patterns could have allowed authorities to intercept some of
the hijackers and a more effective use of information available in government databases could have
identified some of the hijackers.
"(6) The routine operations of our immigration laws and the aspects of those laws not specifically
aimed at protecting against terrorism inevitably shaped al Qaeda's planning and opportunities.
"(7) New insights into terrorist travel gained since September 11, 2001, have not been adequately
integrated into the front lines of border security.
"(8) The small classified terrorist travel intelligence collection and analysis program currently in place
has produced useful results and should be expanded."
§1777. Establishment of Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center
(a) Establishment
There is established a Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (referred to in this section as the
"Center").
(b) Operation

Government agencies in support of the United States strategy to prevent separate, but related,
[Release Point 118-106]
issues of clandestine terrorist travel and facilitation of migrant smuggling and trafficking of
persons;
(3) ensure cooperation among all relevant policy, law enforcement, diplomatic, and intelligence
agencies of the Federal Government to improve effectiveness and to convert all information
available to the Federal Government relating to clandestine terrorist travel and facilitation, migrant
smuggling, and trafficking of persons into tactical, operational, and strategic intelligence that can
be used to combat such illegal activities; and
(4) prepare and submit to Congress, on an annual basis, a strategic assessment regarding
vulnerabilities in the United States and foreign travel system that may be exploited by
international terrorists, human smugglers and traffickers, and their facilitators.
