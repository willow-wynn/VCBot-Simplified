Toensurethat the futureof America isgreenandfree fromfurther harmtothe planet.
Be it enactedby theSenateandthe House ofRepresentativesof theUnited StatesofAmericain
Congress Assembled,
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE
This Actmaybe citedasthe“Clean EnergyFuture Actof 2022”orS.3.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress findsthat—
1(a) Withglobal warmingapproaching 1.5degrees,there shallbemajorenvironmentalcatastrophes if
wedonot act.
(b) Theclimate emergencyis alreadyshowing itseffects,posing arangeof threatsto society.
(c) Therefore,weshouldtry toslowthis down byenactingarangeof legislationtoavoidclimate
disasters.

2(a) Thecurrentnational gridis notsuitableto transport massamountsofenergy.
(b) TheU.S. must triple its transmissioninfrastructure todecarboniseby2050.
(c) Tofixthis, investment inhighvoltagetransmission linesisnecessary.
(d) This shallallowwind, solar, nuclearandhydro tobetransported whereit isneeded.
3(a) Nuclearenergyhasproved tobeareliableenergy source,as wellas safer thanfossil fuels.
(b) It isalsocost-effective, aswell ashelping tomake thecountrymoreenergy secure.
(c) Therefore,thegovernmentshould investinnuclear powerplant constructionprojects toreplace
fossilfuels.
4a) Heatpumpsareproving tobeaviablewayof heatingandcooling homes, whilealso beingthree
times asefficientasgasboilers.
(b) Theyarealso moreenvironmentallyfriendly than gasboilers becausetheyuse electricity.
(c) However,thecostfor these heatpumps ishigh, withlessthan10% ofhouseholdshaving one
installed.
(d) Tocombatthis, grantsshould beimplementedtoallow morehouseholdstomake agreenenergy
change.
5(a) Fossilfuels accounted for 92%of carbondioxideemissions in2019.
(b) Carbon dioxideisa greenhousegas, whichcontributestoglobal warming.
(c) Aslaidout in1(a)-(c), theconsequences ofglobal warmingshallbecatastrophic.
(d) Therefore, weshouldwork towardsalarge-scale reductionin fossilfuels.
