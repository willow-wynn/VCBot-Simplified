    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in political and news channels, indicating concerns about midterm elections and international tensions (Iran). This suggests a risk-off sentiment. Limited discussion in the 'States' channel implies less focus on domestic policy changes. The high volume in 'Public Square' suggests general anxiety and debate.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic data paints a concerning picture: high inflation, negative GDP growth, and unemployment slightly above the natural rate. This stagflationary environment warrants a cautious outlook. Market confidence is low, reflecting the economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord sentiment, the market outlook is bearish. Expect increased volatility and a downward trend. Sectors sensitive to economic downturns (e.g., entertainment, finance) will likely underperform, while defensive sectors (e.g., healthcare, energy) may offer some resilience.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction: Negative due to GDP decline. volatility: High due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. market_sentiment: Aligned with low market confidence. momentum: Reduced due to slowing economic growth. long_term_outlook: Slightly decreased to reflect increased uncertainty."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and geopolitical tensions support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending likely to decrease in a recessionary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face increased risk from potential loan defaults and a slowing economy.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Defensive sector, less sensitive to economic cycles. Demand for healthcare remains relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Mixed outlook; some industries may benefit from infrastructure spending, while others suffer from reduced demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral. Discount retailers may outperform as consumers seek value. Overall, consumer spending is expected to decline.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. High growth tech stocks are sensitive to interest rate hikes and economic slowdowns.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Reduced economic activity will decrease demand for transportation services."
