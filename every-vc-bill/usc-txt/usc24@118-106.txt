SUBCHAPTER III—MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE FOR DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA
§225. Findings and purposes
(a) The Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Governmentally administered mental health services in the District of Columbia are
currently provided through two separate public entities, the federally administered Saint Elizabeths
Hospital and the Mental Health Services Administration of the District of Columbia Department
of Human Resources.
(2) The District of Columbia has a continuing responsibility to provide mental health services to
its residents.
(3) The Federal Government, through its operation of a national mental health program at Saint
Elizabeths Hospital, has for over 100 years assisted the District of Columbia in carrying out that
responsibility.
(4) Since its establishment by Congress in 1855, Saint Elizabeths Hospital has developed into a
respected national mental health hospital and study, training, and treatment center, providing a
range of quality mental health and related services, including—
(i) acute and chronic inpatient psychiatric care;
(ii) outpatient psychiatric and substance abuse clinical and related services;
(iii) Federal court system forensic psychiatry referral, evaluation, and patient treatment
services for prisoners, and for individuals awaiting trial or requiring post-trial or post-sentence
psychiatric evaluation;
(iv) patient care and related services for designated classes of individuals entitled to mental
health benefits under Federal law, such as certain members and employees of the United States
Armed Forces and the Foreign Service, and residents of American overseas dependencies;
[Release Point 118-106]
(v) District of Columbia court system forensic psychiatry referral, evaluation, and patient
treatment services for prisoners, and for individuals awaiting trial or requiring post-trial or
postsentence psychiatric evaluation;
(vi) programs for special populations such as the mentally ill deaf;
(vii) support for basic and applied clinical psychiatric research and related patient services
conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health and other institutions; and
(viii) professional and paraprofessional training in the major mental health disciplines.
(5) The continuation of the range of services currently provided by federally administered Saint
Elizabeths Hospital must be assured, as these services are integrally related to—
(i) the availability of adequate mental health services to District of Columbia residents,
nonresidents who require mental health services while in the District of Columbia, individuals
entitled to mental health services under Federal law, and individuals referred by both Federal
and local court systems; and
(ii) the Nation's capacity to increase our knowledge and understanding about mental illness
and to facilitate and continue the development and broad availability of sound and modern
methods and approaches for the treatment of mental illness.
(6) The assumption of all or selected functions, programs, and resources of Saint Elizabeths
Hospital from the Federal Government by the District of Columbia, and the integration of those
functions, resources, and programs into a comprehensive mental health care system administered
solely by the District of Columbia, will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the services
currently provided through those two separate entities by shifting the primary focus of care to an
integrated community-based system.
(7) Such assumption of all or selected functions, programs, and resources of Saint Elizabeths
Hospital by the District of Columbia would further the principle of home rule for the District of
Columbia.
(b) It is the intent of Congress that—
(1) the District of Columbia have in operation no later than October 1, 1993, an integrated
coordinated mental health system in the District which provides—
(A) high quality, cost-effective, and community-based programs and facilities;
(B) a continuum of inpatient and outpatient mental health care, residential treatment, and
support services through an appropriate balance of public and private resources; and
(C) assurances that patient rights and medical needs are protected;
(2) the comprehensive District mental health care system be in full compliance with the Federal
court consent decree in Dixon v. Heckler;
(3) the District and Federal Governments bear equitable shares of the costs of a transition from
the present system to a comprehensive District mental health system;
(4) the transition to a comprehensive District mental health system provided for by this
subchapter be carried out with maximum consideration for the interests of employees of the
Hospital and provide a right-of-first-refusal to such employees for employment at comparable
levels in positions created under the system implementation plan;
(5) the Federal Government have the responsibility for the retraining of Hospital employees to
prepare such employees for the requirements of employment in a comprehensive District mental
health system;
(6) the Federal Government continue high quality mental health research, training, and
demonstration programs at Saint Elizabeths Hospital;
(7) the District government establish and maintain accreditation and licensing standards for all
services provided in District mental health facilities which assure quality care consistent with
appropriate Federal regulations and comparable with standards of the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Hospitals; and
[Release Point 118-106]
(8) the comprehensive mental health system plan include a component for direct services for the
homeless mentally ill.

Buy American Act with respect to such types of products produced in that foreign country.
(2) An agreement referred to in paragraph (1) is any agreement,1 between the United States and a

event shall the patient be detained more than forty-eight hours (excluding any period of time falling
on a Sunday or legal holiday) after the receipt of such request unless within such time (1) judicial
proceedings for such hospitalization are commenced or (2) a judicial extension of such time is
obtained, for a period of not more than five days, for the commencement of such proceedings.
(b) Transfer to another hospital
The Secretary is authorized at any time, when he deems it to be in the interest of the person or of
the institution affected, to transfer any person hospitalized under section 324 of this title from one
hospital to another, and to that end any judicial commitment of any person so hospitalized may be to
the Secretary.

§327. Notification to committing court of discharge or conditional release
In the case of any person hospitalized under section 324 of this title who has been judicially
committed to the Secretary's custody, the Secretary shall, upon the discharge or conditional release
[Release Point 118-106]
of such person, or upon such person's transfer and release under section 323 of this title, notify the

(a) Persons liable; scope of liability; compromise or waiver; investigations; judicial proceedings
Any person hospitalized under section 324 of this title or his estate, shall be liable to pay or
contribute toward the payment of the costs or charges for his care and treatment to the same extent as
such person would, if resident in the District of Columbia, be liable to pay, under the laws of the
District of Columbia, for his care and maintenance in a hospital for the mentally ill in that
jurisdiction. The Secretary may, in his discretion, where in his judgment substantial justice will be
best served thereby or the probable recovery will not warrant the expense of collection, compromise
or waive the whole or any portion of any claim under this section. In carrying out this section, the
Secretary may make or cause to be made such investigations as may be necessary to determine the
ability of any person hospitalized under section 324 of this title to pay or contribute toward the cost
of his hospitalization. All collections or reimbursement on account of the costs and charges for the
care of the eligible person shall be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. Any judicial
proceedings to recover such costs or charges shall be brought in the name of the United States in any
court of competent jurisdiction.
(b) "Costs or charges" defined
As used in this section, the term "costs or charges" means, in the case of hospitalization at a
hospital under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services, a per diem rate
prescribed by the Secretary on a basis comparable to that charged for any other paying patients and,
in the case of persons hospitalized elsewhere, the contract rate or a per diem rate fixed by the
Secretary on the basis of the contract rate.

§420. Disposition of effects of deceased persons; unclaimed property
(a) Disposition of effects of deceased persons
The Administrator of a facility of the Retirement Home shall safeguard and dispose of the estate
and personal effects of deceased residents, including effects delivered to such facility under sections
7712(f) and 9712(f) of title 10, and shall ensure the following:
(1) A will or other instrument of a testamentary nature involving property rights executed by a
resident shall be promptly delivered, upon the death of the resident, to the proper court of record.
(2) If a resident dies intestate and the heirs or legal representative of the deceased cannot be
immediately ascertained, the Administrator shall retain all property left by the decedent for a
three-year period beginning on the date of the death. If entitlement to such property is established
to the satisfaction of the Administrator at any time during the three-year period, the Administrator
shall distribute the decedent's property, in equal pro-rata shares when multiple beneficiaries have
been identified, to the highest following categories of identified survivors (listed in the order of
precedence indicated):
(A) The surviving spouse or legal representative.
(B) The children of the deceased.
(C) The parents of the deceased.
(D) The siblings of the deceased.
(E) The next-of-kin of the deceased.
(b) Sale of effects
(1)(A) If the disposition of the estate of a resident of the Retirement Home cannot be
accomplished under subsection (a)(2) or if a resident dies testate and the nominated fiduciary,
legatees, or heirs of the resident cannot be immediately ascertained, the entirety of the deceased
resident's domiciliary estate and the entirety of any ancillary estate that is unclaimed at the end of the
three-year period beginning on the date of the death of the resident shall escheat to the Retirement
Home.
(B) Upon the sale of any such unclaimed estate property, the proceeds of the sale shall be
deposited in the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund.
(C) If a personal representative or other fiduciary is appointed to administer a deceased resident's
estate and the administration is completed before the end of such three-year period, the balance of
[Release Point 118-106]
the entire net proceeds of the estate, less expenses, shall be deposited directly in the Armed Forces
Retirement Home Trust Fund. The heirs or legatees of the deceased resident may file a claim made
with the Secretary of Defense to reclaim such proceeds. A determination of the claim by the
Secretary shall be subject to judicial review exclusively by the United States Court of Federal
Claims.
(2)(A) The Administrator of a facility of the Retirement Home may designate an attorney who is a
full-time officer or employee of the United States or a member of the Armed Forces on active duty to
serve as attorney or agent for the facility in any probate proceeding in which the Retirement Home
may have a legal interest as nominated fiduciary, testamentary legatee, escheat legatee, or in any
other capacity.
(B) An attorney designated under this paragraph may, in the domiciliary jurisdiction of the
deceased resident and in any ancillary jurisdiction, petition for appointment as fiduciary. The
attorney shall have priority over any petitioners (other than the deceased resident's nominated
fiduciary, named legatees, or heirs) to serve as fiduciary. In a probate proceeding in which the heirs
of an intestate deceased resident cannot be located and in a probate proceeding in which the
nominated fiduciary, legatees, or heirs of a testate deceased resident cannot be located, the attorney
shall be appointed as the fiduciary of the deceased resident's estate.
(3) The designation of an employee or representative of a facility of the Retirement Home as
personal representative of the estate of a resident of the Retirement Home or as a legatee under the
will or codicil of the resident shall not disqualify an employee or staff member of that facility from
serving as a competent witness to a will or codicil of the resident.
(4) After the end of the three-year period beginning on the date of the death of a resident of a
facility, the Administrator of the facility shall dispose of all property of the deceased resident that is
not otherwise disposed of under this subsection, including personal effects such as decorations,
medals, and citations to which a right has not been established under subsection (a). Disposal may be
made within the discretion of the Administrator by—
(A) retaining such property or effects for the facility;
(B) offering such items to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, a State, another military home, a
museum, or any other institution having an interest in such items; or
(C) destroying any items determined by the Administrator to be valueless.
(c) Transfer of proceeds to Fund
The net proceeds received by the Administrators from the sale of effects under subsection (b) shall
be deposited in the Fund.
(d) Subsequent claim
(1) A claim for the net proceeds of the sale under subsection (b) of the effects of a deceased may
be filed with the Secretary of Defense at any time within six years after the death of the deceased, for
action under section 2771 of title 10.
(2) A claim referred to in paragraph (1) may not be considered by a court or the Secretary unless
the claim is filed within the time period prescribed in such paragraph.
(3) A claim allowed by the Secretary under paragraph (1) shall be certified to the Secretary of the
Treasury for payment from the Fund in the amount found due, including any interest relating to the
amount. No claim may be allowed or paid in excess of the net proceeds of the estate deposited in the
Fund under subsection (c) plus interest.
(e) Unclaimed property
In the case of property delivered to the Retirement Home under section 2575 of title 10, the
Administrator of the facility shall deliver the property to the owner, the heirs or next of kin of the
owner, or the legal representative of the owner, if a right to the property is established to the
satisfaction of the Administrator of the facility within two years after the delivery.
