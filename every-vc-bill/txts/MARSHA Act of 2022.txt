A BILL
SECTION 101. SHORT TITLE AND TABLE OF CONTENTS.
This Act may be cited as the “ MARSHA Act”;
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
A BILL
SECTION 102. FINDINGS.
SECTION 103. DEFINITIONS

SECTION 102. FINDINGS.
1. This bill would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation, gender identity, marital status, or religion in the
provision of child welfare programs and services by entities
receiving federal funding. The Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) must provide technical assistance to help states
follow this requirement.
2. Many public child welfare agencies choose to discriminate
against qualified, licensed LGBTQ foster and adoptive families.
3. Thousands of children and youth lack a stable, safe, and loving
temporary or permanent home and have been placed in a
congregate care setting, which is associated with more
placements, poorer educational outcomes, and greater risk of
further trauma.
4. According to the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and
Reporting System FY 2018 data, more than 125,000 youth living
in the foster system in 2018 were eligible for adoption.
4.1. However, many taxpayer-funded child welfare agencies
still discriminate against qualified lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) foster and adoptive
families:
4.1.1. This forces them to go through a more extensive,
time-consuming, and costly process before allowing
placement.
4.2. By denying LGBTQ+ families the ability to foster, they’re
essentially denying children the right to a healthy,
environmentally friendly permanent home.
5. There are currently no such safeguards against discrimination
based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status,
but only against racial prejudice, and racial discrimination.
