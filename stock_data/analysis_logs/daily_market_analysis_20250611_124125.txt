The 'verified' tag suggests some level of authenticity, but the overall sentiment is neutral. The executive branch activity indicates potential policy shifts, but the limited congressional activity suggests gridlock.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a challenging environment. High inflation and negative GDP growth indicate stagflation. Low unemployment provides some support, but the deviation from the Fed's inflation target is concerning. Market confidence is low, reflecting the economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to stagflationary pressures. High volatility is expected. Sectors like Energy and Healthcare may outperform due to their defensive characteristics. Growth stocks are likely to underperform. The long-term outlook remains uncertain, dependent on the Fed's ability to control inflation without triggering a deep recession.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to the GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment aligns with low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to the low unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to inflation and potential supply constraints.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook due to discretionary spending cuts amid inflation.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral outlook. Banks face headwinds from a slowing economy but benefit from higher interest rates.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive outlook as healthcare is a defensive sector.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral to slightly negative outlook due to slowing economic growth.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative outlook as consumer spending is likely to decline due to inflation.",
    "TECH": "Negative outlook as growth stocks are under pressure from rising interest rates and slowing growth.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral outlook, dependent on overall economic activity."
