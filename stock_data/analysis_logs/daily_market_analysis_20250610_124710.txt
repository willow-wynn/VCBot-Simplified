While unemployment is low, it's close to the natural rate, limiting its positive impact. The market is likely to react negatively to these conditions.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to the unfavorable economic conditions. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely weigh on corporate earnings and investor sentiment. Expect increased volatility and a downward trend. Long-term outlook is slightly below neutral, reflecting concerns about sustained economic weakness.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to the low unemployment rate, but overall negative economic conditions limit its impact. Long-term outlook is slightly adjusted downward to reflect the current economic uncertainty."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector is expected to perform relatively well due to continued demand and supply constraints, despite the overall economic downturn. XOM, CVX, and COP are likely to be more resilient.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector faces challenges due to reduced consumer spending amid economic uncertainty. DIS and NFLX may experience slower growth.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector is vulnerable to the economic downturn and potential interest rate hikes. JPM, BAC, and GS are likely to face headwinds.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector is relatively stable due to its defensive nature. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are expected to maintain steady performance.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is negatively impacted by the economic slowdown and reduced capital spending. CAT and GE may experience lower demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector faces challenges due to reduced consumer spending and inflationary pressures. WMT and COST may see slower growth.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector is mixed, with some companies more resilient than others. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are likely to be affected by the economic downturn, but their strong fundamentals may provide some support.",
    "TRANSPORT": "The transport sector is expected to be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown. BA is likely to face headwinds."
