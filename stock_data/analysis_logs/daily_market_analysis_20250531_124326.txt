  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of political commentary and general discussion, with limited direct impact on specific stock valuations. The high volume in Public Square suggests general market awareness, but the lack of specific investment-related discussion limits its influence. The Congress channel indicates policy discussions, which could indirectly affect sectors depending on the topics discussed.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) necessitates a hawkish monetary policy, likely leading to further interest rate hikes. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) signals a potential recession. The unemployment rate (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), indicating some labor market weakness. Low market confidence (35%) reflects the overall economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to high inflation, negative GDP growth, and low market confidence. Expect continued volatility as the Fed attempts to combat inflation without triggering a deep recession. Sectors sensitive to interest rates and economic growth (e.g., Finance, Consumer Discretionary) are likely to underperform. Energy may see continued strength due to supply constraints.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend Direction: Set to -0.25 to reflect negative GDP growth and overall economic momentum. Volatility: Set to 0.95 to reflect the high inflation rate significantly deviating from the target. Market Sentiment: Aligned with the market confidence of 35%. Momentum: Set to 0.20, reflecting the slightly elevated unemployment rate and weak economic growth. Long-Term Outlook: Adjusted slightly downward to 0.35 to reflect the current economic headwinds."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items may decline due to inflation.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and potential recessionary pressures negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces regulatory pressures.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Slowing economic growth and potential trade disruptions weigh on manufacturing.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Inflation and slowing consumer spending create headwinds for retailers.",
    "TECH": "Neutral. Tech companies face mixed prospects, with some benefiting from remote work trends while others are vulnerable to economic slowdown.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation faces challenges from high fuel costs and potential supply chain disruptions."
