  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows low engagement in Congress and News channels, indicating a lack of confidence in policy and information flow. The Public Square activity is high but lacks focused discussion, suggesting general uncertainty. Executive channel activity is minimal, reflecting leadership absence or indecision. This overall points to a bearish sentiment.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed target (2.0%) coupled with negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates stagflation. The unemployment rate (3.2%) is below the natural rate, but this is likely unsustainable given the economic contraction. Market confidence is low (35%), reflecting the economic uncertainty. The economic assessment is bearish.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment and low market confidence, a bearish short-term outlook is warranted. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic growth and consumer spending are likely to underperform. Defensive sectors and energy may offer some relative protection. The market outlook is bearish.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (1.15) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence (0.35). Momentum is slightly positive (0.25) to account for the low unemployment rate, but is dampened by the negative GDP growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced (0.41) to reflect the increased economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decline in a recessionary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and economic slowdown will negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector, but faces inflationary pressures.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Economic slowdown and rising input costs will negatively impact manufacturing.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decline due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies face both growth concerns and valuation pressures.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Economic slowdown will reduce demand for transportation services."
