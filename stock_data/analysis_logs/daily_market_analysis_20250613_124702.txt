    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Low market confidence and a slightly better unemployment rate contribute to overall uncertainty. The Fed's inability to control inflation is a major concern.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Investors are likely to remain risk-averse until there are clear signs of economic improvement. Expect sector rotation towards defensive stocks.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment is low, reflecting poor market confidence. Momentum is slightly negative due to economic headwinds. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced due to the current economic climate."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints will likely support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Discretionary spending is likely to decrease in a recessionary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face increased risk from potential loan defaults and a slowing economy.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector and may outperform during economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing activity is likely to decline due to reduced demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is expected to decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies may face slower growth due to reduced corporate and consumer spending.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation may be affected by reduced economic activity, but some segments may benefit from infrastructure spending."
