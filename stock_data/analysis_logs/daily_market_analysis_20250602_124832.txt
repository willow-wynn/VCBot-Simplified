    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in the Public Square and Congress channels, indicating concerns about political and economic issues. The news channel highlights geopolitical tensions (Iran) and potential White House instability, contributing to market uncertainty. This negative sentiment is reflected in lower market confidence and risk appetite.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture: high inflation, negative GDP growth, and unemployment slightly above the natural rate. This stagflationary environment necessitates a cautious approach. The high inflation rate significantly impacts volatility, while negative GDP growth and unemployment influence the trend direction and momentum.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to the prevailing economic headwinds and negative sentiment. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Energy sector may outperform due to geopolitical concerns, while sectors sensitive to economic growth (e.g., manufacturing, transportation) are likely to underperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction is set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and economic momentum. volatility is set to 1.10 to account for the high inflation rate. market_sentiment is aligned with the market confidence level of 35%. momentum is adjusted to 0.20 to reflect the weak economic growth and employment trends. long_term_outlook is slightly reduced to 0.36 to reflect the increased uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive: Geopolitical tensions and supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative: Consumer spending on discretionary items may decline due to inflation.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative: Interest rate hikes and economic slowdown negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral: Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces cost pressures.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative: Economic slowdown and supply chain issues weigh on manufacturing activity.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative: Inflation and reduced consumer spending impact retail sales.",
    "TECH": "Neutral: Some tech companies are resilient, but overall sector faces headwinds from higher interest rates and slower growth.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative: Economic slowdown and high fuel costs negatively impact transportation companies."
