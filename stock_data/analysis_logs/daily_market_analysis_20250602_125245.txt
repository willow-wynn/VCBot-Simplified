    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in political and news channels, indicating heightened awareness of macroeconomic factors and geopolitical risks. The 'Congress' channel focuses on legislative actions, suggesting potential policy impacts on the market. The 'Executive' channel's activity might reflect concerns or anticipation regarding executive decisions. This overall heightened awareness contributes to market volatility and cautious sentiment.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target (2.0%), necessitating potentially aggressive monetary policy. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) signals a possible recession. Market confidence is low (35%), reflecting the economic uncertainty. Unemployment (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), adding to the negative outlook. These factors collectively point towards a bearish market trend.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth are major headwinds. Low market confidence and heightened awareness of risks on Discord suggest investors are likely to be risk-averse. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices, particularly in sectors sensitive to economic cycles. Energy sector might see some support due to geopolitical tensions.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction: Set to -0.25 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic momentum.\nvolatility: Set to 0.95 to reflect the high inflation rate and economic uncertainty.\nmarket_sentiment: Aligned with the market confidence of 35%.\nmomentum: Slightly reduced to 0.20 to reflect the slowing economic growth and slightly elevated unemployment.\nlong_term_outlook: Adjusted slightly to 0.36 to reflect the potential for long-term recovery, but still cautious."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Neutral to Positive: Geopolitical tensions and supply constraints could support energy prices, but demand may weaken due to recession fears.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative: Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment is likely to decline during an economic downturn.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative: Banks and financial institutions face increased risks from potential loan defaults and reduced investment activity.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral: Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector, but faces cost pressures from inflation.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative: Manufacturing activity is likely to decline due to reduced business investment and consumer demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative: Consumer spending is expected to decline, particularly on non-essential items, impacting retail sales.",
    "TECH": "Negative: Tech companies face reduced business investment and consumer spending, as well as increased regulatory scrutiny.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative: Reduced economic activity will lead to lower demand for transportation services."
