SEC 3. AMENDING AND REAUTHORIZATION OF THE “CODE ACT OF
2021”
A. IN GENERAL. — This section reauthorizes the CODE Act of 2021 with additional
funding to continue the program as well as corrects an error in the original act.
B. AMENDING.— H.R. 26 of the 137th Congress entitled “Computers for Opportunity
Development in Education Act of 2021” otherwise cited as the “CODE Act of 2021”
shall be amended by the following;
a. Replace the word “countries” in Section 4 Subsection (b) with the word
“companies.”
C. FUNDING. —A total sum of 2,000,000,000 is herein appropriated, out of any money
in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the October 2023 fiscal month, for
the purposes of the administration of the provisions of the “CODE Act of 2021”, to
remain available until expended.
D. EFFECTIVE DATE.— The provisions of this section shall come into effect one
month after passage.
SEC 4. CREATION OF THE CLASSROOM BROADBAND ACCESS GRANT
PROGRAM
A. IN GENERAL. — This section authorizes the creation of the Classroom Broadband
Access Grant Program and authorizes funds for the Department of Education to
allocate funding in accordance with the provisions of this section.
B. DEFINITIONS.—For the purposes of this section:
a. “Broadband” means the FCC standard of 1mbps a second per student.
C. ESTABLISHMENT OF GRANT PROGRAM.—The Department of Education shall
establish a grant program for the purpose of providing funding to public schools,
private schools, and charter schools (referred to in this section as "eligible entities")
for the modernization of classrooms with broadband internet access.
D. REASONING AND METHODS — For the purposes of the section, these reasonings
and methods have been used to calculate the total required funds for this proposal.
a. In 2022, over 67% of all schools had access to broadband internet compared to
when only 4.3 million students had access to speeds over 100kbps. This
means that of the 73 million students in the United States, over 24 million
students do not have access to broadband internet.
b. The average cost for a K-12 student to have access to broadband internet
access of over 1mbps in the United States is $2.26. This equates to over $54
million dollars.

3
c. By rounding up by an extra $46 million dollars to account for any cost
overruns and administrative costs, the amount of $100 million dollars would
be more than satisfactory to cover the costs for the 24 million students who do
not have ready access to broadband speeds.
E. USE OF FUNDS.—Funds provided under the grant program may be used for the
following purposes:
a. Purchasing state-of-the-art technology equipment and software for
classrooms.

of technology in the classroom.

technology to enhance the learning experience for students.
e. Grant funds may not be used for over 50% of the total of any individual
program creation without special authorization from the Department of
Education on a need-to-need basis.
F. APPLICATION.—Eligible entities seeking funding under the grant program shall
submit an application to the Department of Education in such form and manner as
the Department may prescribe. The application shall include a detailed plan for the
use of the funds, including (1) a budget, (2) a timeline for implementation, and (3) a
plan for the implementation of grant funds.
G. SELECTION CRITERIA.—The Department of Education shall establish selection
criteria for the award of grants under the grant program, which shall include the

C. REASONING AND METHODS —
a. In order to calculate the appropriations necessary to fund this section, a
thorough analysis of the requisite expenditures was conducted. It has been
determined that there are approximately 130,000 public, private, and charter
schools in the United States that would be eligible for the grant program. The
average cost to develop and implement career readiness programs and
initiatives per school was estimated to be $50,000 with the grant program
contributing no more than 50% of the total cost without special authorization
from the Department of Education on a need-to-need basis.. This includes
costs for professional development for teachers and staff, developing
partnerships with employers and community organizations, and providing
resources and support for students. Additionally, the administrative cost to
administer the grant program, which includes reviewing applications,
awarding grants, monitoring progress, and conducting evaluations, was
estimated to be 5% of the total cost. Therefore, the total estimated cost to
fund the grant program and administer it would be approximately $4 billion.
