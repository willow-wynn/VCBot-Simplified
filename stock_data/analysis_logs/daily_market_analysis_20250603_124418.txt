  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of concern and attempts at reassurance. The 'no money??? Sad' comment reflects the economic anxiety. The high volume in Congress suggests legislative activity, but the lack of specific positive sentiment tempers any bullish interpretation. Executive branch activity is moderate, indicating some policy adjustments. News volume is also moderate, suggesting no major market-moving events.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) is a major headwind. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) confirms a contraction. Unemployment (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low at 35%, reflecting the overall negative sentiment.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely weigh on corporate earnings and investor sentiment. Increased volatility is expected. Sectors sensitive to consumer spending (e.g., Entertainment, Retail) will likely underperform. Energy may see some relative strength due to inflationary pressures. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, assuming eventual policy adjustments.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (1.15) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence (0.35). Momentum is slightly positive (0.20) to account for some underlying economic activity and employment trends. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.35 to reflect the current economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector may see some relative strength due to inflationary pressures and potential supply constraints. Expect continued volatility but overall positive performance.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector will likely underperform due to reduced consumer spending in a contracting economy. High sensitivity to economic downturns.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector faces headwinds from potential interest rate hikes and a slowing economy. Increased volatility and potential for loan losses.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector is relatively defensive but faces pressures from potential healthcare reforms and cost containment measures. Expect stable but moderate performance.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is sensitive to economic cycles and will likely face reduced demand due to the economic contraction. Expect underperformance.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector will likely underperform due to reduced consumer spending and inflationary pressures. Expect increased competition and margin compression.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector faces mixed prospects. Some segments may be resilient, but overall growth will likely be tempered by the economic slowdown. Expect increased volatility.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector is highly sensitive to economic activity and will likely face reduced demand due to the economic contraction. Expect underperformance."
