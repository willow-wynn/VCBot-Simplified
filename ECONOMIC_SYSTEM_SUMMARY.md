## üõ† Integration Instructions

### Step 1: Add Import to bot.py
```python
import economic_utils
```

### Step 2: Add Commands to bot.py
Copy all command functions from `bot_economic_integration.py` into `bot.py` after existing commands.

### Step 3: Initialize Economic Engine
In the `on_ready()` function, add:
```python
# Start economic analysis system
economic_utils.start_economic_engine(client)
```

### Step 4: Deploy and Test
1. Run the bot with the new commands
2. Use `/fetch_econ_data` to initialize the economic system
3. Use `/econ_report` to view generated analysis
4. Use `/econ_status` to monitor system health

## üìà Economic Model Details

### GDP Calculation
```
GDP = (Legislative Activity √ó 0.4 + Committee Work √ó 0.3 + Public Engagement √ó 0.3) √ó Multiplier
```

### Stock Price Movement
```
New Price = Current Price √ó (1 + Government Efficiency + Sentiment Impact + Volatility)
```

### Market Sentiment
- Analyzed from message content using keyword detection
- Influences stock prices and economic confidence
- Tracks bipartisan cooperation and public approval

### Data Sources
- **Legislative Channels**: Bills, votes, amendments, resolutions
