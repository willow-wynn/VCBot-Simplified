Low executive activity and some state-level resignation indicate uncertainty. Public square activity suggests some anticipation of future events, but also some skepticism. News activity is low, suggesting a lack of market-moving information.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a mixed picture. High inflation and negative GDP growth signal stagflation. Low unemployment is a positive, but market confidence is very low. This environment suggests a bearish short-term outlook with potential for volatility.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment and low market confidence, a cautious approach is warranted. Expect downward pressure on most sectors, with energy and defense potentially outperforming due to inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. Monitor policy changes from Congress closely.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment aligns with low market confidence. Momentum is reduced due to economic slowdown. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect current economic headwinds."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Outperform: High inflation and geopolitical tensions support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Underperform: Discretionary spending is likely to decrease in a recessionary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Underperform: High interest rates and economic uncertainty will negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral: Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces policy risks.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Underperform: Sensitive to economic cycles, manufacturing will likely suffer from reduced demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Underperform: Discretionary retail will be hit hard, while staples may hold up better.",
    "TECH": "Underperform: High growth tech stocks are sensitive to interest rate hikes and economic slowdown.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral: Mixed outlook, some segments may benefit from infrastructure spending, while others suffer from reduced demand."
