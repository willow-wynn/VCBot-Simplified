    "market_outlook": "Given the economic data and sentiment, the market outlook is bearish. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on prices. Sectors sensitive to economic growth (e.g., Finance, Manufacturing) are likely to underperform. Energy may see some support due to inflation.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction is negative to reflect negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the large deviation of inflation from the target. Market_sentiment is low, matching the confidence level. Momentum is slightly positive due to the low unemployment. Long_term_outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic uncertainty."

    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Slowing economic growth hurts manufacturing activity.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Inflation reduces consumer purchasing power.",
    "TECH": "Neutral. Some tech companies are more resilient, but overall growth is challenged.",
