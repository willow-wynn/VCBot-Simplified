  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress and Public Square, but sentiment is mixed. The focus on PFE in the Public Square suggests potential interest, while Congressional activity indicates uncertainty. Executive actions are minimal, suggesting limited immediate policy impact. Overall, Discord activity reflects the current economic uncertainty.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) coupled with negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates stagflation. The unemployment rate (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low (35%), reflecting the overall negative sentiment.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles (e.g., Finance, Consumer Discretionary) will likely underperform, while defensive sectors (e.g., Healthcare, Consumer Staples) may offer some protection. Energy sector benefits from inflation. Expect increased risk aversion and a flight to safety.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic downturn. Volatility is set to 0.85 to account for the high inflation rate and market uncertainty. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence at 0.35. Momentum is adjusted to 0.20 to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.35 to acknowledge the current economic challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty. DIS and NFLX may face challenges.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and economic slowdown will negatively impact the financial sector. JPM, BAC, V, and GS are expected to underperform.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is a defensive sector and may benefit from increased risk aversion. JNJ, PFE, and UNH are expected to perform relatively well.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Manufacturing is sensitive to economic cycles, but infrastructure spending may provide some support. CAT and GE are expected to have mixed performance.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty. WMT, COST, and HD may face challenges.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies are sensitive to economic cycles and may face challenges due to rising interest rates. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are expected to have mixed performance.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation is sensitive to economic cycles, but defense spending may provide some support to Boeing. BA is expected to have mixed performance."
