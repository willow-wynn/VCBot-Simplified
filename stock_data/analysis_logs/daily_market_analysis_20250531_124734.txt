    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of political discussion and general chatter. The lack of focused financial discussion suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact on market sentiment. The 'Pride Month' comment and political statements in Public Square indicate potential social division, which can contribute to market uncertainty.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target (2.0%), indicating persistent price pressures. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) signals a potential recession. Unemployment (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), adding to the economic woes. These factors contribute to a bearish outlook.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and market sentiment, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely weigh on corporate earnings and investor confidence. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles, such as finance and consumer discretionary, may underperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction: Set to -0.25 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic downturn. volatility: Increased to 1.10 due to high inflation and economic uncertainty. market_sentiment: Remains at 0.35, aligning with low market confidence. momentum: Adjusted to 0.23 to reflect the slowing economic growth. long_term_outlook: Slightly decreased to 0.35 to reflect the increased risk of a prolonged economic downturn."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending on entertainment may decline due to economic pressures. DIS and NFLX face challenges.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Banks are vulnerable to economic downturns and potential interest rate hikes. JPM, BAC, and GS are expected to underperform.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces regulatory risks. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are expected to be relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral to Negative. Manufacturing is sensitive to economic cycles. CAT and GE face challenges due to slowing global growth.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decline due to high inflation and economic uncertainty. WMT and COST are expected to underperform.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies face valuation concerns and potential regulatory scrutiny. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are expected to be volatile.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation is affected by both consumer spending and manufacturing. BA and LMT have mixed outlooks, with defense potentially providing some stability."
