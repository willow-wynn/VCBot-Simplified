    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment is low, reflecting poor market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting the slightly above natural rate of unemployment. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced, reflecting the economic uncertainty."

    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Economic slowdown and supply chain issues will negatively impact manufacturing.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending may decline due to inflation, but discount retailers may perform relatively better.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. High growth tech stocks are sensitive to interest rates and economic slowdown.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Economic slowdown will reduce demand for transportation services."
