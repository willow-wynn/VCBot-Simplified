    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political and economic issues, with some skepticism towards market stability. The 'Public Square' channel reflects general uncertainty, while 'Executive' and 'Congress' channels indicate potential policy shifts. This suggests a cautious approach to the market.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators present a mixed picture. High inflation and negative GDP growth point to stagflation. Low unemployment provides some support, but overall, the economy is weak. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major concern.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic headwinds, the market is expected to be volatile with a slight downward trend. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles (e.g., manufacturing, finance) may underperform, while defensive sectors (e.g., healthcare, energy) could offer some protection. Market sentiment is weak, and risk appetite is low.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation. Market sentiment aligns with low confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to employment. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect current economic uncertainty."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to high inflation and potential supply constraints.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral outlook; consumer spending may be affected by inflation, but streaming services remain popular.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative outlook; rising interest rates and economic slowdown may impact bank profitability.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive outlook; defensive sector, less sensitive to economic cycles.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook; susceptible to economic slowdown and supply chain issues.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral outlook; discount retailers may outperform, while luxury goods may suffer.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to slightly negative outlook; high valuation and potential regulatory scrutiny.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative outlook; affected by economic slowdown and high fuel costs."
