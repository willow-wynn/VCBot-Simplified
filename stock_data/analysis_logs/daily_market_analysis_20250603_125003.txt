  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of concern and attempts at reassurance. The 'no money??? Sad' comment reflects the economic anxiety, while mentions of 'Fixed' and legislative activity suggest attempts to address the issues. Overall, Discord sentiment is slightly negative, contributing to lower market confidence.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture: high inflation, negative GDP growth, and unemployment slightly above the natural rate. This stagflationary environment warrants a cautious outlook. The Fed's struggle to control inflation is a major concern, and negative GDP growth further dampens the outlook.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic headwinds, the market outlook is bearish. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic cycles (e.g., manufacturing, finance) are likely to underperform, while defensive sectors (e.g., healthcare, consumer staples) may offer some relative protection. The high volatility suggests wider daily ranges for stocks.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (1.15) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to match the market confidence. Momentum is reduced (0.20) reflecting the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.35, reflecting the current economic concerns."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector remains relatively strong due to persistent inflation and supply constraints, but faces downside risk if the economy weakens significantly. Expect moderate gains.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector is vulnerable to economic downturns as consumer discretionary spending decreases. Expect underperformance.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector faces headwinds from potential interest rate hikes and a slowing economy. Expect underperformance.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector is considered defensive and should outperform the broader market during economic uncertainty. Expect moderate gains.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is highly sensitive to economic cycles and will likely underperform due to the negative GDP growth. Expect losses.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector is mixed. Consumer staples (WMT, COST) should hold up relatively well, while discretionary retail may struggle. Expect mixed performance.",
    "TECH": "Tech sector is sensitive to interest rates and economic growth. Expect underperformance, but with potential for selective gains in specific niches.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector is closely tied to economic activity and will likely underperform due to the slowing economy. Expect losses."
