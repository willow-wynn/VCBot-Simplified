    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low, reflecting the uncertainty. The economy is in a weak state.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic conditions, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative growth will likely lead to continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Investors are likely to be risk-averse, favoring defensive stocks. Expect continued volatility.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, matching the poor market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting some inertia in the market. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and supply constraints will likely keep energy prices elevated, benefiting energy companies.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment may decline due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and a slowing economy will negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector and should perform relatively well in a downturn.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. A slowing economy will reduce demand for manufactured goods.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral to Negative. Retailers may struggle as consumers cut back on spending due to inflation.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies are vulnerable to a slowing economy and rising interest rates.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation may be impacted by reduced economic activity, but some segments may benefit from supply chain disruptions."
