UNE
Mr. JOHNSON-KOAY (for himself, Ms. LONG of
Jackson, and Ms. TOWARD) introduced the following
bill;
——————————————————
A BILL
To amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to
establish an eighth fund to provide special financial assistance for
multiemployer pension plans in critical status and critical and
declining status and increase premium rates, to amend the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 to accommodate for such changes, and for other
purposes.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in
Congress Assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as—
(1) the “Relief and Assistance for Multiemployer Pensions Act of 2021”,
or;
(2) the “R.A.M.P. Act of 2021”.
SEC. 2 FINDINGS
Congress finds the following:
(1) The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insures about 23.5 million
under single-employer pension plans and about 10.9 million people under
multiemployer pension plans;
(2) The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020
Annual Report found that the multiemployer insurance program operating under
the corporation will become insolvent sometime in FY 2026;
(3) Over 70 multiemployer pension plans which the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation insures have already become insolvent, and around 130 are
expected to become insolvent in the next decade if the current course continues;
(4) Multiemployer pension plans insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation would be greatly affected by a PBGC Multiemployer Program
insolvency as only a small fraction of the current guarantee is funded by premiums;
(5) As a result of a PBGC Multiemployer Program insolvency, current
recipients of those plans insured under said program could see benefit levels drop
by as much as 90%, however all plans would be affected by insolvency;
(6) The impact of a drop in benefit levels as a result of program insolvency is
difficult to assess as current and future recipients are fairly evenly dispersed across
the country, however some areas would likely be affected to a greater degree as a
result of a difference in the amount of reliance, in regards to spending, etc., on such
recipients in local economies;
SEC. 3 SEVERABILITY

(a) SEVERABILITY.—Should any provision of this Act be deemed invalid or
unconstitutional for any reason in a court with relevant jurisdiction, the rest of this
Act, and the application of the remaining provisions, shall not be affected.
SEC. 4 AMENDMENTS TO THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME
SECURITY ACT OF 1974.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 4005 of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1305) is amended by adding at the end the following:
“(i) Establishment of eighth fund; purpose, availability, etc.
“(1) An eighth fund shall be established for special financial
assistance to multiemployer pension plans, as provided under section
4262, and to pay for necessary administrative and operating expenses
of the corporation relating to such assistance.
“(2) There is appropriated from the general fund such amounts
as are necessary for the costs of providing financial assistance under
section 4262 and necessary administrative and operating expenses of
the corporation. The fund established under this subsection shall be

financial assistance, the corporation shall accept the
determinations and demonstrations that a plan is in critical
status or critical and declining status (with the meaning of
section 305(b)) for certifications of plan status completed before
May 31, 2021, unless the corporation, in consultation with the
Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the
Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Labor, concludes
that determinations and demonstrations in the application were
clearly erroneous. For certifications of plan status completed
after June 1, 2021, a plan shall determine whether it is in
critical or critical and declining status for purposes of eligibility
for special financial assistance by using the assumptions that
the plan used in its most recently completed certification of plan
status before May 31, 2021, unless such assumptions (excluding
the plan’s interest rate) are unreasonable.
“(2) AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.—In determining
the amount of special financial assistance in its application, an
eligible multiemployer plan shall—
“(A) use the interest rate used by the plan in its
most recently completed certification of plan status before
May 31, 2021, provided that such interest rate may not
exceed the interest rate limit; and
“(B) for other assumptions, use the assumptions
that the plan used in its most recently completed
certification of plan status before May 31, 2021, unless
such assumptions are unreasonable.
“(3) INTEREST RATE LIMIT.—The interest rate limit for
purposes of this subsection is the rate specified in section

303(h)(2)(C)(iii) (disregarding modifications made under clause

special financial assistance is filed by the eligible multiemployer
plan or the 3 preceding months, with such specified rate
increased by 200 basis points.
“(4) CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS.—If a plan determines
that use of one or more prior assumptions is unreasonable, the
plan may propose in its application to change such assumptions,
provided that the plan discloses such changes in its application
and describes why such assumptions are no longer reasonable.
The corporation shall accept such changed assumptions unless
it, in consultation with the Director of the PBGC, the Secretary
of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Labor, determines the
changes are unreasonable, individually or in the aggregate. The
plan may not propose a change to the interest rate otherwise
required under this subsection for eligibility or financial
assistance amount.
“(g) APPLICATION DEADLINE.—Any application by a plan for
special financial assistance under this section shall be submitted to the
corporation (and, in the case of a plan to which section 432(k)(1)(D) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies, to the Secretary of the
Treasury) no later than December 31, 2025, and any revised
application for special financial assistance shall be submitted no later
than December 31, 2026.
“(h) DETERMINATIONS ON APPLICATIONS.—An application shall

days after the submission of such application unless the corporation
notifies the plan within such 90 days of an application error,
incompletion, or containment of determinations or demonstrations
deemed clearly erroneous, as defined in subsection (g). If a plan is
denied assistance under this subsection, the plan may submit a revised
application under this section. Any revised application for special
financial assistance submitted by a plan shall be deemed approved
unless the corporation notifies the plan within 90 days of the filing of

the revised application that the application is incomplete, any
proposed change or assumption is unreasonable, or the plan is not
eligible under this section. Special financial assistance issued by the
corporation shall be effective on a date determined by the corporation,
but no later than 1 year after a plan’s special financial assistance
application is approved by the corporation or deemed approved. The
corporation shall not pay any special financial assistance after
September 30, 2030.
“(i) MANNER OF PAYMENT.—The payment made by the
corporation to an eligible multiemployer plan under this section shall
be made as a single, lump sum payment.
“(j) AMOUNT AND MANNER OF SPECIAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.—
“(1) IN GENERAL.—Special financial assistance under this
section shall be a transfer of funds in the amount necessary as
