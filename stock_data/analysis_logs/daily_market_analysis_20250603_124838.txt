    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of concerns and attempts to address them. The 'no money??? Sad' comment reflects the economic anxiety. The high activity in Congress suggests legislative efforts to respond to the situation. Executive actions are also being taken. Overall, Discord activity indicates awareness and attempts to mitigate the economic downturn, but also underlying anxiety.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target (2.0%), indicating a need for tighter monetary policy. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) signals a recessionary environment. Unemployment (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), suggesting some labor market weakness. Market confidence is low (35%), reflecting the overall economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish in the short term. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely weigh on corporate earnings and investor sentiment. Increased volatility is expected. However, legislative and executive actions, along with potential Fed intervention, could provide some support and limit the downside. Long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, assuming effective policy responses.",
    "parameter_justification": "trend_direction: Set to -0.25 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall downward economic momentum. volatility: Set to 0.90 to reflect the high inflation rate and market uncertainty. market_sentiment: Aligned with the market confidence of 35%. momentum: Reduced to 0.20 to reflect the slowing economic growth and slightly elevated unemployment. long_term_outlook: Adjusted slightly downward to 0.36 to account for the current economic challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints will likely support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Neutral to Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment may decline due to economic concerns.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and a slowing economy could negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector and may perform relatively well during economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. A slowing economy and potential trade disruptions could negatively impact manufacturing activity.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decline due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies may face challenges due to slowing economic growth and potential regulatory headwinds.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation may be affected by slowing economic activity and supply chain disruptions."
