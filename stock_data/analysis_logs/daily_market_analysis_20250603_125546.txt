    "discord_impact": "The Discord activity suggests a general lack of confidence, with some negative sentiment in the public square. The Congress channel shows legislative activity, but the overall tone doesn't indicate strong market-moving initiatives. Executive actions are present, but their impact is unclear without more context. News channel activity is moderate.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation, negative GDP growth, and elevated unemployment (above the natural rate) all contribute to a bearish outlook. Market confidence is low, reflecting the economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord sentiment, the market outlook is bearish. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Sectors sensitive to economic growth (e.g., Finance, Retail) are likely to underperform, while defensive sectors (e.g., Healthcare) may offer some relative protection.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment aligns with the low market confidence. Momentum is reduced to reflect the slowing economy. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic headwinds."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Neutral to Positive: High inflation and potential supply constraints could support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative: Discretionary spending is likely to decrease in a recessionary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative: Interest rate hikes and economic slowdown will negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive: Healthcare is generally a defensive sector and less sensitive to economic cycles.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative: Manufacturing is sensitive to economic cycles and will likely suffer from reduced demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative: Consumer spending is likely to decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative: Tech companies are sensitive to interest rates and economic growth. Some segments may still perform well.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral: Mixed outlook. Some segments may benefit from infrastructure spending, while others suffer from reduced economic activity."
