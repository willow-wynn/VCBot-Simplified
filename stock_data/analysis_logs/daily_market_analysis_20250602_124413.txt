    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in political and news channels, suggesting uncertainty and potential volatility. The focus on midterms and international tensions (Iran) indicates a risk-off sentiment. The low activity in the 'States' channel suggests a lack of confidence in domestic policy.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture: high inflation, negative GDP growth, and an unemployment rate slightly above the natural rate. This stagflationary environment necessitates a cautious market approach.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic headwinds and negative market sentiment, a bearish outlook is warranted. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Energy sector may outperform due to geopolitical tensions. Defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples should hold up relatively well.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment reflects low confidence. Momentum is reduced due to economic slowdown. Long-term outlook is slightly lowered to reflect increased uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Outperform: Geopolitical tensions and supply constraints support higher energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Underperform: Discretionary spending is likely to decrease in a recessionary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Underperform: Banks face headwinds from a slowing economy and potential credit losses.",
    "HEALTH": "Outperform: Healthcare is a defensive sector that tends to hold up well during economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Underperform: Manufacturing is sensitive to economic cycles and will likely suffer from reduced demand.",
    "RETAIL": "Neutral: Consumer staples (WMT, COST) may outperform, while discretionary retail will struggle.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Underperform: Tech faces headwinds from higher interest rates and slowing growth.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Underperform: Reduced economic activity will negatively impact transportation demand."
