  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on legislative action, with Congress channel dominating message volume. Executive and State activity is minimal. Public Square discussions are active but lack clear market signals. News channel activity is low. Overall, Discord activity suggests a slight negative impact due to uncertainty surrounding legislative outcomes.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed target (2.0%) necessitates a high volatility parameter. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) justifies a negative trend direction. Low market confidence (35%) aligns with a low market sentiment parameter. Low unemployment (3.2%) slightly below the natural rate (3.5-4.0%) provides some positive momentum, but is overshadowed by other negative indicators.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to high inflation, negative GDP growth, and low market confidence. Increased volatility is expected. Sectors tied to government spending (e.g., Manufacturing, Transport) may experience some support, while consumer discretionary sectors (e.g., Entertainment, Retail) are likely to underperform. Energy sector may perform well due to inflation.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect negative GDP growth and economic momentum. Volatility is set to 1.15 to reflect the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is set to 0.35 to align with market confidence. Momentum is set to 0.25 to reflect the slightly positive unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is adjusted slightly to 0.41, reflecting the expectation that the Fed will eventually address inflation."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices. XOM, CVX, and COP are expected to perform well.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decrease due to high inflation. DIS and NFLX are expected to underperform.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face uncertainty due to potential interest rate hikes and economic slowdown. JPM, BAC, V, and GS are expected to be volatile.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant. JNJ, UNH, and PFE are expected to be relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Government spending on infrastructure may provide some support. CAT and GE are expected to be moderately affected by the economic slowdown.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decrease due to high inflation. WMT, COST, and HD are expected to underperform.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies face uncertainty due to potential interest rate hikes and economic slowdown. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are expected to be volatile.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Government spending on infrastructure may provide some support. BA is expected to be moderately affected by the economic slowdown."
