  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a mix of political discussion and general chatter, with limited direct impact on specific stock sentiment. The focus on political news and executive orders suggests potential policy-related uncertainty, but the lack of specific stock mentions limits the direct influence on individual stock prices. The public square chatter is mostly noise.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly above the Fed's target (2.0%) coupled with negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates stagflation. Low unemployment (3.2%) is a positive, but the market confidence is very low (35%). This suggests a risk-off environment where investors are wary of taking on risk.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic conditions, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to further declines in stock prices. The low market confidence reinforces this view. Expect increased volatility and a flight to safety. Sectors that are less sensitive to economic cycles, such as healthcare and consumer staples, may outperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative (-0.45) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (0.85) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to match the market confidence. Momentum is slightly negative (0.45) due to the weak economic growth and employment trends. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced (0.55) to reflect the increased uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints due to geopolitical factors may support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Discretionary spending is likely to decrease in a recessionary environment, negatively impacting entertainment companies.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and a slowing economy will likely hurt financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral to Positive. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector and may outperform during economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing is sensitive to economic cycles and will likely be negatively impacted by a recession.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies are sensitive to economic cycles, but some may benefit from increased demand for cloud computing and cybersecurity.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative. Reduced economic activity will likely decrease demand for transportation services."
