    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress, suggesting potential legislative impacts on the market. Executive and State level activity is low, indicating less immediate policy influence. Public Square activity is moderate, reflecting general market discussion. News mentions are minimal, suggesting no major breaking events.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target (2.0%), leading to increased volatility. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) indicates a recessionary environment, further supported by low market confidence (35%). While unemployment is low (3.2%), it's close to the natural rate, suggesting limited room for further improvement. The overall economic assessment is negative, warranting a cautious market approach.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic headwinds and low market confidence, a bearish market outlook is appropriate. Expect downward pressure on most sectors, with energy potentially being an exception due to inflationary pressures. High volatility is expected to persist. Focus on defensive stocks and sectors that are less sensitive to economic downturns.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (0.95) due to the significant inflation deviation. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to match the market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive (0.25) due to the low unemployment rate, but still reflects the overall economic slowdown. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.41 to reflect the current economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive outlook due to inflationary pressures and potential supply constraints. Expect increased demand and higher prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative outlook due to discretionary spending cuts during economic downturns. Consumers are likely to reduce entertainment expenses.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative outlook due to potential interest rate hikes and reduced lending activity. Increased risk of loan defaults.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral outlook as healthcare is generally recession-resistant. Demand for healthcare services remains relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative outlook due to reduced business investment and consumer spending on durable goods. Supply chain issues may persist.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative outlook as consumers reduce discretionary spending. Focus on essential goods retailers may perform better.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to slightly negative outlook. While some tech companies are essential, others face reduced demand for non-essential products and services.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Negative outlook due to reduced economic activity and trade. Lower demand for transportation services."
