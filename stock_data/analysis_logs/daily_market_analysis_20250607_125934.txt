    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political campaigns and news, suggesting heightened uncertainty. The limited discussion in Congress and Executive channels indicates potential gridlock. This contributes to negative market sentiment and increased volatility.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture: high inflation, negative GDP growth, and unemployment slightly above the natural rate. This stagflationary environment necessitates a cautious approach. The market is likely to be risk-averse, favoring defensive stocks and showing sensitivity to negative news.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic headwinds and political uncertainty, the market outlook is bearish. Expect continued volatility and downward pressure on prices. Investors should focus on capital preservation and consider defensive sectors. A short-term bounce is possible, but the overall trend is likely to be negative.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the Fed's target. Market sentiment is low, reflecting poor market confidence. Momentum is weak due to sluggish economic growth and rising unemployment. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect current economic concerns."

  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector is expected to perform relatively well due to persistent inflation and supply constraints. XOM, CVX, and COP are likely to be outperformers.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector faces challenges due to economic slowdown and discretionary spending cuts. DIS and NFLX may underperform.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector is vulnerable to interest rate hikes and potential recession. JPM, BAC, and GS are likely to experience downward pressure.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector is considered defensive and may outperform during economic downturns. JNJ, PFE, and UNH are expected to be relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector is sensitive to economic cycles and may suffer from reduced demand. CAT and GE are likely to face headwinds.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector is mixed, with discount retailers potentially benefiting from consumers seeking value. WMT and COST may outperform, while HD could struggle.",
    "TECH": "Technology sector is highly sensitive to interest rates and economic growth. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA are likely to experience volatility.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transport sector is impacted by economic slowdown and supply chain disruptions. BA is expected to face challenges."
