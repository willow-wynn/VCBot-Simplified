  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Public Square, Congress, and News channels, indicating active discussion of market-moving events. Executive channel activity suggests focus on specific policy impacts. The low activity in the States channel indicates less focus on state-level actions. Overall, the high volume of messages suggests heightened awareness and potential volatility.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target (2.0%), leading to increased volatility. Negative GDP growth (-1.2%) signals a potential recession. Unemployment (4.2%) is slightly above the natural rate (3.5-4.0%), adding to the economic strain. Market confidence is low (35%), reflecting the negative economic outlook.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to decreased corporate earnings and investor confidence. Increased volatility is expected due to economic uncertainty and active market discussions. Sectors sensitive to economic downturns, such as Finance and Transportation, may experience significant downward pressure. Energy may perform relatively better due to inflation.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is set to -0.30 to reflect the negative GDP growth and overall economic momentum. Volatility is set to 1.20 to account for the high inflation rate and market uncertainty. Market sentiment is aligned with the low market confidence at 0.35. Momentum is reduced to 0.10 due to the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is adjusted slightly to 0.35 to reflect the potential for future economic recovery, but remains cautious."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Energy sector (XOM, CVX, COP) is expected to perform relatively well due to inflationary pressures and potential supply constraints. Demand remains robust, providing support for prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Entertainment sector (NFLX, DIS, EA) faces challenges due to potential consumer spending cuts during an economic downturn. Streaming services and discretionary spending may decline.",
    "FINANCE": "Financial sector (JPM, BAC, V, GS, BRK.B) is vulnerable to negative impacts from rising interest rates and potential loan defaults. Lower consumer spending and investment activity will also weigh on earnings.",
    "HEALTH": "Healthcare sector (JNJ, UNH, PFE) is generally considered defensive, but may still experience some pressure due to economic slowdown. Demand for essential healthcare services remains relatively stable.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Manufacturing sector (CAT, GE, LMT) faces headwinds from slowing global demand and supply chain disruptions. Government spending on defense (LMT) may provide some support.",
    "RETAIL": "Retail sector (WMT, COST, HD) is sensitive to consumer spending patterns. Discount retailers (WMT, COST) may outperform during an economic downturn as consumers seek value.",
    "TECH": "Technology sector (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA) faces mixed prospects. While some companies benefit from cloud computing and digital transformation, overall spending on technology may decline during a recession.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Transportation sector (BA) is highly cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns. Reduced travel and freight activity will negatively impact earnings."
