    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a focus on political campaigns and some governance discussions. The presence of political ads suggests potential volatility related to policy changes. The lack of broad economic discussion indicates that the market is not heavily influenced by immediate social sentiment.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation coupled with negative GDP growth indicates stagflation. Unemployment is slightly above the natural rate, adding to the economic woes. Market confidence is low, reflecting the overall economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the stagflationary environment, the market is likely to experience continued volatility and a downward trend. Sectors that are defensive or benefit from inflation (e.g., Energy, Healthcare) may outperform, while growth-oriented sectors (e.g., Tech, Entertainment) may struggle. Overall, a cautious approach is warranted.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, mirroring the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to the slightly elevated unemployment. Long-term outlook is slightly decreased to reflect the overall economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. Benefits from inflation and potential supply constraints.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decrease in a stagflationary environment.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face increased risk from potential loan defaults and a slowing economy.",
    "HEALTH": "Positive. Defensive sector, less sensitive to economic downturns.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Neutral. Dependent on overall economic activity; faces challenges from inflation and supply chain issues.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decrease due to inflation and economic uncertainty.",
    "TECH": "Negative. Growth stocks are generally less attractive in a high-inflation, low-growth environment.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Mixed outlook; faces challenges from high fuel costs but may benefit from increased infrastructure spending."
