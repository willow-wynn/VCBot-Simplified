  "reasoning": {
    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows a high volume of congressional discussion, likely related to economic policy. News volume is low, suggesting a lack of major breaking events. Public square chatter indicates some frustration, but overall, the impact is considered neutral, with a slight negative bias due to the negative sentiment in the public square.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target of 2.0%, leading to increased volatility. GDP growth is negative (-1.2%), indicating a recessionary environment. Unemployment is low (3.2%), but this could be a lagging indicator. Market confidence is very low (35%), reflecting the economic uncertainty.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to the negative GDP growth, high inflation, and low market confidence. Expect increased volatility and downward pressure on stock prices. Long-term outlook is slightly pessimistic, but could improve if inflation is brought under control and GDP growth recovers.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative (-0.10) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (0.95) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to match the market confidence. Momentum is slightly reduced (0.45) to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced (0.54) to reflect the economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints due to geopolitical factors support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is likely to decrease in a recessionary environment, impacting entertainment companies.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face increased risk of loan defaults and reduced lending activity due to the economic slowdown.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces pressure from rising costs and potential policy changes.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing activity is likely to decline due to reduced demand and supply chain disruptions.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decrease, especially on non-essential items.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies face increased competition and reduced growth prospects due to the economic slowdown.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation is affected by both decreased consumer spending and increased energy costs."
