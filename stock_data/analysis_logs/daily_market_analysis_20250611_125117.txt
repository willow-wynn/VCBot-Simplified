High inflation (8.51%) far exceeds the Fed's target, GDP growth is negative (-1.2%), and market confidence is low (35%). While unemployment is low (3.2%), it's approaching the natural rate, limiting further potential gains. The economy is showing signs of stagflation.",
    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely lead to continued volatility. Investors are expected to be risk-averse, favoring defensive stocks. Energy sector may outperform due to inflationary pressures. Tech and Entertainment sectors are expected to underperform.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.30) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (1.15) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) aligning with the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive (0.25) due to the low unemployment rate, but overall economic conditions are weighing it down. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced (0.41) to reflect the current economic challenges."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints will likely drive energy prices higher.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer discretionary spending is expected to decrease due to inflation, negatively impacting the entertainment sector.",
    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks face headwinds from a slowing economy and potential interest rate hikes.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector, but faces cost pressures.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. Manufacturing will be impacted by slowing economic growth and supply chain issues.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Retail sales are expected to decline as consumers cut back on discretionary spending.",
    "TECH": "Negative. Tech companies face increased scrutiny and a potential slowdown in growth.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation will be affected by both slowing economic growth and inflationary pressures."
