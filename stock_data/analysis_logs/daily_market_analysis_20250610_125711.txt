    "market_outlook": "The market outlook is bearish in the short term due to stagflationary pressures. High volatility is expected. Long-term outlook is cautiously pessimistic, dependent on the Fed's ability to control inflation without severely impacting growth.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is negative to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low, mirroring the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive due to the low unemployment rate. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the overall economic uncertainty."

    "FINANCE": "Sensitive to interest rate hikes and economic slowdown. Expect moderate downside.",
    "HEALTH": "Relatively defensive, but still affected by inflation and potential government policy changes. Expect slight upside.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Vulnerable to decreased capital expenditure and consumer demand. Expect moderate downside.",
    "RETAIL": "Mixed outlook. Discount retailers may outperform, while luxury retailers will likely underperform. Overall, expect slight downside.",
    "TECH": "Highly sensitive to interest rate hikes and economic slowdown. Expect moderate downside.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Mixed. Lower consumer spending will hurt, but some companies will benefit from infrastructure spending. Overall, expect slight downside."
