High unemployment further exacerbates the situation. Market confidence is low. The economic situation warrants a cautious and defensive market stance.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish in the short term. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely put downward pressure on stock prices. Market sentiment is already low, and further negative news could trigger a sell-off. Expect increased volatility.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative due to GDP contraction. Volatility is high due to inflation significantly exceeding the target. Market sentiment aligns with low market confidence. Momentum is slightly positive, reflecting some underlying economic activity and employment trends. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to reflect the current economic challenges."

    "FINANCE": "Neutral to Negative. Banks may face challenges due to potential loan defaults and a slowing economy. Interest rate hikes could also impact profitability.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally considered a defensive sector, but rising costs and potential policy changes could create headwinds.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Negative. A slowing economy and potential trade disruptions could negatively impact manufacturing activity.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Consumer spending is likely to decline due to inflation and economic uncertainty. Discount retailers may outperform.",
    "TECH": "Neutral to Negative. Tech companies may face challenges due to slowing growth and increased regulation. However, some companies with strong fundamentals may still perform well.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation companies may face challenges due to slowing economic activity and rising fuel costs."
