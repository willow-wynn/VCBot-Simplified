    "discord_impact": "Discord activity shows high engagement in Congress, indicating policy discussions are active. Public Square shows some fatigue with current jokes, suggesting a need for fresh perspectives. News volume is very low, indicating a lack of major breaking events. Overall, Discord activity suggests a slightly negative sentiment due to policy uncertainty and a lack of positive news.",
    "economic_assessment": "The economic indicators paint a concerning picture. High inflation (8.51%) significantly exceeds the Fed's target (2.0%), while GDP growth is negative (-1.2%). Unemployment is low (3.2%), but this could be masking underlying issues. Market confidence is very low (35%). The economy is showing signs of stagflation.",
    "market_outlook": "Given the economic indicators and Discord activity, the market outlook is bearish. High inflation and negative GDP growth will likely put downward pressure on stock prices. Low market confidence suggests investors are risk-averse. Expect increased volatility and a general decline in stock values. Sectors sensitive to economic growth, such as finance and consumer discretionary, are particularly vulnerable.",
    "parameter_justification": "Trend direction is strongly negative (-0.50) to reflect the negative GDP growth. Volatility is high (0.85) due to the significant deviation of inflation from the target. Market sentiment is low (0.35) to match the low market confidence. Momentum is slightly negative (0.45) to reflect the slowing economic growth. Long-term outlook is slightly reduced to 0.55 to reflect the current economic uncertainty."
  },
  "sector_outlook": {
    "ENERGY": "Positive. High inflation and potential supply constraints support energy prices.",
    "ENTERTAINMENT": "Negative. Consumer spending on discretionary items like entertainment may decline due to inflation.",
    "FINANCE": "Negative. Rising interest rates and economic uncertainty could negatively impact financial institutions.",
    "HEALTH": "Neutral. Healthcare is generally recession-resistant, but faces cost pressures.",
    "MANUFACTURING": "Slightly Negative. Manufacturing may suffer from reduced demand due to economic slowdown.",
    "RETAIL": "Negative. Inflation is eroding consumer purchasing power, hurting retail sales.",
    "TECH": "Slightly Negative. Tech companies are sensitive to economic cycles, but some segments (cloud, cybersecurity) are more resilient.",
    "TRANSPORT": "Neutral. Transportation is essential, but faces challenges from high fuel costs and supply chain disruptions."
